169818,1,"I'm not the most mechanically inclined person in the world but where there is a will, there is a way. This was very easy and it did an incredible job with my 1971 CB500!"
22480,1,Arrived with the packaging damaged but doesn't affect the Camco. The unit is well built and was a great buy.
13730,0,"I have had several of these over the last 12 years. The heat pak (the one you take out and heat in the microwave) doesn't last but a few years if heating in the microwave about once or twice a week. However, the outside cover lasts forever. I do think the price is a little high for only being able to use the heating pak for about 2 - 3 years."
170819,0,"thought it was bigger in the description, still trying to find adapter parts to make it work. not long enough.. but a good value for the price."
72745,2,"The gasket set came complete, however, one gasket I needed, wasn't in there. It was also missing about 5 o-rings, so I had to go and source those separately. The quality of the gaskets is OK, not quite as good as the OEM gaskets. I wouldn't go with the Moose gasket kit again given my experience with this kit. I did make sure this kit fit my model, and yet it still wasn't what I would consider a ""complete"" gasket kit."
36309,1,This is the very good fit for our car. You should replace it by yourself if you haven't. The illustration and package are in German. But it is very easy.
95468,0,I bought the necklace and bracelet combination to match. I wore the necklace 3 times and the clip already broke.
188385,0,"***Review for the item itself, not its usefulness***I ordered two of these as Christmas gifts, and instead of receiving two boxes, two key chains, and two sets of instructions, I received one small box that contained only one instruction set and the 2 key chains. Since someone who has never seen this before is going to need the instructions, one of the key chains instantly became obsolete. And since just wrapping the odd-shaped key chain doesn't look presentable at all, it only aggravated me more. Two individual boxes and instruction sets should have been included."
54777,0,"I agree with RTV Owner and Robinhood ...the specs on this tach (when I purchased it) stated it would work on small engines, which is the only reason I bought it. I was very puzzled when opened the package and found settings on the back for only 4,6 or 8 cylinder. I plan to keep it and have purchased a tach signal converter to see if that works if not will resell on ebay."
25573,1,"works great, hasnt fallen out yet, fits in the window just like its supposed to. I took a piece of velco and stuck it to it to keep from flopping around."
34335,0,"I live in Sunny Florida so naturally I wanted some window shades to help keep my car cool and prevent fading inside my car & dash. These are easy to install, clean window, peel off, stick on then draw the shades. You can easily slide them on or off if you don't want them while driving, they actually don't bother me, you get use to them being there. The hook or latches stay in place though since you have glued them to your windshield. The ""spring back"" on these blinds is excellent! Everything sounds great right. Unfortunately, after 1 week in the sun one side came un-glued. NOW what do I do? Without the shade latches sticking to your windshield these are useless. Either they need to make a glue that can stand the HEAT or find a way to attach it to your windshield without glue. So this was all great but in the end, it is flawed rendering it useless."
13544,1,"Why should you need a review of an ignition coil? Unlike that bestselling latest novel from some overly analytical, self-absorbed, new-wave twenty something, this is an ignition coil. If you got a Ford based product that specifies this model ignition coil, this is the coil for you. I laughed, I cried, I got all girly inside."
94567,0,"Bought this in Jan 2011, now the mechanic told me I need the rear pads replaced. The OEM lasted from 2004 (new) and I was never a hard-breaking driver not to mention the daily drive to work is less than 4 miles ;) . I am going back to OEM especially for the price."
76290,0,"I have two on my truck, they work great and you can adjust them anyway you want them, however both mirrors came off due to heat. I live in Northern California so I am questioning how will they perform in other states with real heat waves. Anyway I was lucky enough to find both on my drive way, so I just super glue them and so far they have stayed attached."
145947,1,"Ordered the wrong item, they helped me get the correct part without any hesitation. Would definitely work with them again."
100047,1,Best piston for good price. I got this 67.50mm piston for my project 2004 yfs200 blaster if you are looking for power go with this piston. Now my front tires come up like nothing in 1st to 3rd gear. Want more power but dont want to bore the cylinder out go with this piston. Would recommend to anyone.
133613,1,I purchased two of these keyless entry remotes for my 2005 Ford Escape. It was very easy to program and the price was great. Much cheaper than buying from a dealer. I purchased the car used and received one very worn remote where the remote lock wasn't even working so it was almost worthless. I was able to use it to unlock the car plus it had been used quite a bit so the pictures were halfway worn off. I really wanted to have one for each key and found these on Amazon. I also was able to match the model number online with the original one that I had to make sure this would work. Both worked so I now have a spare in case I need it. I'm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to everyone. It's a fraction of what the dealer would charge for the key fob and the cost of programming it. No need to pay all that money to someone else. Shipping was also very quick which was a plus.
150591,0,"This is a great idea but the fitment into the receiver is a little poor . I have a 09 GMC and it has an original equipment receiver on it . There is about a quarter inch worth of play in it when installed so it rattles around pretty good . I put a shim in it and it seems to work well . I would not put too much in it for adding a light trailer off the hitch but if you stay very light you should be OK . I think it is a great concept , easy to use but quality control is an issue in my opinion ."
76805,2,I had 195000miles on my stock bilstein shocks when i installed theese. the ride quality was better before i started. it seems to be harsh over small bumps and ok offroad and i do mean offroad not some dirt trail. i woud not use theese again.
7294,0,At first look this product looks exactly like original mirror. Only problem I have is while driving the mirror vibrates and can be rather annoying to look through.
10674,1,"I had been looking for something to clean up the clutter in the cargo area of my Ford Edge. After reading all the positive reviews on the organizer, I decided that it was just what I've been looking for. I have not been dissappointed. It fits nicely against the back seat and holds all the small items that tend to accumulate back there. It even holds a small cooler, along with a few of those plastic grocery bags that always let the bottles and cans escape. As for the strong vinyl spell, it's really no big deal. I let it air out for a few days and the smell was negligeable. All in all a great product. It even folds flat if your not using it."
154961,0,"This item fit right into place. However, one of the bolt holes was off, so I was not able to put that bolt in. My only plan for the hitch is to haul my kid's bikes around on a bike rack, so I'm not too worried about the one missing bolt."
56841,0,They rip in palm after 3 weeks of use. Not very happy with them need more strenthg in palm area would not reccomend
96097,1,For several years I was having a problem with the Sylvania Silverstar bulbs burning out every 6 to 12 months. I loved the light so much that I tolerated it and replaced them with the same bulb.I was using the practice of letting the Camry turn the lights on automatically with a turn of the ignition key. The process was (1) lights turn on (2) engine starts. I could see the lights flutter a little during the starting process.I then experimented by manually turning on the lights AFTER the car was started. It has now been 2 years with NO BULB BURNOUTS. I believe turning the ignition with the lights already in auto on creates extra wear and tear resulting in more frequent burn-outs.
182762,1,Very easy installation. Clear instructions on where/how to install. Works on 2004 Nissan Frontier crew cab. Much more efficient that splicing raw wires.
77628,2,"Like many others, I have been in an ongoing search to find the ""perfect"" wiper blades. I guess they don't exist!I installed a new pair of these blades before we took a 300-mile driving trip to Minnesota. On the way, we drove through rain, sleet, and snow. The temperature was in the 30s the whole way (never below freezing).The blades chattered and streaked. Yes, I did install them properly. These blades are not listed as ""summer-only"" so I assume they were designed to work in cold weather. For us, they did not.So, it's back to the drawing board. I have used Bosch blades in the past. They are OK. I will also be trying some Rain-X."
167641,1,"This was the best price I had found. And they had it in stock, whereas other places said they did on their web site but in reality it was back ordered."
73605,0,nice design of this item to stop the car - the watch out is: clean the garage floor and expect that the unit may not stay stuck to the floor. If you turn the wheel while parked on it the force can cause it to let loose.
72868,2,"I'm having to return the chain (wonderful shipping cost). I trusted the site to be accurate in sizing = I was wrong. The CORRECT chain for Honda Rebels (CMX-250) is 520-108. That would be 6 links LONGER than what Powersports state here. Nice time to find out is not when the bike is off the ground with new sprockets, brakes, and you are trying to fit a SHORT chain (groan). With shipping three ways, the good price is a distant memory."
142313,0,I have used purolator air filters for over 30 years and they make a good quality product.I believe that purolator products are equal to quality to fram products and at a lower price.Just don't be foolish enough to purchase any automotive filter made in China regradless of the price.You do in most instances get what you pay for!
72222,1,This product really allows my suzuki gsxr to breathe better - Its a great item and i will be sure to recommend you to other bike riding friends of mine.
118051,0,This charger charges my two Harleys. That's about all I can say. I wish it was little better made. They made the shell out of cheap plastic. If it was made with a metal or heavy plastic case it would have made me feel better about spending the cash.
48744,0,"I bought mine in August 2008 and it lasted until January 2012 only being used about 2 or 3 times a year. It appears that the fuse blew and from what I read on-line, the fuse is soldered so my unit will just go in the trash. The good -- it was a powerful pump and worked well on bike tires. The bad -- the fuse, the power cable and air hose are too short, the switch is very inconveniently located, and the calibrations on the pressure gauge aren't detailed enough to hit specific numbers like 28psi. I will buy a different brand to replace this one."
377,2,"I have to agree that the new plastic ""safety"" spout is absolutely scary. First it is fragile and I have broken one when the weight of the can fell on the spout mechanism while filling my 4X4. I have had trouble both getting the spout to open and other times getting it to seal closed after using. I cannot comprehend how this mandated spout, obviously designed by a committee, works better than the old metal spout to 1) reduce spills(?)in actual hands on use 2) Keep fuel vapor out of the air?To make the new style plastic spout stop frustrating me, I threw it away. I bought a new flexible metal spout ""similar"" to the old style military spout. Effort required to make this spout work, substantial, and likely beyond most peoples ability. It requires modifying the can. It also requires obtaining, or making, the old style flat gasket.The rim of the fill hole must be drilled and a vent tube soldered in place (new, un-used cans only, unless you really know what you are doing) The vent tube is bent so that its far end ends up in the top back corner of the can. This allows air to enter the can from the small hole in the rim as the fuel is poured in the tank. The new metal spout has a gasket that does not cover that vent hole. The old style flat gasket is required to seal that hole when the wide flange metal cap is installed for transport. If you can, take a look at an old GI gas can to see how it works.With this modification there is no ""glug"" as you pour fuel. Even the new plastic mandated spout ""glugs"" slowing fill and making the can hard to support in the pouring operation. This information is not complete as I cannot supply a diagram here. This information is for interest and education only and I do not recommend that you modify your can this way.Check many sellers as the price for the Blitz can varies widely depending on the store selling through Amazon. Average is $45 but with some research through Amazon I found a vendor who had them for $32 with free shipping if I bought 2. The Blitz can is the best. I personally believe that gasoline should ONLY be transported in a metal can. Do not store fuel with the plastic cap as the can closure. Use the metal bung seal cap. Also realize that alteration of the can takes it out of compliance with Fed and state DOT regs for transporting fuel."
168696,1,Great jacket for the price just waiting for the summer so can put to good use.
161301,2,"I purchased and installed the sensor in April of 2008. It worked for 1.5 years and then the car began to idle rough and miss upon acceleration. Upon inspection of the sensor I noticed that the top 'cover', which had been glued back on during the refurbish process, had come loose and was dangling off of the sensor. Live and learn I guess. From now on I will only purchase new when it comes to this type of an item."
16943,2,"I bought eight of the Optima yellow top batteries for house batteries in a sailboat for the convenience of AGM, no fill, no spill, etc. These batteries are charged by a state of the art 4 stage regulator, plus solar panels on a microprocessor charge controller. The batteries are all in one bank and charged/discharged equally and never below 85%. In other words they are pampered. Now the bad, one battery failed within a week of installation. It started gassing and heating up even under a light charge. After about a year another one developed an internal short and its voltage dropped to around 8V. It was easy to detect by just touching the top. It was warmer than the rest. Six months after that, two more developed internal shorts with the same symptoms. These batteries are over rated. It appears that the build quality from battery varies widely. I will never buy another one."
95334,0,"This is a great idea poorly executed. It seems to be heavy duty construction which is nice, and it is galvenized so it 'should' last a while. The 2 things that let it down are the wheel, which is a light duty plastic thing, and the swivel joint which allows the jack to flex while I push the trailer around my back yard. It shouldn't be flexing at all.The ground in my yard is soft, so the hard plastic wheel easily digs in and gets caught. Overall not a terrible product and gets the job done...but would I buy it again? Really not sure. I did buy one years ago in Australia for $20 which was far superior to this...but that's a long way to go for a jockey wheel."
141170,1,"The fit of this product is outstanding!And the price,out of this world!In todays times factory parts can be a hassle & expensive! If not for walker products and amazon,this would be a Greek tragedy! Darlene Smith"
38590,2,"I received product quickly. I followed the instructions carefully to repair a hole/chip with no cracks from a kicked up rock. After multiple attempts I gave up. I was very dissapointed. Perhaps it may work in your application, but I am unable to recommend based on my experience."
119325,0,"The actual coupler I received has a nylon (?) insert as the ramp part of the coupler and when I tried to use it on a pressed in grease fitting, it pulled the fitting out. Most likely an issue with the fitting in how it was pressed in and this would not happen with a threaded fitting. It does the job."
40584,2,"Unfortunately, it compresses down to 1/2 inch or so pretty quickly. Other wedges are better."
169605,0,"I bought this chain to go with a white gold pendant since a white gold chain can be very expensive. Unfortunately, it was not a good match. The colors are way too different. I have a silver chain that looks a lot like white gold, but this one is too white. It looks too fake, even for silver. I wear a silver bracelet every day and it looks too white next to that one as well.An ok choice by itself but I would not pair it with white gold or even another silver item."
53601,0,"It charges at .75 amps/hour so to charge a fully drained 12V battery takes like 16 hours. It's small and compact, but I'd rather a bigger one that charges faster."
99886,0,"This dashmat is not an exact fit. Although it is contoured to much of the dash, it is too long in areas. This makes it buckle in certain spots. I have given it time to ""relax"" in the heat, and if the dashmat were cut to fit better, it would probably sit evenly across the dash. The problem is you can't trim the mat without cutting the binding on the border. If you did it would fray. Thus, an imperfect product that is fair at best. The Ultimat is a Dashmat product that is supposedly an exact fit to every vehicle, but it's not made for this car. I emailed the company to see why they don't offer their Ultimat for the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder. I was sent a very basic response that indicated to me that they just didn't care. I don't think I'd recommend this product or company."
52930,1,"a high quality hitch cover. very good weight and design is protected by a clear resin finish. the rear stud that fits into the hitch receiver is solid metal and sets very snuggly inside, so as not to bounce around."
36187,0,"I've only just started using this converter and I haven't tried using all my devices on it. So far, it does what it's suppose to do, but the unit is very noisy. Also the plastic by the fuse on this was a bit damaged upon arrival. For the price it has been a good investment so far."
78945,0,"The price was right so I bought a few of these. I do not find them very easy to use. They have to be perfectly lined up to get a reading and not let air out of the tire. The display is not that readable either. At the price, they are okay, but not great."
89230,0,"My own fault perhaps for not reading the product description carefully. This serves more as a headband, not a mens tie to wear."
157444,1,This is a great tool. I have problems with arthritis and this realy makes thing easier to do. Plenty of power for all around thigs from toys to furniture and cars.
7378,2,Aims products are unreliable and their customer service will let you down. I have had to send the same product back 3 times. After the 3rd time they said nothing was wrong and I would have to pay to have the defective equipment returned to me. I am in contact with the Attorney General office in Nevada and have contacted the BBB in Reno. I hope they will be able to help me get a refund. BEWARE of any AIMS products.
102380,1,"I ordered because it came on my weed eater. I wanted to be surethat I got what was recommended. Your price was way too highbut I paid it any how. I now bought a new weedeater, Stihl.The plug wasn't my problem. Thanks anyway.Carlton Reid"
117862,1,"Well i have to say that i have been looking to replace my handles since the gear mechanism in the originals broke, a friend recommended ""the zon"" to me and i must admit...I' m hooked! the handles i ordered are the same size, and i really don't care that it came in black, but the problem that i'm facing is that the tube where it connects to the seat is way to long.(original handle tube 1/4 in.; new handle tube 3/4 in.) my only option at this point is to find longer screw than what came with them and see if that will hold in place. yeah it might stick out further than designed to but at least i can operate my seats again. Open to suggestions"
58099,1,"Man, this thing is killer! My wife can barely lift it, but that's okay. I always have her back. I plan to use this for back-up power to run the fan in my fireplace when the power goes out."
139582,0,"As a Snowbirder, have battery charge problems with Golf Cart not used for several months during the summer. Trickle Charger should work"
80416,1,I use Purolators Air and Oil filters on all my vehicles. Great price and fast shipping on Amazon............Gotta Luv it.
43402,0,"purchased this when my car battery died in carpool line one day and i didn't have jumper cables. while i feel better about having an emergency kit in the car at all times now, i feel i really could have spent the money on ""really good"" jumper cables and and put together the rest of the ""kit"" myself. not the best bang for the buck, but it serves it's purpose and i'm glad i have it."
33310,0,"I bouhgt this for my Nissan Sentra SE-R20 like the trim idicated it has a 2000cc engine everything bigger in this model, starting with the engine, the body, the bars off course so the bushing did not fit and I had to adapt them by wearing the inside of them. They work fine but I'm not that happy with the part finder, I feel like it is not that dependable."
148845,1,"Had one basically like this before, but had elastic straps and after 7 years they lost their elasticity. Not sure why some complained that it doesn't have CD slots, since it is not advertised with them. Perfect for holding paperwork. Doesn't impede vision or block vanity mirror."
151825,1,"We got this for my wife, as I like to keep the car cold when I drive. So, it works great for her."
100714,1,"I've been pulling plugs for 35 years, grounding them and looking for spark, until now. What a Great Addition to my arsenal of tools for troubleshooting. It's built very well, and works great. What more can I say!"
19051,2,"They look and feel ok, except that the rubber nibs from one mat sink into the one below it so it looks like you have a bunch of perforations in the mat (I'm assuming this is from when they are in storage or are packed). I would guess that this would go away after some use. Unfortunately they must have cut to the wrong pattern because they did not fit my car at all. I am returning them and will probably order from someone that maintains inventory specifically for my make/model."
61411,0,"I have a similar story to one of the other reviewers. It arrived with a picture but no instructions. Here are the instructions in case you find the same thing happen to you:[...]That wouldn't be so bad right? I mean they don't show you but you get the idea. I do wish they had some view of how the brace and handle went together but whatever. The problem is, like the other person, I have to drill holes to make this work. I looked at it awhile and tried every different way possible. I have not only put together my fair share of stuff I used to work in customer service helping others put together their stuff. So I drill holes because that is the easiest. You should know that this could be you. Good luck!"
105247,0,Best price - fast shipping. Haven't put them in the car yet! Looks like good quality; well made.
175644,1,"I've totally redecorated the inside of my truck with mossy oak. This was the finishing touch. Unfortunately, with all my airbags, side air bags, canopy air bags, it is hard nowadays to find a spot to put it. It has a strap for those that don't want to use the velcro attachments. I have mine sitting in my center console, not to any fault of its own, but because my passenger compartment is basically ""air-bag-ized""The inside seems to be designed to be wiped out if it gets dirty.But, because of the material it is made of, if it gets too grimy I'll just try to pop it in the wash. We will see. So far, I'm very happy with this product."
31804,0,"I have not used the carrier as of yet but the center receiver bar is made of the same metal as the rest of the carrier. This may or may not cause a problem but most receiver bars are made of 1/4 "" steel and this on is 1/8"" steel. My concern, although unfounded at this time, is that it may not hold up when the carrier is fully loaded. The description indicates it is rated for up to 500 lbs and I hope it is correct."
149434,2,"One of the bulbs is already not working. The housing look cheap, These lights are not submersible.... DO NOT SUBMERGE THESE LIGHTS!!!! they will rust in 2 days and will cause electrical problems in your car.A little bit better craftmanship can go a long way. We should demand a little bit better quality from chinese products. They can do better. We pay with good currency we should get good products.I plan to place 2 2x4 in the light mounts and raise these lights 2 feet, better visibility and they will be out of the water when you back-up the trailer into the water."
47983,1,This product was exactly what was described. It was hipped on a timely basis. I would buy from this person again!
66904,1,"I recommend these visors for all automobiles, especially to allow you to leave the windows down a little when parked to let the heat escape. I only purchase the ""in channel "" type as they look better than the "" tape on "" type and they are easy to install.These particular ones are also lightly tinted so visibility ""through"" them is good and they don't block your view, plus they look nice on the car."
76074,0,I bought mine in 2005 and it was too difficult to install myself. I also felt wireless had to mean easy. I was putting it in a Pickup Truck. I hired someone to do the work and that doubled the price. BUT it did work fine until recently. All of a sudden it does not seem to be working. I cannot find what is wrong. Also one stick on sensor did come loose. I think I have it back on well enough until I figure out if this will have to be replaced. it does come with a 2 year warranty which is good.When it worked it worked great.
39864,1,Very happy w/the product and the shipping service. This filter sells for more at most other sights. Would reccommend this to people I know.
171139,1,"Recieved mine just a few days after ordering - and I live in Europe! Good quality, good service! Will come back for more parts."
18255,1,"After being convinced vacuum extraction removes ALL the old oil and ALL the sludge (it does), I researched a variety of oil and fluid extractors.Extraction is especially recommended for Mercedes, BMW, VW and vehicles where the oil filter is accessable from above. You could change oil and clean up wearing a business suit. And fast.Run the engine to warm and churn the oil. Remove the dipstick and insert the extractor tube (several sizes supplied). Operate the extractor. Used oil is viewed and measured through the translucent side of the extractor. Replace the filter and refill the crankcase. Pour out the old oil - into soda bottles if you wish - it's that neat and accurate.Under carriage inspection is indeed important and I plan to remove the undercover and do it again sometimes after the snow melts, if it gets warmer or when I have time.This type extractor seems best for automobiles, as many are designed for boats and small engines. Some extractors leak when used with synthetic oil, but most manufacturers have changed seal material and will supply replacements if a problem exists. A rare few older engines do not present a suitable path for dipstick oil extraction.The Mityvac 7400 Oil Extractor from Amazon was the right model at the best price. Delivery was virtually instant. I plan to order others. Soon my automotive DIY friends will be out from down under and walking upright again, but maybe not in business suits."

132180,2,"I received the bulbs in Feburary, along with the harnesses. I had them put in later that month or the beginning of March, can't remember when I took it in and had them installed. One of the bulbs quit working last week. It was the bulb and not the harness because the factory bulb is back in using the harness and it works fine. I now have one factory bulb and one of these blue bulbs, which looks silly but wondering how long the second bulb will last. I am going to their website to see what type of warranty they have. No wonder I see cars going around all the time with only one colored bulb working. I like the clear sight I had, and the cool look, but not worth paying that much to have to replace it every 7-8 months.The Second bulb burned out a few days ago so it lasted just about one month longer than the first one. The cost of the bulbs has come down since I purchased them the first time but still is it worth this much to have to replace them so often? There is another vendor I found on line that guarantees their bulbs for 10 years, and their bulbs are a deeper blue."
103742,1,"An excellent product. Perhaps a bit larger than I had thought, but is an item I have not seen available in Australia. It fits beautifully, is solid in construction and I stand out from the crowd. Thank you a great product"

182718,2,"One of my 4 Neoprene seat covers got ripped by a vacuum cleaner after just 1 year, something that should not happen to begin with. But Coverking customer service is not helping and would not sell just the replacement seat cover, has to sell 2 at a time, at full retail. Beware of their durability and quality control, and definitely beware of the customer service, or lack thereof."
85348,1,"I bought this for my Suzuki Boulevard C50 because I wanted a washable filter that lasted a long time. I heard people talking about how a K&N filter gave them extra power. I didn't really believe all that, but after I installed this filter on my bike, there was a small yet noticeable increase in power. I am happy! Extra performance on a washable filter that will last me for the life of the bike."

130923,2,"I thought this was a great deal on a box of these disks... looking at the $100+ suggested retail price. I got ONE disk, and the shipping cost more than the disk itself, which would not have been bad if it was a BOX of disks, but for one, I would have been better off going to a local body shop, or buying several at once."
132294,1,This hitch cover is nice looking. not as heavy as i thought it would be. it has to be put together. still looks good on my sons truck.
187546,0,"The unit does its job as advertised. I've used it to inflate bicycle and car tires. It's able to achieve the high pressure needed by road bikes (100+ PSI). The accessories do NOT include an adapter for road bike ""presta"" valves, but that's inexpensive to pick up at a bike or hardware store.The unit is pretty noisy, and doesn't appear much different from other small inflaters powered by 12V cigarette lighter adapters. I was hoping that it would be more beefy, but it looks like it is the same type of unit with a different power source."
113997,0,"The installation was not easy although you would think it would be. The filters construction, the outer rubber sealing lip would not allow the air filter cover to close properly. I had to trim the outside edge to bevel it so that it would close properly, quite the hassle. On the plus side the bike runs better and for sure gets better gas mileage about 3-4 mpg. 2005 Suzuki C50T."

102825,1,"Here is a great helmet for riding on the open road.It has the retro classy look to it and is very comfortable to wear.I bought this helmet in anticipation of purchasing a motorcycle this coming summer.The helmet was well packaged and it came in a scratch free clothbag with a closing drawstring (I thought that was a great idea).I have always liked the half helmets,so when I decided to make plans to buy a motorcycle this was my first and only choice.The visor was very easy to snap on and adjusting the chin strap was a breeze.Shoei really did a great job in doing this helmet retro!The removeable ear protection is nice and well padded.I like the idea that it has a zipper to remove the leather ear protectors as this won't wear out if it were velcro.I opted for the color white as the motorcycle handbook was always mentioning being highy visable to others on the road (what better color,right?).It is well constructed and will last for years to come.I look forward to wearing it as I ride on my new motorcycle on the open road."
140504,1,Best item I've bought in a while. My car was acting up and I wasn't sure what was wrong. Once I got this item and hooked it up I knew instantly exactly what I needed to do to fix it.

37960,0,"I bought an 1134 from Amazon and it is not Made In USA. On to the coupler... there is nothing in the user manual about how it works. And good luck getting any help from Lincoln!The coupler knurled section is tightened for shipping and you need to break it loose before you use it. It will go on and pull off the zerk until you pump grease and then it will not let go until you back off the knurled section. Don't try it on a zerk that is in a pocket that prevents you from getting your fingers on the knurled section or you may never get it off the zerk. When you have the coupler on a zerk as you rotate the knurled section you can feel the change in how it grips the zerk from locked on to loose and removable.This feature? may be nice because you don't have to hold it on to the zerk and it will allow very high pressure. But if you need to use it in an area like a U-joint with a zerk that is deep in the spider, and you can't get to the knurled section of the coupler, you have to find a setting that will allow you to pull the coupler off and still seal to the zerk enough to push grease in and not just splooge all over. Pushing the coupler against the zerk while you pump does not seal at all.Also, if you don't uncock the cartridge spring it pushes the oil portion of the grease out the nifty Lincoln Grease Gun Filler Pump Nipple on the head."
113882,2,I bought this under the impression that it did not contain lead so that I could use it on my pets' automatic water bowl. This item came with a warning sticker on it regarding the contents containing lead. I later found one locally that does not contain lead.
683,0,"I usually mop the floor on my hands and knees with a wash cloth or scrubby sponge and soapy water. We just moved to a bigger place and I really don't want to do that with such a big kitchen floor. (I have a linoleum kitchen floor.) I've never found a mop I really liked, so I did the research and selected this one based on reviews. I mop more often now that I have this mop (about 2 to 3 times a week instead of every two weeks or so), but at the same time, I know I would get my floor cleaner if I got on my hands and knees and did it my old way (I'm also 7 months pregnant and can't bend very well).I like not having to fill my kitchen sink or a bucket with water to be able to mop. It's much less time consuming and I can mop my entire kitchen in about 20 minutes now. It does work better than any mop I've ever used before. My husband won't mop without a mop, so this is great for getting him to help, too. I have toddlers who constantly drop food on the floor and I'm too lazy to clean up every little drop immediately, so I do have to scrub a little dried food off my floor when I do mop, but that's not too big a deal.I use a spray bottle with a Pinesol solution in it to spray the floor before I mop (and after I sweep) and then I wet the mop head and let the excess water drip into the sink. The floor dries really quickly if the head isn't sopping wet. I do have to rinse the head or change the pad a couple of times. If you decide to get this mop, I would recommend getting extra mop heads at the same time (I bought 2 extras and it's been nice) to save on shipping. I really like just being able to throw the dirty mop head in the washer when I'm done too."

44389,0,"I purchased this multimeter looking for the best in the low-budget class (under $40). The size and form factor is just about perfect. It feels good in the hand and can be strapped to the wrist for freeing up both hands while working. The oversized display is clear and easy to read.This multimeter is geared more toward automotive measurements than engineering so those looking for hFE, capacitance, and very low current measurements (microamperes) might want to look elsewhere. I found accuracy to be pretty good overall, however resistance measurement across bare leads did not read zero Ohms as it should. I had no success measuring microamperes with this meter.For the price I wish there were more features. The battery measurement is a nice touch other meters don't have as it shows what battery voltage is under load, but if you subtract 1/2 volt on an ordinary voltmeter's reading you'll get roughly the same results."
62728,0,"The product itself is good, but the packaging left a little to be desired. When I opened the box, one bottle was MISSING A CAP, so understandably there was stuff oozing around. Fortunately the stuff is not watery so it didn't spill all over. But seriously, how do you ship out a bottle that doesn't have a cap? How does someone miss that?!? My guess is that a machine automates the whole packaging process from filling the bottle, to putting on a cap, to putting bottles in the box and sealing the box. This must have been a bad batch from a glitch in the system. How else could you explain a bottle missing a cap? Anyways, that leaves me with 11 usable bottles and for the price I paid, I won't go through the trouble of returning it."
127839,1,I had an earlier version of this guage prior to my truck getting broken into and now someone else is enjoying it. My wife bought me another for a replacement as I really found the guage usefull and what a surprise - it now lights up to show you the pressure when you check. Very nice improvement I discovered the evening I checked the tires and could easily see the pressure. Worked flawlessly for over three years on my last one without a battery replacement - I am sure this is just as reliable.

110010,2,"My boyfriend purchased this and thought it was going to work great. the seller we purchased from was awesome, so do not think this review is a reflection of them. the Wrench itself worked good one time and the next time he tried to use it, it wouldnt work at all. He got about 5 mins of it, if that. Not happy and will be returning it for a refund."
119852,1,Bought this as a replacement for my car. Wipes rain away very clean and was super simple to install. Highly recommended!
86736,1,"I ordered this for my 1994 Ford Bronco 5.8 Liter. Here's the story:I have researched this product for quite some time now, about a year and a half to be exact. I have heard many naysayer reviews on this product specifically for this generation of bronco/f-150 claiming that it is not worth it due to either inadequate filtration of fine particles and or the &#34;fact&#34; that it draws in warmer air than the factory air box does due to not being enclosed. According to the critics this product WILL NOT increase horsepower, torque or fuel economy due to these factors.Contrary to what the critics said, I decided to give the cold air intake a go anyway. What I must say is after installation I IMMEDIATELY noticed an increased throttle response as opposed to the stock set-up. The truck is much more touchy now especially off of the line and seems to shift better than ever as well. I had no check engine lights or any other issues. It was a simple bolt on and go application.It is too early to tell whether or not this product increases my fuel economy or not. I will have to learn to ease off the gas a little bit more as it's very hard not to give in to the roaring sound of my exhaust and intake sound combined. I will definitely be sure to update in the future as to what I have gained/lost from this installation.NOTE: I actually received the wrong model intake. I ordered THIS 57-2542 kit and received the newer/revised 57-2543 generation II kit. The &#34;42&#34; kit is supposed to yield an additional 13+ HP and the &#34;43&#34; kit trails behind it supposedly at around an additional 9+ Horsepower. If you are set on supposedly eek'ing out the extra 4 Horsepower, make sure when your order arrives you are getting the 2542 kit and not the second gen. I found this out AFTER I already took the time to install this on my truck. I bit the bullet on it and decided to keep it none the less. Amazon issued me a small refund for the error and I can say that I am still just as satisfied as I would have been before. This is actually very confusing to me though however because I visited the K&N; site and they list the 1st Gen model number with the 2nd gen directions and 2nd gen Power gains... Which leads me to believe they do not make this 1st gen model any longer.Installation: I wish that I could say installation was a breeze but it was not. This was partly due to my rusted out air-box compartment area which required me to drill through a rotten bolt, etc. You obviously may not have this problem. Additionally, I found it easier to install this kit somewhat out of sequence of the provided directions. In one instance, they want you to attach included silicon hoses to the throttle body and then attach the plastic tubing to the hoses. I found this to be impossible as the fit is extremely TIGHT. It is better to install the hoses first to the tubing and THEN to the engines throttle body. Additionally, it guides you to install the heat shield portion included in the kit, uninstall it after you mark hole placement and then drill, then re-install. I did not have to un-install it once it was installed. Why bother with the extra step if you don't need to take it?Finally, it gives directions for vehicles equipped both with and without AC. This was a bit of a problem for me because my vehicle DID have an AC compressor at one point because it was equipped with AC factory but no longer does as the compressor seized and I simply replaced it with an aftermarket idler or &#34;dummy&#34; pulley. I was not able to find one of the 3 included mounting brackets to fit with my set-up. BUT, it ISN'T necessary. This thing is held on firmly at the throttle body. I believe it's K&N;'s included insurance policy should a user not tighten it down enough with the provided clamps and the thing goes shooting off into the pulleys and fan, etc. Just make sure it's nice and snug if you run into a similar issue. I have not had any issues with this at all.Overall:Pros/Reasons to buy:Increased throttle responseLooks amazing, gives the engine bay a much cleaner more aggressive appearance.Sounds great, love the subtle &#34;whoosh&#34; it makes when you press the gas.UTILIZES factory fresh air inlet through the front grill. I wasn't sure if it did or not, maybe this is exclusive to the newer gen 2's and why they changed it. I was concerned I wasn't going to have a source of cold/fresh air coming in any longer but this is a non-issue. This is why the instructions advise you to install the shield, remove, drill, re-install because the factory air inlet bolts onto the shield to keep it into place. GREAT!My number one PRO is the fact that I now have much more space to work under the hood. I no longer have to disconnect the rubber breather hose to reach down and change oil filters. This system re-routes the hose with a provided silicon hose that will need to be trimmed to fit just right. Anything that makes it easier to work under the hood of a near 20 year old truck is a miracle from above, LOL. additionally there is easier access in and around the fan shroud, etc.Cons: None at all. - Do what makes you happy, if it's on your mind get it, you won't be disappointed. I only wish I did this a year ago. My 20 year old engine now feels like it just gained back half of it's life. This is not a it's all in my head improvement either... If you want an in your head throttle response/increased horsepower and torque &#34;improvement&#34; go buy yourself an octane booster or switch to premium gas.Hope this helps!"

36071,1,Good replacement battery for UPS. Did test it in UPS giving enough time to charge up (overnight) & by unplugging the UPS to simulate power loss & with stop watch tested duration of power to computer & LCD monitor.

53166,2,"I track my mileage at every fuel up.FYI I drive a 2007 Mazda3 2.4 Liter engine with about 40,000 miles. It's ranked at 32mpg HWY and 25mpg City.at two tanks before oil change I got about 29 mpg.after oil change, air filter change, I had two tanks fuel up, I got about 30mpg.then I added the Red Line fuel cleaner, plus the Tufoil engine treatment. Here is the result at following fuel ups - 30mpg, 29mpg, 29mpg, 28.5 mpg, 30 mpg.Not much better at all, not as much as a regular oil and filter change.In my opinion, save yourself $10 and put that toward a oil change. I rank it so low because it actually advertises better fuel economy. I would not know if it does clean the fuel lines, but I know it certainly didn't help with the MPG.EDIT:my mistake, it's 2.3 liter engine.in response to the first comment:this is copy and paste from the product pageProduct FeaturesFuel injector cleanerCleans pollution control valveReduces octane requirementsRaises fuel economyProtects the fuel system from rustit clearly advertises ""raises fuel economy""which it clearly did not do to my car."

166211,1,"Nicely made. Really heavy duty. It's heavy as hell, as a matter of fact. I used it a couple times with no lubrication, then reading the instructions, they recommended a light oil, not motor oil. I applied PB blaster (great stuff if you've never used it) and it made the jack work so much smoother. Using this jack is so much easier than a floor jack if you have a lifted truck. If you have a 4 wheel drive and you like to work on it yourself, you need this jack."
74533,0,"I bought these for my Accord 99 and when trying to put them into the filter housing, neither of them would fit nicely, I had to squeeze it in there which bent the corners a bit, leaving a small opening on the side. Looks cheap, but does what is supposed to."
175621,0,"Certainly several of the key elements that became the mess that was the 2000 General Election in Florida are encapsulated in this bumper sticker: ""Don't Blame Me - I voted for Gore . . . I Think."" You have the reminder that more people voted for Al Gore than for George W. Bush (not that it helped Gore any more than it helped Andrew Jackson and Grover Cleveland when they won the popular vote but lost the White House based on the electoral college count). Actually the ""Don't Blame Me - I vote for (the other guy)"" has been a standard bumper sticker after every general election for as long as I can remember; you just put the name of the loser in the blank. But it is the ""I Think"" addition that reminds us all about the infamous butterfly ballot.The problem was that many claimed voters in Palm Beach County had accidentally voted for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan when they thought they were voting for Al Gore on what became known as the ""butterfly ballot."" The Democrats were listed second in the left-hand column, but punching a hole in the second circle actually cast a vote for Buchanan, who was listed first in the right-hand column. Of course, voters who punched this second hole were ignoring a prominent arrow on the ballot showing which hole was to be punched. As one person trying to explain this mix actually wrote, this was "" because the design of the ballot neglected the effects of parallax due to the center row of holes being in a different plane than the two columns of printed names, and the ballot being viewed at an oblique angle.""When ""The Palm Beach Post"" reviewed the discarded ballots they found that 5,330 votes were cast for the strange cross-party combination of Gore and Buchanan, compared to only 1,631 for the combination of Bush and Buchanan. The irony was that the butterfly ballot was designed by Theresa Lapore (a Democrat) with the expressed intent of making it easier for seniors to read by providing larger print. In the end, if half of the votes for these double-cast ballots were split between the two candidates Florida and the election swing the other way. I hate to think that something weirder than this could happen in a future election, but I know better than to underestimate the ability of Fate.But with regards to this particular bumper sticker the interesting thing is: who would actually put one on their car? If you voted for Bush, then you would not want it. If you voted for Gore but did not live in Florida, then it would not make any sense. It would only make sense if you intended to vote for Gore, lived in Florida but then you would also have to have lived in Palm Beach County, and, most importantly, were willing to tell the world that you messed up your ballot and cost your candidate the election. True, that is a lot of power to have, but misusing it like that is not going to be a point of personal pride.But no matter who you voted for, it is rather unsettling to know that in America you have the right to vote, but there is no guarantee that your vote will be counted: there were thousands of discarded ballots across the country. Florida might have had the most, a point which is certainly debatable, but they did not have a monopoly on them."
121301,0,Meguir's Water Magnet drying towel. Used it today for the first time. Overall it was ok but I have used better ones. It may have helped had it been a bit larger. I drive a Toyota Camry and that isn't such a large vehicle. I was bit disappointed that it seemed to fill with water much more quickly than I had hoped. It was a good product but for the same money I prefer the blue waffle weave that I used previously.

122631,1,"I have installed 3 sets of these pads on sportbikes, and they have been great. They have always provided more friction than the OEM pads (on Honda CBRs and VTRs), as well as improved fade resistance. They lose minimal friction coefficient when cold, and seem to be unaffected by wet conditions. They are also very linear with lever pressure. I got 32,000 miles out of my last set with &#34;spirited riding&#34;. I cannot comment on rotor wear versus the OEM pads, but I have not noticed anything disconcerting."
175714,1,"Overall I must say that I am pleased with this visor. It secures at least ten of my CDs quite nicely, though I must admit it is difficult to comfortably fit more than the intended amount of CDs in there. Once you slide in ten CDs, you will have a bit of a difficult time adding more (maybe one or two, but good luck after that). It is already not a picnic getting a CD back in its slot with another 9 CDs, so try to stick with the intended quantity. But the good news is you don't have to worry about CDs flying out even if you get in a car wreck--not that I know from personal experience, but I'd put money on it. So while that is part of the reason I took a star from this product, the other reason is because the straps that go over your visor partially cover my visor mirror on my 2006 Honda Civic LX. I think someone else complained about that as while. Anyways, while I rarely, if ever use my visor mirror, it still gives me a nagging frustration. The only way I sort of alleviated this issue was to stretch one of the straps (couldn't do both) over to the small gap where the visor connects to the roof.So if you have a few CDs laying around, I wouldn't hesitate too much on giving this product a recommendation. But I don't recommend trying to change out CDs while driving... at least not if you plan on putting a CD back in the visor. For me--though I have probably twelve CDs in this visor organizer where I really shouldn't--changing out CDs is a two-handed operation. But hey, it gets the CDs up out of my center cupholders and console!"
115313,1,I have used all of the major brands of wax and this one is by far the best. It really brings out the shine on my black Grand Prix. It takes some work to get off but it lasts longer than your average wax. 2 or 3 coats really makes a difference as well.

86659,2,"My dad came home with a 4 pack of this product a couple of days ago. I'm literally obsessed with my car's cleanliness so I used it right away. It was easy to spray on, and produced that ""wet"" look. HOWEVER, the next day I looked at the tires and they didn't look wet at all. I DIDN'T EVEN DRIVE THE CAR and the product had already worn off! I thought maybe I had done something wrong, so I tried it on my other car (which has really dirty tires) and again they looked pretty clean at first. In fact, I sprayed it on twice just to make sure they were fully coated. The next day I looked at the car and the product had worn off. I will not be buying this ever again. I recommend NO TOUCH High Shine Tire Care because it works WAY BETTER than this product."

185324,2,I bought this because it was cheap to mount on the header of my 1969 Chevy C10 pickup after I installed a crate motor and did not have the original bracket. After a few Months (maybe 1500 miles) the back tab broke off of the bracket and almost left me stranded. I ended up replacing it with a more expensive solid aluminum bracket that mounts to the front of the head and now I have no problems.

152758,2,I bought this for my Mazda 6. The usage menu said it was for my car. Not even close. Of course you don't know this until you have the strut assy. already removed from the car. I had to reinstall the old assy. and order the correct part from the Mazda dealer.

I had thought it would come with one. I was unable to find one quickly and opted to purchase another water pump locally. It as with the origional one had a pressed on type, unlike the flange style I had recieved. I am sure it will be a good pump but cant use it if it doesnt have the pully. It didnt state that it does not come with the pump, how-ever, I should have called and researched further first."

5618,0,installed this muffler on my '06 Subaru Impreza 2.5i and it sounds great. not overly loud either. would definitely recommend to anyone! Update: about 2 years later the muffler cracked because it was completely rusted so it was replaced with a T904 which actually sounds better. don't think i'll be buying another flowmaster again.

They did let us return them, but we had to pay a 10% restocking fee, and had to take them to the UPS store and pay for shipping. The company was okay, but it wasn't the service I've come to expect from Amazon companies (of course, this wasn't Amazon, just a company that sells thru them.)"

112262,2,I used to think this helped get more gas mileage and I put it in all my cars. But I don't really believe that anymore and the last couple cars I haven't used it and they run real well anyway. I mean it hasn't hurt any of the cars I used it on. It's just that other people with the same kind of car were getting similar performance without it. And some of the recent articles I've read are somewhat skeptical about it's claims and I have no proof that it did anything but cost me money for not much benefit.

48385,2,"I have found this product to be inferior in every way. Loud. Slow to fill tires. Awkward placement of the on/off toggle. Short power chord. I could forgive all of these short comings however, if it could do just one thing; fill more that 10 tires without blowing a non replaceable internal fuse. The first time it blew B&D sent me a new one without question. The second time it blew they said since they already sent me a new one the first time, I would have to take this one it to an authorized repair facility and I would need an original receipt to do so. I can't find it (of course) so now I have a big orange paper weight. Read the other reviews, this appears to be a common problem. If you do buy this make sure you keep your receipt in a safe place. You will need it often."
178319,2,dont buy from amazon.com they get the anti-seize grease all over the sensitve sensor and into tiny hole- destroying the sensor. Call Bosch if you dont believe me. Bosch sends out or packages all there oxygen sensors with a clear plastic cap on sensor portion and a cap on the pigtail. I have no idea what amazon.com distribtuon/fullfillment is doing- someone is taking off the caps or they are buying in bulk and not putting them on...Happened twice... dont buy
49790,0,"No issues with the quality but it was my intention to purchase this blade to replace the rear wiper blade on my 1985 300zx. While this blade will fit the windshield, it will not fit the rear deck. For the rear deck you will need a Trico Exact Fit 19-2. Need a bit more specific data on collector cars. I eneded buying the 19-2 blade locally as it would have been impossible to have determined the correct part based on current information at Amazon.

138572,1,"I've used these thermometers for years and even given a few to friends and family who liked them. They're fairly easy to install. Be sure to clean the window first. Getting air bubbles out may take a couple of tries. Once its up it stays there but comes off when it's time. For us, that time is about 4 - 5 years. Sun, rain and snow eventually dull the plastic and attempts to clean it have only removed the lettering. We have one on a bathroom window and one on a kitchen window. It's reasonably accurate. This time of year (December) a quick glance tells me how heavy a jacket to wear. And when the sun's out and the thermometer reads over 70 degrees, well, that brings on a smile."
81038,1,"Bought all four for our Grand Prix and these things made the cars ride come alive again. It's funny though, experts recommend changing these every 50K miles but we changed ours at 200K. For the customers though, I really hope Amazon starts to sell them again because they have the best price and their shipping is always the best since nomrally it's free and super fast. Very easy to replace though. They might not align up perfect but all you need to do is get the top bolts on and then take a bar and twist it to where it needs to go. I'm not going to lie, the rear ones are a pain because there is not much room to work to get the bolts off but just take your time and you'll get it. I actually used an O-Ratchet which worked perfect for the limited space. If you are thinking about doing your struts and either buying the complete kit or the pieces and doing it yourself, save yourself the time, money and frustration and just by the kit because it's the only way to go!

90487,2,"Initially, I paid about $2.39 for this product and for the passenger side handle. It arrived quickly and was easy to install. I could not notice any major differences between this product and the original product. Even after installing on the passenger side, the door is difficult to open. It worked fine on the driver's side door until today, when I noticed difficulty opening the door. Eventually, the lever snapped off the handle. I am not thrilled to have to keep opening my door from the outside when exiting the vehicle. Now, my interior handle needs to be replaced for the second time in one and a half months."

172474,1,"I bought this shock to replace the stock KYB Gas shocks on my 2006 Isuzu D-Max Crew Cab pickup. As this is a US made shock, hence no Monroe-Matic Plus application for the Thai-built Isuzu exists online, I had to select it using Monroe's Shock Fitment chart using extended and compressed dimensions and end-types. The shock works very well, providing good damping with decent control whilst reducing vibration noise from the bed. It's slightly shorter than the standard shock, but the slightly increased pressure compensates nicely, giving a nice ride along with slightly better handling especially with aftermarket wheels.So far I am quite happy with them as they seem perfectly suited as a replacement shock."

151484,0,"This is a cheap product that does exactly what you'd hope. The material basically feels like the air bubble packing material that is often used to ship delicate objects, except it's painted silver. The problem is the outer edge is surrounded by something that feels suspiciously like paper. After six months of use in the windscreen, this stuff starts to disintegrate, leaving a white powder in my car. It's not a big deal, since the thing still works just fine. Just indicative of a low quality (but very cheap!) product.To put it another way, I'll probably buy another, unless I see something substantially better AND just as lightweight, which seems like it would be a challenging combination.Oh, one last thing: this product comes in two sizes. This one is the one for compact cars/small windscreens. For full size vehicles/trucks, you might want the bigger one. There is a photo of the back of the packaging, which says which size works with which car for all current and many past cars/trucks on this product page."
9096,1,"Per the manufacturer, all of the JNC660's manufactured AFTER May 2010 now have an AUTO CHARGE feature that allows for you to plug the unit into charge and not have to monitor the charging process.

Also, they only come with 2 flimsy strings to attach them to the seat, without any instructions, so after all my fighting and knotting, the ties lasted about a week before they busted. And the final kicker... I saw the exact same seat covers at Walmart last week for a few bucks cheaper than what I paid thru Amazon. Live & learn!"
143865,0,"Sylvania tries to compensate for the transitoriness of these bulbs by saying that lights can dim 20% over time and that light bulbs should be changed every year. Unlike regular 3000K halogen that may, but more likely may not, dim 20% over a year, Sylvania light bulbs dim 100% over a year (or less) - the real reason why you should change your light bulbs every year. Yes, as many have pointed out, these bulbs do not last very long and usually burn out within a year. Even on the bar chart comparing different light bulbs, Sylvania only put one bar for these, but 5 for standard 3000K halogens.Also, don't be fooled my Sylvania's website description of this item. Sylvania says that these are the ""whitest and brightest,"" even though these lights are bright, they certainly are neither the brightest in the halogen class nor the whitest. In fact, these bulbs aren't white at all. The color temperature is rated at 4000K, but appears to be 3500K, slightly above the stock halogen lights of most halogen headlights (3000K).Other than that, it's a nice little upgrade on my 2001 Accord, and has improved visibility when I'm driving at night."

138674,1,Originally I had put a Summit fuel Pump in my 68 Chevelle; It was so loud you could hear it over a punched out 60 over 396 with 10.5:1 compression and the largest hydraulic cam you came buy with dual series 44 Flowmasters. I replaced that fuel pump with The Holley Red low pressure fuel pump which was a direct fit. The Holley Red was only 25% as noisy; it is still louder then I would like but at least you can't hear it while the motor is running.
19263,0,"OK, if you don't have much or want a TINY holder, but not enough for what I needed in my patrol car. It truly is just too small for what I needed and I think for the ""average"" person also.

84279,1,"Short version: Do not hesitate to buy this product.Long version: The tech who replaced the rear brake pads on my car a few years ago cross-threaded the caliper guide pins when he was re-installing them. When I changed the pads, I could not get the pins back in. It was then that I noticed that the male and female threads were damaged. Re-tapping the female threads and buying new pins did not help the situation. To complicate matters, the rear calipers on my car attach to the rear knuckle and not to a removable caliper mount. I was forced to find a way to make the caliper pins work. I came across Helicoils while doing an internet search and ordered them from Amazon.com. When you open the package, the first thing you notice is that the coils themselves seem too large for the thread you need. Don't worry about this, as the coils constrict when they are installed in the newly tapped hole. You will need to have a drill bit that is the EXACT size as stated in the package instructions. I needed a fairly large bit (13/32), so I drilled the hole larger in stages. A little oil on the drill bit helps. After drilling, you are ready to cut the new threads with the tap. The tap supplied is razor sharp and works great. Be sure to work slowly, keep the tap oiled and straight, and back the tap off every turn or so. After tapping is finished, the coil is installed with the supplied tool, the small tab broken off, and you are ready to reassemble your parts. My caliper pins threaded in and tightened down just like the damage to the original threads had never happened.The kit is a little pricey, but the tap and install tool are reusable, and 10 coils are included. The kit is thread specific, so make certain that you order the correctly sized kit. You can take your bolt to a hardware or auto parts store, and they can determine the threading if you are not sure.Please leave any questions as a comment, and I will try to help if I can."

3726,0,"Somewhere in my garage I have a much better windshield snow cover - made of a flexible nylon fabric with magnets on the top edge and a handy carrying sack. Somewhere.. I haven't seen it in two years.Oh well - being unable to find a replacement product in local stores I ordered this Axius product. I've had Axius windshield sun reflectors before and they were pretty good. This snow cover is essentially a polyethylene tarp that has been cut to a shape, with the edges of the door flaps folded over and sealed. As others have noted, the other edges are raw. You could probably do as well buying a polyethylene tarp at Home Depot and cutting it to size.But.. The weight of the Axius cover is heavier than that of a cheap tarp and the color is silver rather than blue. That counts for something. The suction cups? I threw them away - never used them on my other covers. I just close the door on the flaps and that works fine.It's worth what Amazon is charging for it, especially if you get a discount coupon code for it, and if you don't have to pay shipping.And, now that I have bought this, my old, ""good"" cover will make a miraculous reappearance. That will make it worthwhile."

62625,2,- took two weeks to receive in the mail.- about a 50% fit. small plastic tabs keeping this grille in place are not secure at all. i've been driving my truck with the grille in place for two weeks and it hasn't fallen out but i don't give it a chance of more than a few months before it falls out at some point.
153371,0,"First, the good: The creeper seems to be very well made. The plastic looks quite sturdy and it has a good heft to it. Looking it over it looks quite substantial.Now, the bad: The ad says that this creeper is 43 inches long. Well it is, but it also isn't. The creeper is 43 inches long from the outside of one wheel well to the outside of the other. However, the center part of the creeper, the place where you can actually lay your body, is only 36 3/8 inches long.I purchased this creeper because at 6'4"" my 35 inch long Craftsman left either my head or my fanny scraping the floor. I saw the 43 inches length mentioned in the ad and thought I'd found the answer. The Bone-ster is a bit longer than my Craftsman, but only 1 3/8 inch longer in measurement of the actual useable length.I'm glad the company brought out this product as it seems much, much better than the rest of the creepers out there. I wish, though, that they would bring out a tall man's version of this, something with at least 40 or 42 inches of actual, useable length. Would I pay another $50 or $60 for such a creeper? You better believe it.If you're 5'8"" or 5'9"" or even 6'1"", this is a fantastic creeper that is well worth the price. If you're 6'2"" or taller and if you're feeling your present creeper is too short, things are not really going to be better with the Bone-ster. Can I fit on it? Yes, just absolutely barely without a 1/4"" to spare. But it's a royal PITA to have to adjust myself just so. Another 4 or 6 inches of plastic would really help.So please understand what I'm saying: Very nice creeper, but not ideal for tall people. If Dale Adams ever brings out a 40 inch version (The Long Bone? The Femur?), it's going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread."

127694,0,"Just received this MS-4021B today. Went out to use it and it reads in .5 (1/2 lb) increments. so you could be 33.2 psi in one tire and 32.8 in another, and it would probably read an average 33. Description says ""Accurate to within 0.05 PSI"" and I am guilty for not reading past that. I certainly do not need 150 lb max, I need better resolution at normal auto tire pressures under 50-60 lbs. I can see as close as .5 lb readings with my old mechanical dial gauge. I will try the Michelin MN-12279 from Amazon, the one I almost bought first. It reads out in .1 lb increments. I will likely give this MS-4021B away, as I had to completely destroy the packaging to get to it, and I can't return it like that unless it happened to be defective."
174248,1,"I got this to replace a single antenna amplifier switch in my 2013 Roadtrek Motorhome. My sole interest was to have a 12 volt outlet that was using juice from the house batteries vs. the starting battery. I removed the old amplifier plate, simply hooked in the existing 12 volt clip on wires from the replaced amplifier to this new one with a 12 volt outlet....I even took it a bit further cause there was a separate A/B switch to switch between the roof antenna and a cable hookup and another small box that was a splitter. This one unit not only replaced 3 units, but allowed me to get more space in the AV cabinet (space is always at a premium in small motorhomes) and have a cleaner looking installation. I did not have to buy anything additional other than one of those female 2 sided cable connector that allowed me to simply use the existing cable behind the wall of the motorhome and I only had to fish it maybe 6 or 8 inches with a piece of wire hanger. Basically it took me longer to write this review than install the unit. Now I have a 12 volt house battery outlet for my CPAP machine and do not need to use the inverter all night...I could not understand why Roadtrek did not use this set up in the first place cause likely it is less costly and takes less installation labor than the original 3 separate unit set up that accomplishes precisely the same thing but excludes a very usable 12 volt outlet drawing from the house batteries. After a test it all worked perfectly. It is almost impossible to screw up this installation, but no doubt some will be successful achieving the impossible and they will be the ones who give this unit a one star review."

Happy the Glass Man is rich enough!Its small enough to fit on your key chain w/out being too obtrusive, I hang mine from the rear view mirror so it's handy should the need arise.I've seen the full size version & may pick one up as I would feel much more confident in it."
29229,1,Stayed on...no fading...looks good!Affordable & fast delivery.I would recommend this.Good way to support your team! & makes it easy to spot your car in a parking lot..lol
147618,1,"I just received it so have no put it to the test yet. However, it is well made and very easy to use. You can tell right off when you hold it in your hands that it is made to last. The key feature, the pliers, are extremely useful. The other things I have yet to use but I am sure they will come in handy when the time comes. The knife isn't anything special but it isn't awful either. It should serve it's purpose well. I, like most others, carry a knife anyway so the fact the knife isn't fantastic isn't an issue. I am completely satisfied with my purchase."
137206,0,"It seems that this company must be a bit lacking in quality control. There is one nut welded on each mounting plate. This is because when installing it, there is no way to access this nut as it is placed inside of a square steel tube on your chassis. The nuts are welded on top of a pre-drilled hole in the plate. Both of the nuts were welded ever so slightly off of the hole making it necessary to actually thread through the side of the hole..... I don't have a thread cutting die and in the mean time I managed to completely mess up the thread on the bolt trying to get it blindly attached (before I realized the weld was off). I had to take it to a friend with thread cutting dies and the whole thing was a huge pain in the you know what.... I was so frustrated, I was about ready to drive off and haul my huge trailer around with just a single bolt in each side holding it to the chassis. This probably would have been very dangerous and luckily for me, my friend is more patient than I, so we finally managed to get all four bolts on. All this trouble aside, once all was said and done, the hitch receiver works great, I just hope Curt Manufacturing will work on their quality control."

It's by far the cheapest part of the compressor and by breaking off completely, it renders the whole compressor useless. I'm not sure I'd buy another Master Flow for this reason."

156475,1,"I like these wipers alot. They do their job as described and they do it better than the OEM blades. The only difference from the OEM blades is that the Bosch blades will miss the last 1/4 inch, which is fine with me because the center 19.5 inches are wiped by these blades quite well."
154287,1,I like the cherry scent that is not overpowering. It adds a gloss without too much shine or oily residue. A little goes a long way.
16207,0,"First and foremost THIS IS NOT FOR TOWING! This is not the fault of the product, so don't give it a low rating just because you can't misuse it.Installation is as easy as pie. Just remove your trucks (or other vehicle) ball hitch and shove this extension in. Then hook up your bike rack as usual and ta-da! All ready to go, no more bike not fitting or rubbing on the back of the spare tire!However I'm a bit suspicious of the quality of the piece. The weld around the two pieces that make up this extension are poorly done (a lot of splatter from whoever/whatever welded it). Yes it isn't holding or towing thousands of pounds, but I do expect a certain degree of quality.An effective product that works as advertised, just a bit concerned on the quality and how long it will hold up to being used and abused... only time will tell.Pros:Priced well for what it does.A simple fix for a very annoying problem (bike not fitting because the spare tire is in the way).Fits any standard hitch.Cons:Iffy weld.Provided bolt isn't stainless, so expect it to rust."
128173,0,This product works fine to read vehicle trouble codes. It will not read trouble codes for the ABS brake system. Firmware is available from the product makers website.
37881,0,I bought this because it's a reasonable price for neoprene seat covers. When they came in I really liked their feel and they were easy to install. But I discovered I only got the 2 seat covers and the console cover was missing. I contacted Amazon who promptly shipped me out a new set. I opened the box and again the console cover is missing.I've sent back both sets to Amazon for a refund and I'll be buying them from Coverking directly.
134587,0,I purchased a set of Bell Chrome Deer Warnings for my Fusion and a set of Black Bell Deer Warnings for my wife's Escape. The quality seems to be what I expected and they blend in with the grills on each vehicle. My only complaint is the strength of the adhesive on the products. I lost one of the Chrome Warnings at the car wash.
136931,0,I purchased these as a light weight alternative to the standard Kry+++++++ type lock which I hear can be picked with pens and easily twisted off. These come with one cylindrical key and seem to be of decent quality. They are definitely bigger than they look in the pics. I did find one weakness which I will not mention for the safety of all bikers but it would not be immediately obvious but it would be a simple break. Over all pretty good for a quick 5 min run in the store but I wouldn't leave my bike unattended for too long with only these to protect. They are pretty light weight which is a nice plus. I'd give a 3.5 but the option is not available.
174706,0,"I change my tires twice a year, summer to winter and back. It cost me $130 each time at my local Firestone, that's $260 a year!So I decided to do this on my own. Bought 4 steel rims from Tire Rack at $55 each, a one time purchase.My first attempt to remove the wheels was a fail, could not even nudge the nuts with my crossbar.I think mechanics for the sake of speed and quick turnaround just use their impact wrench quickly and at full force. They should use a torque wrench really.Also, winters here in the Northeast tend to cause the nuts to seize making it that much harder to removeI came here to Amazon and bought this 18"" breaker bar and also an Armstrong 1/2"" drive 17mm socket. voila! With a little elbow grease I was able to remove each nut.I made sure to spray a little bit of lubricant on each nut to make it easier to remove the next time. Hand tightened the nuts with the crossbar only so not to overtighten.The breaker bar itself is not a high craftmanship tool but for the price it does it's job, twice a year for me."
152133,1,They are soft and have great cushion. My mom was always tugging at her seat belt strap near her neck. Now she no longer is bothered by it. It fits snugly but still easily slides for adjustments. Perfect for what I wanted.
6538,1,I looked everywhere for these plugs. And they were so expensive. Finally found them here at a great price. Thanks.
94993,2,Both the Amazon and Bendix's websites said this would fit a 2005 Escape with 4 disc brakes. It did not. Ended up going to NAPA and their pads fit perfectly. This is the first time I've ever had problems. I've been using Bendix ceramics on all my cars ever since they came out. I don't know what went wrong.
145444,0,"Invited me to buy a product is the value of similarities cheap and also the image of the product, but I was expecting to have more quality and weight as well."
170612,0,"My first impression when putting on this helmet is its quality. The way shield moves, the padding, the way parts work and feel all says quality to me. Except for some of the vent levers nothing about this helmet is cheesy to me like some of the other brands.The paint is excellent as well and not likely to chip (I dropped my helmet when it rolled off my ST1300's seat. Even though it fell on to cement and rolled a few times it did not have a scratch on it. I did the same thing years ago with another helmet and it had horrible scratches and marks on it)The airflow through the helmet is worth mentioning too. My head stays cool in the hot summer months and with all the vents you can easily adjust the airflow to your liking.So why did I only give it 3 stars? Well a few reasons: Even with all the airflow options, the helmet fogs up very easily when its cold outside (didn't have the problem in the summer). The helmet is also very loud inside compared to my old helmets. You will need to wear ear plugs with this helmet as the wind noise will damage your hearing (surprising with all the padding it has that its so loud inside).Also, the way the padding is put together inside, I have been unable to find a way to route my Autocom audio systems headset wires through it (an easy task in my previous helmets).The final negative, is not really a negative about the helmet itself, but if/when you need accessories or replacement parts, be ready to spend a fortune for them as well as outrageous shipping costs if you get them from Shoei. The face mask optional accessory (to prevent fogging) will be needed for sure, but know that it will make it hard to wear sunglasses with your helmet as I like to do. Replacement shields are very expensive, but are also very good quality.I'm not sure if I'd buy another one. I haven't found one I like better yet and with the money I spent on this one I'm try to make it work. I'd certainly shop around and try on a lot more helmets before going with the Shoei again though (I did try on many before buying this one, but when you actually ride with a helmet the experience is different than trying it on in a shop)."

87161,1,"I was not satisfied with my OEM brake pads on my 2005 Honda Odyssey, or the replacement Duralast Golds that I purchased from Autozone. My wife drives the van and transports my kids, so I wanted better and more reliable braking performance. I performed a lot of on-line research before buying these Akebono pads (purchased front and rear set separately), and it paid off. I have done quite a few brake jobs in my time, and I have never had a set of pads seat so quickly and ramp up to full bite within a short drive. Braking is good, wet or dry, and the pads appear to be wearing well. I expect 60,000 miles or more before the next pad replacement. As a bonus, the Akebono pads actually do produce less brake dust, as advertised, and the dust is light in color. Honda ought to use these pads as OEM."
28286,2,"I was hoping to use only one hand to secure or release my sunglasses, but it doesn't work that way. The cover is not spring loaded, so when facing down on the visor it tends to open by itself. My sunglasses are not too big, but they don't fit well in this holder."
172929,1,I had standard bulbs and had difficulty seeing the sides of the road so I upgraded to these and they work really well both forward and side views. If you want more light on the sides these are worth the price.
48562,1,Has done the job so far. I have used it maybe 10 times so far and it worked well each time. Handy machine
15054,1,"The first one I got didn't work correctly, it never would configure itself properly (kept blinking the red light). After getting the first one replaced, it seems to work pretty well. Makes backing the truck in super easy, which the old tennis ball doesn't help with at all.Amazon is amazing in the return process though. They are very fast to ship replacements, and very graceful in the amount of time you have to return the old one. They provide an easy way of printing out a label too, the whole return process couldn't have been better."

Total was a three-day drive of 1200 miles, give or take.Bottom line, the straps worked perfectly, with one exception. The snap-lock on one of the hooks bent a bit on the trailer tie-down point and had to be forcefully pushed back to release the hook, rather than gentle pressure with the thumb. (That's why it's down one star.)Some of the straps required slight (1-notch on the rachet) tightening after initial use, but that's to be expected with new straps.Overall it's a good set, and I'd definitely recommend them."

157026,0,"I purchased these in the spring and they are great. Quiet and worked well. Living in the Buffalo, NY area, it was only a matter of time that they would get tested in winter conditions. The storm yesterday was a perfect test. They immediately froze up and created an uncleared area in the center of my vision. At each traffic light that was red, I would wait until the wiper was up, turn the car off and reach out and bang the blade to clear the ice. It was back to not seeing within 3 minutes. Once I actually had to use an ice scraper to scrape the ice off the blade. I'm going back to traditional winter blades and will use these again in the spring."
15107,2,"This product could be a great aid in parking your car in your garage without hitting the back wall but, it does not work at distances closer than 1 foot. I need to bring the front bumper of my car to within 1 to 2 inches of the device. The Park-Zone turns red when I come closer than 12 inches. I had to resort to a block of wood that I feel as I come within 2 inches of the back wall. Bottom line: if you have more than 12 to 15 inches from your bumper to the back wall when your car in completely in the garage, the product is reliable. If you need to come closer than 12 inches, this product is not for you."
39682,0,"I did have this gauge for probably nearly 2 years before I got the dreaded ""L"" on it's display. This means it is probably a low, dead or malfunctioning lithium battery. Then you'll need to send it in for a ""free"" warranty repair. That is, if you can find Accutire's correct warranty address. The back of the gauge's packing had an address I had mailed it to and it was returned to me. i.e. 80 Little Falls Rd., Fairfield, NJ is an INCORRECT address OR at least my package was returned to me anyway. Check it out carefully. Heck... At what they sell for, it'd probably just be better to toss it and buy a new one for all the troubles & hassles."

139671,1,"This product is well designed, but in my opinion it is overdesigned. First, I have no clue what item in this world needs 300 psi. My air tools I have only need 100 psi, bicycles around 40 psi, and even my air shocks on my vehicle need a maximum of 150 psi. My guess is that the manufacturer is trying to make a statement that the motor will not burn up when you perform normal inflation pressures (unlike my ex-$20 ""tin-monkey"" air compressor).Secondly, there is absolutely no reason why the manufacturer needed to install shock vibration feet on this unit (see ""blue feet"" in the picture). There is very little vibration to this unit, much lower than my ex-20 dollar tin monkey.Finally, the 12 volt receptacle. It's a gimmick because the reason why anyone buys this unit is to inflate tires, not to power your tv, vacuum or cell phone. I just wanted a unit that can inflate my tires and nothing else. I'm not too fond of the worklight, but I bet you a beer that the worklight will come in handy on that dark stormy night.I looked everywhere to find what size battery is in the unit. Apparently, the manufacturer has knowledgeable engineers that know battery technology, because amp-hours vary with the type of load. In their manual, they state that you can charge a 7 watt cell phone for 10 hours or you can run a 100 watt vacuum for 22 minutes. If you do the math, the battery is somewhere around 3 amp-hours for the vacuum and 6 amp-hours for the cell phone. The manufacturer did state that the compressor could run continuously for 40 minutes, which I believe is a better data point than the cell phone and the vacuum. I tend to believe the 40-minute statement, because of their level of detail they have in their manual.Bottom line: You get what you pay for. You can buy a $20 tin monkey and get less than half of the life of this unit or you can pay more and get a good quality product. My thought: I should have never bought the tin monkey."
158056,0,"I bought these lights thinking that when i put my plow truck in reverese that i will have more light.

28692,0,they are fitted to the car but for 111 dollors you would think they would have the factory holes so that they will stay in place... nope.. so as far as fitment goes they are cut to fit my car but they do not go all the way down bc those plugs hit it..
7080,0,"Go to the Hi-Lift web site ([...]) and look up the LR-200 LocRac Jack Mounting System. You'll see what you are really getting. I figured this out before I ordered and what I received is what I expected. Hopefully Amazon corrected the image by now - I reported it on 5/1/2010. As for the Loc-Rac, there are instructions on the back of the packaging, though they are very generic. It didn't mount right up to my 2009 Chevy Silverado Crew Cab 4x4. I had to add a 1.5"" spacer between the hinged part of the lock and the truck bed. The problem is that the bed of the truck is recessed halfway down the length of the bed where the hinged piece of the latch is supposed to mount. Adding a spacer wasn't hard, but I had to buy some 1.5"" slotted square tubing to make it work. Even though I only needed a 4"" piece of tubing, I had to spend $20 at a local home improvement store for a 48"" piece. I also had to purchase a few 5/16"" bolts and nuts to mount the square tubing, but that cost only $2.00. Lastly, the lock they send with the package looks like a lock you would find on cheap luggage. Deciding not to protect a $70+ jack with a 70 cent lock, I went to a local auto parts store and purchased a coupler lock (used for trailers) for $15.00, meaning my install cost was $37+tax, excluding the cost of the Loc-Rac. In case you are curious, a 60"" Hi-Lift will mount inside the bed of a 2009 Silverado Crew Cab short bed truck."
178330,0,"This is a polish, not an oil... recognize that first. I have used mink OIL for 30 with good results so when I got a new jacket I bought this product. I did a test patch behind the collar, and it worked fine. I came back to it a few hours later and did the whole jacket, rubbing it in well. Then a week later I pulled the (black) jacket out of the closet and was horrified to see that it looked like it had a white-wash all over it. Obviously something went wrong. I went back and scoured the can to see what if anything I could learn and sure enough in the tiny print directions it states this is a polish and must be BUFFED OFF. So, just as you would imagine with a car that had been waxed and left sitting for a week...it took major elbow grease to buff off the polish. It DID come off, for the most part. I used a real mink OIL after that and it seemed to cover the few spots that didn't really buff out properly. If you buff off the product as the directions say, it works fine, but for me... rubbing in a mink OIL and you are finished works easier. FINDING mink oil, just OIL is a little harder."
1347,2,"The Good: Very fast shipping and well packaged. The Bad: As stated by other reviewers, the foam side seal is not included with this core as stated in the description and because it is an after market part it is thinner than the OEM one that is installed on my 93 Chevy x-cab truck. I went to local parts stores Advanced and Auto Zone and they had the same style as this one also with out foam seal. Had to go to local radiator repair shop to get OEM/AC Delco heater core that was full sized. The radiator shop said this would have worked for me it was just that it did not have as much surface area as the original and would reduce the amount of coolant in the engine a little bit. The AC Delco core did not include the foam seal either. I found it available from the local hardware store for about four dollars for a ten foot roll."
117302,2,the right stuff is by far my favorite type or RTV-ish material. this particular can just sucks though. the tip breaks off easily and i literally had a can of it do the shooting snake and unload everything inside directly on to my work bench after apparently pressing too hard. if you're reading this do yourself a favor and buy the caulking gun style version.

14139,2,"Ok, its time for me to rate this product. First of all I have a 2008 Nissan Frontier, and I live in the hot desert of Arizona, with the summer heat and sun beating down on my truck. On my vehicle the plastic trim which is right below my front windshield, is about 5'long and 4"" wide has become a very light gray in color and (spotty) all over, from the past 2 1/2 yrs of weather here. Now I used this product in the shade of my garage, and I did NOT apply it with a rag. I used my fingers and rubbed it into the plastic. On contract with the trim it turned very dark quickly, as I rubbed it in and continued to apply more product over and over. It took about half of the bottle to get the look I wanted. However I did noticed that even though the trim had turned back to black, I could still see a slight(spotty pattern) in the trim, and it could not be removed. It was something that was noticeable but still, I thought the product did very well. The product also bought a sheen back to the plastic trim which I was happy with, and in using the product I found that I did get a very slight oxidation from the trim on my hand and rag I used to wipe the trim down with after I finished applying the product. I have read a review that someone stated this product washed off, with rainfall, so I will have to see if that happens ,when the rains come again here. The product is a light milky white and I did not noticed any strong smell as I used it, so it does not seem to be laced with any heavy chemicals. I have rated this product with 4 stars, because too me 5 stars would have made the trim look like brand new. But I would give it a 4 1/2 stars if I could though, IF amazon's scoring system would let me.****************Update... after i did a wash at local car wash ,i did notice a little of the faded color to the plastic come back. not much but a little, i reapplied some more back to black and removed it, so far everything else with my plastic trim is ok.....Sep 13,2010UPDATE FEB 11 2011......all my trim i treated last year is back to its faded condition, and its been that way for awhile. this product offers only a temporary solution to faded trim....washing and more sun, gives the product no really lasting power..........."

63826,0,"Item mostly worked as described by web description and manufacturer. Found that the unit intermittently locks up and then has to re-link. Mode-01 Live data is very slow to update. Sometimes when you choose Live data mode by pressing button, unit does not respond immediately to command and often hangs while getting initial PID download from ECU-PCM. Specs says it supports enhanced data for PCM and TCM, however, it does not support ABS, SRS-Airbags, or any body\chassis codes as it comes. Manufacturer offers an $99.00 US firmware update to add US-Chrysler, Ford, and GM ABS, but there is currently no options for any Asian, or European ABS, SRS, chassis, etc. Called manufacturer and they advised that Honda, and Toyota ABS may come next, but no confirmed plans or date. There are no plans as per the manufacturer to add SRS or chassis\body code support. This is unacceptable in today's economy with the current technologies. These advanced functions used to be OEM dealer scan tool functions at a very high price, however, there is no excuse to not support these functions now. I.e. The Autel MaxiScan model JP701 supports Asian, and the US703 supports American, and the EU702 and FR704 for European and French makes all supporting advanced PCM, TCM, ABS, SRS, and possibly some chassis\body DTC's.I would suggest that the manufacturer of the 31xx series needs to re-evaluate the functional requirements for this entire line of scan tools and rectify some of these issues and lack of functionality or they run the risk of not being competitive in this economy."

186829,0,"I think this one fits the Honda Civic 1999 LX. I bought the 185-5001 version for the same car, but the connectors are not the same. This connectors looks like it would fit my car. Word to the wise, it's best to check what your connector look like before relying on the Amazon automotive parts compatibility system.The three starts is not for the quality of the product but for the poor parts compatibility check. I am not sure if it's the manufacture's fault or Amazon."
129797,2,"I ordered this item to use on among other vehicles a 2005 Ford F-150. On the F-150 I slid the smallest tube down the dipstick tube just like the instructions said and when I went to pull it back out it would not come. I pulled hard enough to risk breaking it off (which I did not want to do). I called the tech support line and the guy said ""Yeah, some vehicles have a flap or other similar item that it can catch on, just depends. You'll have to drop the oil pan to get it out"" No warnings, let alone a list of problem engines are in the enclosed manual. In case a waste of money. The manufacturer will not give me a refund and the return period has expired with Amazon so a total waste of my money."
183157,1,Just received and installed the air hog on my Chevy Malibu and instantly noticed a huge difference in acceleration and performance..i also own a honda civic with a K&n air filter and i can easily say that frams air hog is on par if not better than the K&n's highly recommend it to anyone and especially when you compare prices
120100,1,"I have a 2007 Dodge Caliber and the back windshield wiper size is hard to find. I looked on here and found one so I thought I would try it out. It has definately held up longer then my last windshield wiper (a cheap one from Auto Zone) but considering I dont use the back wipe that much and doesnt get alot of use, I thought it would have held up a bit better but maybe it dried out from not enough use."
60575,1,"Most awesome part ever bought! You know how hard it is to install and regular factory oem oil filter with no nut welded on the bottom??? It is a pain in my ass dealing with it and caused leaks not getting screwed on tighter and pressure causes the leaks. Since I bought the K&N, I have had no troubles what so ever and performs at its best at high rate of motor rpm. Easy install, easy un-install, great quality, great performance!!! A+++++"

After I spoke to customer service they where very nice, and explained to me for what they charged me and helped me very promptly solve my problem. Thank you Amazon.com, I appreciate your job. The item which I purchased is excellent and in the future I'm looking for more orders from you. I now know that I can believe you.Sincerely satisfy customer Judita"
187023,2,This is simply a poorly made product. Not worth the money at any price.
68194,0,The flange to the manifold needs to be modified. The holes are too close together. A few minutes with a Dremil tool to expand the holes got it to fit properly. Once the manifold end is bolted up the y-pipe flange is a little too high so there is some stress on the pipes once everything is bolted up. Hopefully nothing breaks because of it.

As it is now the seat cover moves slightly as you get in and out of the vehicle. So I have to constantly adjust the cover. The problem area is in the front, there is no straps in the front."
48767,1,I was looking for something a little better than those cheap compressors you get at discount stores. This fills the bill. I really like the option of A/C or battery. Plug this into the wall and it inflates things quite a bit faster than the units that plug into the car.

43280,2,"They sent my 2 orders together in one box and guess what,, one of the bottles leaked all over the inside of the box.

24416,0,"I own a 2005 VW Jetta. I ordered this because it claimed to fit my car, which I entered on Amazon as the ""new Jetta."" I had already purchased one at a local auto parts store that didn't fit my car because VW changed the body style of my car in that model year. I was disappointed when the ventshades arrived and I found them to be the old body style. My mistake for not contacting someone to verify the exact fit, but I would have appreciated the clarification by the manufacturer or distributor before I purchased. The company representative was easy to talk to when I called to set up my return, and I appreciate the refund promised. It just stinks to be out the shipping costs on both ends, which was not cheap."
138249,1,"Love that it doesn't require reaming or using glue on the plug. Does take a bit of force to get into the tire, but I'm very happy to have this kit with me on the road."
77794,1,"Blades perform well. However, on my Subaru legacy when I slide the clip into the end of the wiper arm, it doesn't click. And I can slide it back out of the arm without pushing any lever or anything. It's in there and it takes a little bit of force to slide it back out but it's not clipped in. So far no problems on the road, but it worries me, all other wiper blades I have used clearly click into the wiper arms and you have to push a tab to get them off."
98486,1,"You should definitely open the box, find the brush that the kit came with and then throw it away. Don't even think about using it. Go buy a soft brush from a craft store. I used hog bristle. Also preparation is key. I removed the brake shoes and used a wire brush on a drill to clean the calipers. Then I used an air compressor to blow off of the dust after wire brushing. After that I used the cleaner that was provided in the kit and sprayed generously and let all of the residual dust and grease drip off - then repeated. Once the calipers were dry, I masked off, using the provided tape, the bolts, rotor, brake shoe clips and grease point. Once that was completed, I painted the calipers with 5 light coats (without removing them from the car). Also note that I waited about 20 minutes between coats of paint. I recommend waiting 1 full day (24 hours) before you drive. The paint needs a sufficient about of time to completely dry. Just because it feels dry, doesn't mean that it actually is."
65043,0,"Not sure about this lock. It feels sturdy and works well, but it is beastly heavy and I am not certain it is really any different or better than other locks. A couple of the plastic bits fell off the first day I had it and that didn't make me feel too good about the product. Still, it locks the bike and it hasn't been stolen yet, so I guess it is ok."
74805,2,This part causes more engine miss fire than the cheap one. I finally reserved to the cheaper one. I regretted returned the same one back to Pepboy.
115083,1,Amazing the prices I find at Amazon. Just the part I needed at the best price I could find. Received it very quickly and fit perfect. Great way to buy if you can afford to wait a few days for your auto parts..
142855,1,"I have been having a problem with my 2006 Ford Expedition. I drive it daily during the week, but I park it on Saturday mornings and do not use it until Sunday night or Monday morning. But this type of 'down-time' shouldn't affect the battery at all! But I have had dead batteries a number of times and was forced to use a jumper between cars because my old B&D; jumper was not a 'smart' jumper and the internal battery was destroyed because it was plugged in. The reality is that my battery in the Ford was defective and was recently replaced, but having a battery pack for those occasions when I need it was important to me.After a lot of research, I bought this unit because my needs are for a quality product with automatic control so that the battery is not overcharged when plugged in. Before I had the main battery on the Expedition swapped, I used this unit probably 5 times to jump-start a dead battery in the Expedition. This unit easily cranked the big V8 on the first try. The unit is compact (for such power) and the cables and connectors are high quality.Maybe if you are a shop and need to use these types of units many times a day you will find a better unit. But for the average consumer looking for something that will last, never overcharge and has enough juice to handle heavy loads, this is the unit you need! Don't compromise just on price or, like me, you will be replacing it because it failed at the worst possible time!"
31098,0,"Bought this for a 1982 Yamaha 650 Seca. Fits properly, but wish it came pre-oiled like other K&N filters. The informational sheet says to use 3/4 of the oil packet, but following K&N's directions to oil every crease, I easily used the entire tube."

121041,2,"I was a Fix-A-Flat fan for two decades, having used it to repair motorcycle tires on two occasions when I would have been stranded otherwise (temporary fix until I could get to a shop), and once or twice on car tires (which I believe I continued to drive on for a long time). I carry a can in each of my vehicles at all times.However, the current design with the hose wrapped inside the cap (instead of draped down the side of the can like they used to do) cannot be trusted. I just tried to repair a very low tire on my car (about 11 psi). When I hooked into the valve I heard a loud hissing where the built-in hose connects to the the can, and it would neither inflate nor project the contents of the can. Instead it drenched my hand in the clear, chemical propellant. After 10 minutes of hand washing (very bad stuff), I got the other can from my motorcycle bag. Same thing with the hissing, except this time it sprayed the caustic foam all over the side of my car. At this point the tire had run completely flat, I had to immediately wash my car (this is January, to make matters worse) and shower, and I was stranded.So there we have it--two cans (purchased at different times and locations), two failures, both at the exact same part of the hose. Since the whole point is to use it for emergencies when there are no other options, I will not purchase this specific design again. Incidentally, I noticed Slime is running the exact same design--looks like the same company probably manufactures the hoses. How unfortunate--the product works quite well."

41120,2,"The antenna was well made, and came with a number of adaptors to fit multiple vehicles. I was using it on a toyota. The adaptor work well, however I had read other reviews that said that it loosened during driving. The antenna is heavy, and the signal was great from it. I went on a 200 mile trip, and when I checked it that evening, Yes, it had partially unscrewed, and had to be tightened down. I did not want to use lock tight because it should have been able to stay tightened on its own.Bottom line, I became more concerned that it would not tighten properly, and returned it. Beware because it is stainless steel, heavy, and will damage the vehicle if it fall off during travel."
43226,1,This has most everything you need for any season but is built for winter weather. Everyone should have one in every car they use.

115228,2,"The harness I received did not work and after some testing it seemed to be a bad relay which PIAA replaced; as soon as they were restocked, which took about three weeks, but that did not solve the problem. The second relay also seemed bad and after opening up the relay I learned that the 30 amp fuses were blown so I started to search for a short in the setup and learned that the wiring at the one end of the harness where it plugs go into the lamp plugs was reversed on one of the plugs, causing a short in the system. I could not remove the connector from the plugs to reverse them but was able to reverse the connection coming off the lamp which solved the problem. After explaining this to PIAA they did offer to have me return the harness in exchange for a new one but at this time I had already expended more time than I desired on this installation. The folks at PIAA were supportive."
102196,0,"We purchased this to keep our 2 Boxers safely in the back of our SUV on long trips. It installs using tension between the ceiling of the car and the floor of the cargo area. Unfortunately, mid-way through our first trip using this it decided to fall over. We have an all season floor-mat in the cargo area and I think it shifted slightly, releasing the tension on the barrier and allowing the barrier to come loose. Needless to say, this created quite a hazard when the barrier toppled over onto our dogs. We immediately had to pull over and fix it. The dogs were freaked out and we were too. To prevent this problem, we wrapped bungee cords around the barrier and around the posts of the rear headrests. This firmly secured the barrier so that it could not come loose or fall. We kept the barrier in place for over a year with that arrangement and it worked fine. My only complaint is that it did occasionally rattle and it left a slight impression in the roof of the vehicle."
120115,1,"It lasts the longest and when the price is low enough (say $7 a piece) on Amazon I buy 6 at a time. That beats wal-mart, kmart, autoparts and garage prices hands down and when buying so many you get free shipping here on Amazon.Shop smart, plan ahead and save money!This fits PERFECTLY on the driver's side wiper arm for the Subaru Impreza Outback Sport."
184741,0,"This sway bar link kit is pretty heavy duty and has improved the ride on my 2005 chrysler town and country. I was unsure if the Kit included 1 or 2 links. I was hoping for $40 dollars that it included two, but alas it is only 1. Just wanted to let others know this, since I couldn't tell from other reviews or product description. Guess I'll have to order another one. Seems a bit spendy for just one link. Also, was a b*tch to get the old ones off. I ended up grinding off the old bolts, but very hard to get the grinder in the right place."
145648,0,I wish they had a picture of the other end of the plugs because not all Imprezas or Impreza Outbacks are consistent. I had to go to AutoZone & hold up the old wires to compare to three different boxes. Better not order a part unless you know it's going to fit. My car is a 97 Impreza L but it has some aspects of an Impreza Outback in terms of the ignition coil & wires. Like they just had a box of extra parts on one line but were a box short on the other line so the factory workers handed the box over ;)
135203,1,"Length:: 2:22 MinsThis video review was made by my husband.He purchased this on Amazon and is very easy to use and fast.He made this video review because there is too many people who say they cant get it to work, and its just too simple!"

51541,0,"I have the same complaints as others:1. The red lights don't stay on long enough after they are activated by motion.2. The adjustment ""heads"" don't move around nearly as much as they should to cover a two car application. I had to get crazy with the mounting to make this able to hit both cars. I have a high ceiling, and had it been a low ceiling, it would have been impossible to get the heads articulated in such a way to reach both cars. I should also add that I back in one car, and pull the other straight forward, so this complicated things.In the future, I would probably opt for two different single units for a two car application. If you have a large two car garage with separate doors, I have a really hard time thinking this will work, especially if you have a standard 8ft ceiling. I was only able to accomplish this due to my 10ft ceiling and the fact that my garage is incredibly narrow with a single door."
73962,1,Well made vest and it looks great. Make sure you know your size when ordering.
6727,0,"I bought these for my BMW 330I and the first time I was stuck in a snowstorm, I had a real hard time putting them on. I didn't practice before but thought it shouldn't be difficult. Realized I had to lay on the road to get the hook on the inner side of the tire to fasten.Now I carry a mat/Cardboard box with me in case I have to do it again on the road. Would have preferred a simpler system.Once they are on they work good."

10810,1,"Used this item to pump replacement oil into an F150 differential after a seal change. It did the job with minimal mess and without leaking or complaining, It's discharge tube is generous in length, and its supply tube (inside the container) is long enough to reach the bottom of most quart containers. Its cap has the correct thread to mate with those containers. I may never use it again, so I can't vouch for its durability, but its performance is excellent for the price."
73939,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."

171619,0,"I had a car cover of the same brand for 5 years. So this is my new car cover replacement.The cover does the job and fits nice.

You can easily see what type of car is under the cover and read the license plate too.I also hope it will stand up to the weather and last as long previous version."
1683,0,"I bought this to plug into my cigarette lighter and leave in place most of the time to power a laptop, rechargeable instruments, tools, etc. Even though it is sold as an inverter, the manual says not to use it while it is plugged into the lighter. I still leave it plugged in, and it works fine with my laptop, but the charger for one of the rechargeable instruments I leave plugged into it usually gives an indication that something funny is going on. The radio on it has a speaker the size of a nickel. That was disappointing, but if WW III starts while I am at work, it could be handy for receiving informational broadcasts. For my application, I probably should have bought a pure sine wave inverter, but I gambled on this. I am sure it will be handy at times, and I think there are applications where it would be perfect, but if you want to recharge electronics, drills, etc., I would get a pure sine wave inverter. Good luck. I hope this helps."

And, I don't know about you, but the people I drive past on the highway are usually at least 10 feet away. For the price of this plate compare to other Nissan logo plates, I am more than happy with it. It looks great on my new Nissan."
23148,1,I have used this brand product on numerous cars and pickups since I lived in snow country for many years. These floor mats fit the van perfectly. I would certainly recommend purchase of this item.
156954,0,"I wanted to try this blade based on it's reviews, but I didn't want to try it on the drivers side first (sounds weird but I'm particular about wiper blades so i bought my regular one for the drivers side & this one for the passenger to see how it did...this way if it sucked at least i can see properly out the drivers side...especially with winter I need to see!). It wipes fine but man - what a racket! it makes so much noise it reminded me of those big boat cars from the 80's and that BRRRRRRRT noise you'd get from those crappy wipers. If you can handle the noise you're probably fine. I can't though lol"
88177,2,All the negative reviews are correct. I installed this dipstick EXACTLY per instructions. It burned out during the first use. Amazon needs to drop this thing.
83320,2,"I used the jack 1 time to change my battery, it worked perfectly. I tried to use it to take my battery out in the winter and the whole hydraulics system was no longer working. I just barely threw it in the dumpster after trying one more time to jack my bike up. After carefully reviewing the instructions and disassembling and reassembling parts of it, it eventually broke in 3 places so i checked it. I would not buy a black widow piece of crap ever again."
79047,0,"I got one of these for the 2007-08 Honda Fit. The box says that is what I got, but the fit on the dash is pretty bad. It is clearly slightly too wide and can't ever be smoothed out all the way because of this. The reason I got it was to keep the car a bit cooler and reduce reflections, and it does that fine, but it is far from perfect. I give it a grudging 3 stars, as there is really no excuse for it to fit so poorly given that it supposedly matches my exact car model and year.P.S. I inherited one of these from the same company with a purchase of a 2001 Honda Insight (the real Insight, not the new huge one) and it fit excellently and was of a better quality. That one was from the original owner, and it is now about 10 years old and is still in great condition."
28589,0,"The product is great. It draws less than 0.2A when under no load. Very efficient for an inverter. The wattage display is a little offf but the voltage display is +/- .05 it seems. The 8AWG alligator clamps woun't hold the voltage on a big draw though, so you'll need some 4-6AWG wire with real terminal ends to run a compressor or 500W halogen bulb or something else with a high startup surge.For the price you can't beat it.Beware of Power Bright products though. What's nice is you'll always get a person on the phone right away. However, I needed to retun my first unit because it was defective and they make the customer pay for return shipping (which isn't cheap for a bulky product) when it was a manufacturer defect. Unfair policy to say the least..."
164293,2,"For the cost I was expecting a thicker heavier duty type of liner. Right now I have all weather floor mats covering the back, this seemed like a poor substitute. I'm sure this product is very durable, I just had a different expectation. Also, the edge nearest the door has a lip on it. Personally I didn't like this design and considered cutting it off thinking I would snag it on anything I was loading in the back. Decided for the price I shouldn't need to cut anything off. I do really like the hole for the seat belt attachments, that is plus but not enough to keep it."
174153,0,"The seller 'Limited Goods' Will not ship to a PO Box. This is a major inconvenience to the millions of Americans that use a PO Box for convenience and security.Update: As suggested by others I left a review of the seller. After leaving the review, the seller contacted me to try to resolve my issue. This motivated me to 'upgrade' my review of the seller.I have learned that it is NOT possible to edit the review of a seller. I was however, able to remove that review entirely. The fact that one cannot edit the review of a seller greatly diminishes the usefulness of leaving a review there.I have changed my two star rating to a three-star rating. I do appreciate the fact that the seller attempted to resolve my issue, however anyone that uses a PO Box for security and convenience may need to avoid this seller. The vast majority of Amazon sellers are able to ship to a PO box without any difficulty.I would discourage any Amazon seller from using only one shipping company. I have seen companies that solely rely on one shipping company find that when that shipper has a strike, they cannot ship their merchandise. This is because other shippers become overloaded, and they give priority to their EXISTING customers."

The plow will just simply float on top of the ice, as it scoops the snow. Even securing the blade to the plow receiver, with restraining straps, provided no help."
139104,0,Good for what it is . Basically it is a cheaper version of the Mr gasket 7668 3 & 4 speed automatic shifter. The Mr gasket is $76.00 on here which is like $96.00 everywhere else. You get what you buy

116490,0,I think the necklace is very pretty. Its very sparkly especially for the price! But i bought it to wear with a pendant and it seems to be maybe too much for the pendant or kinda take away from it a little. It would be nicer to maybe wear by itself. Its great for the price i paid!!
127148,0,"Schumacher SE-5212A Automatic Handheld BatteryMy old battery charger went bad after about 15 years and I went to Amazon to see what I could find to replace it. Well, after bouncing around the internet for an hour, I finally decided on the Schumacher SE-5212A, it had all the features my old one had, I especially liked the automatic shut off. You can leave your battery on the charger all year if you wanted to. The only thing I thought twice about was a couple reviews from folks who had had the handle come off. As smart as I am, I figured these reviews were old enough that any manufacturer would have been embarrassed and fixed that problem by now, wrong!! Well, when the handle came apart it fell on the cement floor. That charger is heavy and when it hit the floor, the transformer tried to come out of the bottom of the charger. I was going to keep it, fix the handle with a couple of screws, it was only bent on the bottom, but when I went to use it, it hummed like a harmonica, it had worked as quiet as a mouse until it fell. I was kind of angry at this point and called the customer service for the second time and they said send it to Brownsville TX, felt good, they were going to take care of it, little did I know then postage was on me, all $16.00. It's been three weeks and I haven't seen the charger, about time to make some phone calls.By the way, the first time I called customer service the charger was clicking off and on, customer service said it needed to be plugged direct into an outlet, don't use an extencsion cord. Well, that won't be a problem, next time I need to charge the car I'll just have my neighbor help me push my car up on the back porch, I got an outlet the there."
125188,0,this is neat but I wish the cable had a longer cord. and I would like a on and off switch
52397,2,"I got one of these as a Christmas present a few years ago. I am not technically inclined, but the ad made it seem like any idiot could do this no sweat. Well after about a week of freezing and laying in ridiculous positions, I got it installed. I had a mess of wires everywhere and there is not much room to work in my car. Maybe if I had a garage, or liked working on cars I would be telling a different story, but I don't. Well it worked well for a while and then my dash lights stopped working. It wasn't a fuse, and my mechanic said that electrical stuff can be expensive just to trouble shoot so I have been without dash lights for a while. Recently, I had to 'panic stop' to avoid hitting a black bear and my starter has stopped working ever since, in addition to all the other problems the sudden stop caused.I won't lie. I hate working on cars and I'm not good with them. I got this so I could have a warm car on cold mornings. That much was really nice. I wish I had a professional install this though. It was a headache, and honestly, I would not have gotten this if I knew it would be this much trouble. For car people this is probably no sweat. For someone who just wants their car to start remotely and doesn't want a hassle, I would think twice."
170897,1,The quality is good . I was disappointed with how the seat covers fitted on the head rest. They are snug but ripple at the neck. I would purchase these again.
129917,1,"At first I was apprehensive in getting this from Amazon because of some of the previous negative reviews, but I am glad that I went ahead with the purchase!The item worked great out of the box with no problems, no adjustments. My car uses 8.5 quarts of oil so the capacity on this is perfect for my needs.You want to be careful not to pump it too hard or you may damage it or break some seals which sounds like what others may have done. You can feel some resistance when you are pumping which is all you need....don't force it. :) You want to take your car out for a drive to warm the oil up as well and then use the largest tube that can fit down your dipstick.I didn't use it to 'pump' the oil out of the canister but just used the very handy pour spout.I have only used this once so far but look forward to many more uses without having to get under a car anymore!"
83733,0,For long term accuracy you will have to screw these to your RV. Or you can buy a carpenters level on Amazon and place it on the Floor of your RV to check it for level.
119806,1,"This replacement spark plug fulfills the requirements of numerous gasoline engines at a very reasonable price without having to buy a large quantity compared to local automotive parts dealers. It is an original Champion part, not a knock-off, and was delivered expeditiously."
185384,2,"Quality control on this is poor. Mine arrived from Amazon with a leaky connector and a mounting screw for the unit that was half out. I'm hoping I can fix the leak. I got a discount on the unit and paid about $100, so my opinion is that it's only moderately overpriced for the quality."
85904,2,"Price was right, fit the truck fine. But, broke after 6000 miles and left me stranded 3 hrs from my powerless house after hurricane Sandy. I was trying to acquire a generator. That was a rough few days. Either way, the mechanic was convinced I had a pulley issue but after exam I did not, just a faulty belt."
91045,1,Love the K&N air filters. can't beat them for the price a lifetime filter.I have them in all my vehicles.
181281,1,This stuff is really great. I've used it to cover the strongest smoke smells and raw onion/garlic smells and it works every time.
131654,0,"I really have to wrestle with this cover every time I place it on my scooter because of the tight elastic band. The cover itself is great, as it's thick and durable, but that elastic band is a pain in the ass. Also, it's too small to fit my Taotao 150cc scooter with a giant Bestem T-box trunk on the back. I went with another product instead: Pilot Automotive CC-6324 Silver X-Large Motorcycle Cover, which fits a 150cc scooter perfectly and no hassle getting the cover on!!"
29759,1,"Subsitute to the NGK B8EV plug, this is the best plug ever. I run it in a totally modified Kawasaki that will not run with any standard plug"
135874,0,Easy fitting with the brackets from my old Memphis fats screen. Less buffetting than the latter but more wind noise.
176632,1,"I have a 1972 muscle car that I was replacing the carpet in. I decided to go ahead and install Dynamat to see if what everyone was saying about this product was true. IT IS! I was amazed at how much difference it made. The floor does not get nearly as hot (I live in the South), and the noise level was siginifacantly quieter. Absolutely glad I installed Dyamat. Even if you had to pay full price for it, it would be worth it. Buying it through Amazon for much less is great."
102359,2,"I bought these item it workded fine for awhile and then I could not charge it backup. So I bought another one,Not these one had it for severly month and it is just great.Bad News Do Not Buy!"
126586,1,"Great product! Just took 5 minutes to install. The clip was quite easy to ""loosen"" by inserting a small flat bladescrewdriver on the backside of the ball joint of the strut. Put the screw driver head in the slot under the clip, wiggle back and forth and push the blade under the clip until the shaft of the screwdriver starts to pull the clip back. Do not remove the clip, put just enough of the screwdriver shaft to pull out each side of the clip to disengage it from the fixed ball stud. Repeat the process to install. If you go to far and remove the clip, new phrases of profanity will ensue. Mind you, this process was for a 2001 Suburban, it maybe different on other models."
107181,1,"Tuned my wrangler several weeks ago, and it has run beautifully. I feel this is the best way to do a tune-up and have no problems during the life of the product. It eliminates all potential problems with the electrical portion of the tune-up. Will definitely use the product again."
72854,0,"Caution. This item is listed as a valve cover set, but is really only for one valve cover. You would need two to change both valve cover gaskets on the V6 engine it fits. Somewhat disappointing."
152872,2,"We were excited to find a custom fit seat cover set for the aging seats in our Passat.The advertisement goes on and on about the fit. CAD designed just for your application.""designed to fit as well as original upholstery"" ""The Coverking fit rivals the seat's original upholstery""Well not quite!I have personally designed using CAD, and I believe I could have achieved a better fit using pattern paper.You know how these days there is: regular fit, relaxed fit, and then Loose fit. We must have got the relaxed and LOOSE fits.The seat bottom went on easily with a sort of relaxed fit and actually doesn't look too bad.The seat backs, well they FELL on. I think I could easily put 1-2"" of foam between the seat and the cover on the side that your back is against, and 2-3"" of foam between the back of the seat and the cover.The vertical fit is OK; it's the around fit that is just TOO loose. It's like they got the inseam right but the seat back needs to fatten up quite a bit. The look is just like baggy pants.""The custom cover is tested for precise fit and durability.""Somebody was not looking. It is difficult to believe that the seat cover I received was tested and then approved for fit.The cutouts for the headrest posts, the lumbar support adjustment knobs, and the side air bags where positioned OK.The material appears to be good. There are NO reinforcements where the mounting straps attach to the covers. The workmanship seams average. The seams fold-in in places and bulge in others. If the fit allowed for any tension what so ever in the cover this may not be. The horizontal seams in the drivers side seat back don't seam to be horizontal, falling a little left to right as viewed through the windshield; the passenger side was OK.My wife thinks it is better than the cracks and splits. But for Premium Priced and CAD designed the covers are lacking.I could not, in good conscience, recommend this product and would not buy again."
90038,0,I must say I really liked this inverter from Whistler. It performed very well in daily use. I used in My street sweeper that I drive in NYC for 8 hour work days. It worked awesomely to power my desk radio and Hamilton Beach air purifier. I started using June 1st 2009 and it lasted until just after Christmas. I loved the whistle it gave if my battery was low however it was the same whistle that would announce its death followed by horrible electrical smoke and smell. I was going to attempt to submit a warranty request but I have since lost the inverter altogether. I would have put five stars if it never burnt out yet I won't put one star because I never found out the warranty experience. So it's three stars.10/31/10 An update: Around back in 5/2010 I found the inverter and sent the inverter back. It's under 2 or 3 year warranty. They sent a fixed or new one back super fast! Good company! Since it was purchased on Amazon I had all the proof of purchase I needed. Good experience overall.
171414,1,Purchased Fram because of the brand name. Been using Fram Filters in all of our vehicles and machinery for more than 20 years. Trusted name we can be confident with.
20821,1,I received the decal in a timely manner. It seems like when I am ready to take off my car it will come off easily without much effort.
148357,2,"We purchased this product and were very happy with the shipping time. While trying to put the cover on the trailer one of the tie down loops fell off. Once the cover was positioned on the trailer we tried to pull some slack out as instructed, with the back cross tie and it also came off. Upon inspection this cover is very poorly constructed. The spots where the straps are sewn include a very soft material connecting the strap to the cover. The material will not support the strap connected to it. The material the cover is made of seems overly light for the intended purpose of protecting a travel trailer from the winter weather. Another odd thing was the size of the cover. I have a 23 foot travel trailer so I ordered one to fit a 22 to 24 foot trailer. There was about 5 feet of extra length in the cover and with all the straps falling off no way to tie the cover down.I returned the product to Amazon as unusable/defective."
103587,1,Very handy and sturdy. Easily support my 190lbs weight. No shaking at all. Would buy another one to use outdoors.
59540,1,"We were looking for a different hose than this, but this hose looked to be in excellent condition - straight from the AC Delco factory, new as expected. I'm sure if it was actually the part we needed, that it would have been perfect."
62890,1,"This is the same filter you can get at big box stores, works great and fits in my 1999 Mazda 626."
98998,0,"It seems sturdy, but was too short for a Jeep Cherokee, not a lil short but alot short!!! I am sure not ordering another to cover the last 12 inches, I will use some other type of cheap material. This is my sons car. Easy to replace and install, I read a review that said it took a couple 20 minutes total, try 2 hrs total!! It came kinda wrinkled up, there are some spots impossible to get the wrikles out of. But for 50$ He won't have old liner hanging down with pins in it and glue dust flying around."
55182,2,"UPDATE 1/11/2012: The alternator has already quit working. I had it tested locally and they said the Voltage Regulator is bad on it. Also realized that there is NO WARRANTY on this part, they use that two year roadside assistance warranty as a distraction, which is deceptive IMO. Called the 800 number for tech support and they went to voicemail and called back an hour later, but were useless.First, Amazon has very fast fulfillment so I received the alternator very quickly! I have Amazon Prime so I paid 3.99 and got it overnighted and had it the next day! It has a great warranty, including roadside assistance reimbursement if the product fails, so they must be confident in the quality. I will follow up on the review in a few months since the Alternator has only been on the car for one day. I saved a lot of money buying this versus the local auto stores which were 60-90 dollars more!"
146796,0,When secured in the receiver the 4 pin harness will not reach the outlet on my 2010 Ram quad cab big horn. Had to buy an extension otherwise it looks great.
18178,1,"I got these for my cbr600 I put them on its a no brainer to install just takes some time, my bike looks a million times better!"
93243,0,Does not fit my 2007 Murano with factory roof rack. Probably won't fit any car with cross braces that are not full forward and full back (my middle bar sits back some due to the sunroof.
170538,2,"This product was broken out of the box as it wouldn't charge and just produced an endless series of annoying beeps. I see from other reviews and many of them don't work out of the box. I would avoid this product since so many never work right, I would wonder how long it would last even if it did work. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing as I could have saved myself the hassle of returning it. I have always thought of Black and Decker as being a decent brand but I guess they've slipped into being just a hollow brand for cheap imports these days, too bad."
31014,2,Very difficult to return. They had a 15% restocking fee and I had to pay to return the product so I kept it. Won't be buying from K&N again.
59500,1,"We live where cold winters are expected and three-day power outages too common. Many residents have gasoline, propane, or diesel standby generators. We don't. Our radiant heating system relies on electricity for an oil furnace and water circulation, and it is nice to have refrigerator, TV and computers working. Some items may be sensitive to non-sine wave power.Our Toyota Prius has a 202 volt ""traction"" battery as well as a 12-volt auxiliary battery that is kept charged by a DC-DC converter. The traction battery is kept charged by the internal combustion engine (ICE) optimized for such use. At rest (assuming the power switch is on) the computer monitors the state of charge (SOC) and other parameters, running the ICE to keep the traction battery charged to a satisfactory level (40 - 80%).At present the inverter is in the Prius' cargo area hard-wired to the auxiliary battery terminals. There is a 120 amp fusible link in the Prius' circuit to the DC-DC converter, so it is advisable to limit current to the inverter to less than that. There is a 100-amp fusible link in the positive cable to the inverter but I plan to substitute a DC breaker and polarized plug-socket disconnect. In operation the car and inverter are turned on, and a heavy extension cord connected to the home heating system circuit though a switch that disconnects grid power to just that system (otherwise hardwired to the grid). Other appliances are connected via extension cords. In addition to making sure that total connected label wattage is below 1,000, AC amperage draw is sometimes monitored with an inline meter (keep below 8.5). The Prius is in our garage with an exhaust hose to the outside away from windows and doors (and we have a CO2 monitor in our living area). The ICE goes on to maintain SOC and at least one internal temperature, and we stay warm, entertained, and on-line! To prove it could be done, we have used the inverter to power an electric weed whacker along our private road! This set-up won't run anything requiring 220v (water well, electric range, dishwasher, etc.) nor typical laser printers, microwave ovens, etc."
24646,1,Very good company to work with. Quick shipping with items as described. I would highly recommend this product to others!!I am very happy with the way these lights perform. They light the road in front of me and also are great for lighting the sides of the road.
147562,0,"I finally bought the SOG paratool after sitting on the sidelines for more than 5 years. Each time I handled a paratool in a store, I was struck by how awkward (if not dangerous) its design seemed. In the end, I bought one because Amazon had it for the right price (do NOT pay full price for this), and I was curious.The paratool has remained virtually unchanged since it was first introduced in the 1990s. Its central feature, a truly peculiar set of pliers that fold out from the handles without fully opening the handles, is something of a fossil among today's multitool offerings, as it was designed to provide smooth-handled pliers (the original Leatherman did not have comfortable handles). There are literally dozens of multitools from various makers that now have both comfortable handles and more normal pliers.It's difficult to describe the way in which the SOG paratool opens without using a video. So, I recommend that interested parties search youtube for examples. The critical thing to mention, however, is that the design results in uneven pressure on the pivot points of the pliers.This stool is made of stainless steel, which is great, and it's got a fine set of tools. It's also lightweight (less than 7 oz.), which is also great. However, there are some serious flaws: the tools don't lock, which was normal when the tool was introduced in the 1990s, but which is not acceptable today. Also, the complicated method of opening the pliers increases the chance of being pinched.The final verdict:This tool is a must for multitool collectors; it's unique and an interesting example of the ingenuity that has gone into the American multitool industry since it was begun by Leatherman. It's also an appropriate tool for those who want a lightweight, all-steel tool with a modest set of pliers with comfortable handles and decent set of blades and tools. It is also awkward to open and close--if not dangerous!--and the pliers are the weakest made by SOG (and perhaps the weakest ones produced by any maker).I should add one more thing: SOG allows the owner to modify the assemblage of tools of the paratool (as SOG does with all its high-end multitools)."
12212,1,Don't think this will replace a normal battery charger. Use it for what it's design for which is to maintain a good working battery. If your battery is dead to the point where the starter doesn't even click. This unit won't recharge your battery. My first one failed after about 7 years and it completely killed my battery. When the red and the green LED are both flashing and you have it properly connected. Take it off immediately. I'm giving it 4 stars because a failed unit also ruined a good battery.
184361,2,"While draining the oil from the drain pan, the yellow lid popped off and dumped half of the oil on me! The large yellow lid doesn't even seal properly so you are highly likely to spill oil almost no mater what you do. If there was a zero star option, the product would get it from me. Save yourself a lot of hassle and buy a higher rated product."
174097,1,This battery clip on is very handy when I need direct access to the battery.
129800,1,"The unit is built to last. The documentation is acceptable, but I took a star off for it. Other reviews cover the gaps, though, so I won't repeat those- if you get stuck, just look through comments to date. In my case I had the hose pushed too far down and I couldn't get the oil to flow. Once I lifted it half and inch, though, I cleared the oil in less than 5 minutes. Very reasonable. The unit seals up well for transport to the local oil recycler, and I'm happy I made the purchase. Due to the poor documentation, I haven't rushed to try the unit for bleeding brakes, etc. To the manufacturer: a picture is worth a thousand words. But if you can't get pictures, than DO THE THOUSAND WORDS. A leaflet doesn't cut it."
104507,2,ordered this what feels like a month ago and have yet to receive it. so yeah that's happening. if you dont have it don't sell it
145787,0,These bulbs arrived quickly ....field of Vision is great.....they just don't last very long ...... about 4-6 weeks ...we drive at night alot...... if you dont drive very littleat night they might last 4-6 monthsI would give up distance for a bulb that lasts longer
123694,1,"It held up fine and held a lot of luggage. As expected, it was hard to load, but it did the job."
144843,0,You get what you pay for. Cheap quality but the do work. I haven't used them long enough to know how long the last.
102869,0,"I mistakenly ordered this because it looks like the thing I set out to buy, namely the carpad itself with its raised edges to contain melted snow and dirt. In fact it's simply a cover to place over an existing carpad, and only useful if you have studded tires.I called the manufacturer and they told me this mistake has happened to several Amazon customers."
162594,1,Got these pads for a 2004 xc90 T6. The pads installed just fine with no problems and they don't squeal. Used these with brand new Zimmerman rotors. The pads do produce less dust than non ceramic pads but compared to the OEM pads that were on there I don't think they have the same stopping power. They just feel a touch softer. There isn't enough difference to junk these and spend $150 on something ele but next time I do a brake job I'll probably go a different route. However I think most people get these pads due to their low dust. I rated them 4 stars because they are low dust but I think for me I'd rather wash the wheels more often in exchange for some more stopping power.
71506,1,haven't used it yet. hoping it's as good as others say.only leaving these feedback to point out after I ordered it I saw it at wally world for $17.97.will give it 4 stars based on other reviews.
34042,2,"I used this product last winter, and liked it very much. This year, it no longer works. Don't buy it."
16056,2,"Not a perfect fit even though I double checked (2004 Grand Prix). I took out the old one which seemed better quality overall. When I tried to put in new one it was just about a half inch too wide. Took it out and compared to old filter and it was actually about 3/8"" wider. I ended up bending it to fit and that caused some pleats in the middle to pinch and expand. I rarely review my purchases, but I hate returning stuff so I will live with this filter, but it fails in both fit and finish compared to the old one."
160380,1,"I purchased a set for my husband last year and for my 1997 Toyota 4-runner this year and just installed them. I bought the black and cream front bucket seats only and they look wonderful. Very easy to install and in fact was easier than in my husbands car so not sure if the product has been redone. My drivers seat was becoming very worn looking and now looks like I have a new car. The set I bought last January for my husband still looks very nice. He hauls guys around a lot and if they get dirty, just wipe them off. I would highly recommend them."
186172,2,"I am very disappointed in this product. The cover I installed on the passenger side ripped at the seam as I was installing it and the driver's side seat cover is starting to tear on the seams, too. I was unable to get the passenger's side cover to work correctly on the seat so it is skewed. Every time I get out of the driver's side the cover slides with me. Clearly, these seat covers are not going to last very long. I would not recommend this product."
105371,1,I purchased this as an upgrade to the stock air filter large displacement motorcycle (113c.i.). It is a noticeable upgrade compared to the original air filter.
30894,1,"Had a K&N Air Filter on my 2004 Honda 599 (Hornet), and liked both the slight performance increase, and the sound the intake makes now. Well, after getting my 2006 VFR800 VTEC, I figured it couldn't hurt. It did not! It seems the bike runs a little smoother, and sound and performance are much better, especially after the second set of valves kick in at about 6400 RPM. And as said by ""Brock"", it does make more sense to not have to buy a new filter every time, plus I actually got it for less money than what Honda was charging for the OE filter."
3819,1,"I would definitely recommend a Delphi fuel pump, if you are in the market. I am very pleased with my purchase. I did A LOT of research before I ended up purchasing this pump. Now, my gas gauge actually reads the fuel level and does not keep bouncing around. All I had to do was remove the old fuel pump connector and splice the supplied Delphi one on to the harness. I would recommend soldering the wires together, but that is just my opinion. You can not beat the price and quality of this fuel pump and I would STRONGLY recommend it."
11646,1,I really like this product. It seems well built and charged my dead motorcycle battery up really quick. Now I use the quick disconnects and just leave my motorcycle plugged in when I'm not using it. This is the lazy mans device!!
182234,0,I have Bosch stainless steel appliances and thought that this would be the ultimate protection.There is nothing wrong with it but you might find a spray product in your local store that does just as well
159900,2,"Purchased a pair size 11 of Icon Field Armor boots 2 years ago.Pros: Looks, Icon styling, heal protection.Cons: Heavy, absolutely terrible for walking any distance in, poor quality.After a year of moderate use, about 10,000kms (6,000 miles) the top of the left boot wore through from the shifter. The material beside the rubber toe piece disintegrated. The screws holding the buckles come loose. Stitching in the tongue pulled out.The zippers are also poor quality. After a year of use the zippers became so weak they'd split open requiring fifteen minutes of frustraition getting them together again. Eventually just epoxy'd both zippers closed and resorted to lacing them up.Low boot height, poor ankle protection and weak zippers means this boot provides minimal protection if they manage to remain intact. Heel does seem protected fairly well.Can't recommend them for any reason. Save your money to put towards better boots."
88467,0,The .44 Magnum Shift Know is well made and looks great. The mounting adapter supplied with the knob would not stay tight on my 2011 Dodge Ram with Manual Transmission. The shift lever is tapered so that the set screws are only tight until the knob works its way up the shift lever. I made my own adapter using a M10x1.5 coupler nut and will see now that works. Pilot Motorsports need to offer threaded adapters for a custom and tight fit.
36167,1,"this inverter does wonders. On a road trip this past summer, we drove from colorado all the way out to new york city, with many stops in between. The whole time, we had the tv and ps2 hooked up thru the inverter, and never did we have any problems. played constantly, it was great. DEFINITELY BUY IT if you are looking for a way for your kids to have fun in the car, or wherever. WORTH EVERY LAST PENNY!"
10001,1,looked for ever for one it wasn't as big as i wanted but it will work. now just gotta find one that says nova customs

135992,1,"I've had these visors on my 2002 Ford Ranger for over a year now, and they've performed exactly as advertised through all seasons, cold, hot, wet, dry, etc. They fit perfectly, install in seconds, and have been very durable. I highly recommend them."
100414,2,well this was supposed to be for my truck and when it came in it looked nothing like the picture and it came no where close to fitting my truck dash! it was to short and completely different than what they said i was getting... compared to the picture... i paid about 35 dollars for a piece of crap that doesnt work... thanks alot!
8443,2,I bought two of these - and they:1) don't stay in place2) it is hard for me to line up and drive directly over them3) the bump are pretty substantial to drive over (feels like I ran over an animal)Reasons why it doesn't work for me:1) drive a small front wheel drive car2) Wheels are small3) concrete floors are smooth and dustyoveral i feel like these either don't work or i am just using them wrong..
66004,1,"got the tip for my Toyota 09 matrix, the tip is of very high quality and looks great! seems very durable and heavy! i had to take all the clamps off to get it on the pipe and could only put 1 clamp back on with the two other screws on there without clamps cause it was a bit of a tight fit! but its holding very tightly and u could pull the whole exhaust system off with the tip attached! so its on there good enough! looks great!!!! i love it! amazon got it to me next day with prime 2 day shipping!"
104515,0,"Aug 2008:This is a pretty straightforward purchase: two Thule-brand bars of dimension 1.25"" x 0.75"" -- exactly what I needed to replace my old (ancient!) Terzo-brand bars that finally rusted out and gave way. Only 3 stars are awarded as I found the picture misleading: the end caps are NOT included, I'll have to buy these separately now. Had I known (or read the written description which omits mention of the caps) I would have sprung the extra $5 to get the caps included in my free shipping.Update, June 2012:Bars are still solid and going strong. My rack barely spends any time off the car so the bars are constantly exposed to weather. Price has increased significantly though in 4 years. Paid $53 in 2008."
43825,1,The performance is excellent for the price. Feature rich and easy to use. I have the envy of a neighbor who has a competitive unit in the same price range.
100637,1,"This filter is a direct replacement for an '05 BMW K1200R air filter, part number 13717372602. If you check on the parts match it will tell you that it will not fit. This is not the case. Go to the K&N filter cross reference site and you will find that it does indeed fit. And by the way, there is some power gain with this filter and you will be able to hear your intake, provided you have stock exhaust. This filter will not ""seal off"" if you ride in the rain, which I do frequently. Happy riding."
149962,1,A trailer harness kit. I couldnt find this harness in the stores around here anymore. I didnt feel like retrofitting a new harness on my new jeep and my trailer. For 11 bucks you cant go wrong.
121237,1,"I've always been a fervent believer in using the best parts in all the vehicles I own. K&N air filters are a smart choice for 3 reasons, performance/value/longevity. By paying a little more up front, you can save yourself alot of money on replacement filters if you plan on owning a vehicle for any extended period of time. Furthermore, i've always noticed slight improvements in throttle response, power, and fuel economy. The savings and performance improvements always justify an upgrade to a k&n filter for me."
107099,1,"To clear up others' reviews:1) This DOES charge BOTH NiMH and NiCad batteries. Don't believe me? Click on the picture of the charger -- a bigger picture will pop up and you can read the label for yourself.2) Why would you want this charger? Because it works with both AA and AAA batteries, and because it works with an input voltage of 100 to 240 volts -- Kodak's other charger only works with US current. If you're traveling internationally, you just need to get an adapter so this will physically fit into the socket -- no worries about voltage or Hz.3) If you're pining for the Kodak K1000, it's been discontinued, but Kodak sells a virtually identical model and it's available here at Amazon. Just type &quot;Kodak charger&quot; into the search box at the top left corner of the screen, and you'll see the new charger. It's the same price as the old charger and has the same features -- I have the old K1000, and I can't tell any difference between the old one and the new one.So, if you want a charger that charges AAA batteries and/or works internationally, get this one. If you want one that is a little quicker and comes with 4 AA batteries, get the other one."
44529,0,"These are not a perfect fit, but look pretty good and do the job. Next time I will order the actual OEM floormats, because these do not fit perfectly and slip a little. Nothing that makes driving difficult, but just not perfect. The color and quality are good, but if you are looking for the fit of the original mats that came with the car, these come close, but will not be perfect."
147029,0,"I was really just looking for real exhaust rated hi-temp gasket material which this for the most part works but isn't exactly what I was looking for. My main quarrel with this particular product on Amazon is how over-packaged this item is. It came in a box nearly 2x longer 1.5x wider and tall enough to pack 100 of these when it should have just came in a simple stiff envelope or something. I thought the shipping was drastically overpriced for a 2d item and now I know why.In this day in age, I think most people know the price of shipping isn't attached to the actual cost of shipping an item but in this case the seller feels inclined to spend every dime of the shipping charges on the box, stuffing and shipping charges which is extremely wasteful.As for the item, I would only use this for tail-pipe applications. This isn't for turbo or header gasket materials which is what I needed it for."
183528,1,"2006 Chevy Silverado CCSB 2500HD LBZ Z71 These parts wear out fast if you have bigger than stock tires and aftermarket wheel offsets make it worse. Moog quality is unsurpassed and I have never been disappointed by their products. A lifetime warranty makes it all better. Sure you can get parts at autozone, but you cant get moog and you cant get a better price than Amazon. I checked everywhere and even my Napa guy giving me the military, shop, large account, and buddy discount could not come close to the price on Amazon. Just wish I had ordered the Pitman arm puller at the same time, was $45 at said napa, which I returned after use. I was able to replace the Idle arm, Idle bracket, pitman arm and add the cognito kit all in my driveway on jackstands in less than 2 hours with hand tools only. Did not even have the correct size wrench for the pitman arm, a 12"" crescent got it done."
78148,2,"After years of using Rainex, Aquapel was recommended to me so I tried it. The order arrived quickly, and I was excited to use it as rain was in the forecast. I followed instructions perfectly, even washing, rinsing and drying my windshield first. It seemed to go on just as expected, although the amount was skimpy and it didn't seem to be quite enough to finish the passenger side of the windshield. The next day I was excited to get in my car in the rain, expecting great things. I looked at my windshied, staring in disbelief. It didn't look any different than before i had applied it! What a waste. I will go back to using Rainex."
106599,0,"This would be a good auto fan for you if you don't have air conditioning or it is broken. We bought this for the few times that we run into a store. We use a sunshade and leave the windows most of the way down. But we thought it would be good to plug in a fan for some extra ventilation. Unfortunately the lighter only works when the ignition is on so until - and if - I wire a new outlet, I can't use it. But for extra ventilation it's probably an ok product. A battery powered one would have been better in our personal case."
164936,1,Bought this for my 1998 ford ranger regular cab after lowering it 3 inches. These work perfectly at preventing metal to metal contact / body to frame contact. The stop is made from good quality polyurethane and so far it has held up very well.
37478,1,"Any alarm installer will tell you that the first thing a fairly proficient thief will do is to pop the trunk ( very easy to do once you put your mind to it) and pull the battery wire. That allows him to work comfortably in getting around the alarm without calling attention. Someone with a open trunk may even draw some sympathetic looks from bystanders.Well, if you are investing hundreds of dollars in a effective alarm system, it is not very intelligent not to spend a few bucks and get a stand alone battery.This also allows you to have a second hidden siren ( I have two) that keeps blasting after the thief has pulled the battery wire.He will realize he is up against a professional job and will move on to an easier steal 90% of the time.If you have a remote transmitter that will also mean the car owner is on its way.Here in Chicago where the second amendment blatantly ignored, and a law abiding citizen is prohibited from carrying a firearm for self defense, that means you will probably resort to throwing rocks at an armed criminal or wait for the police so that you can tell them how you lost your car after the thief is gone.Anyway the only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star rating is that the battery does not have any indicator or link that will let know how much charge it is holding."
25578,1,"Good product.Really tired of the 20-word-minimum thing - is it really necessary?, so: Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words."
84664,1,"This is a well made product that is a much less expensive alternative to buying a premade ramp system. For those reviewers stating the planks do not fit into the channel of the top plate, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! It specifically states that the planks are not to be inside of the channel but rather meet the small lip. This will make perfect sense when you see the product put together as it makes a very nice, smooth transition from the aluminum parts to the 2x8 boards I used for making these ramps. Having the boards inside the channel would leave a 3/16"" lip, not good for rolling heaving items with hard tires/wheels, ie. moving dollys. Overall I am pleased with this product and would recommend it it to anyone looking to save a few dollars."

180063,1,"I installed this on a 2006 Accord V6 in early 2010. In the 2 years/40k miles since then I have had no problems with it aside from the pain of getting back in to the wheel well to clean the filter about once a year. Install of the K and N was not too bad but you do need to jack the car up, remove the front driver side wheel and remove the plastic wheel well lining to get to it. Just make sure you do not break any of the little plastic fasteners that hold it in place.Removing the OEM intake system sucks. It is definitely not intended to come out and some serious finesse and twisting/pulling in just the right way is needed to get everything out. It took me about 3 hours to do the whole job but 2+ of that was disassembly and removal of the OEM. The K and N bolts right in to existing holes.Since this sits so low on the car, also make sure you use the drycharger that luckily came equipped in the box. This is sort of like a scotch guard for your filter and helps with any water or dirt that splashed up through any openings on to the filter.I noticed a much throatier sound from the car especially above about 4k RPM and a few more ponies. I usually drive my car for efficiency rather than performance though, but would say I picked up maybe .5 - 1 MPG which should help this pay for itself in the longer run."

188718,0,"Intro-----I bought my wife a car for her birthday this year. I live in the Las Vegas Desert and the sun really destroys a car here, as well as make the inside so HOT! -- This seemed to be the best option to truly keep the sun out.PROS----1. When you get over all the CONS, it really does work.2. It fits pretty well.CONS----1. Nothing fancy about it. My wife wanted something more stylish. Wasn't happy it at all.2. It's SO dang bulky...serious! - Even rolled up, it takes up so much room.----when all four of us are in the car, there's not much room for it. Has to be 'trunked'3. It's so HEAVY that the center sags - not all too much yet, but it does seem to be increasing with time.4. You nearly have to take the thing out of the car to roll it up (again, because it's so big and bulky)CONCLUSION----------How many different ways can I say it? It's just too bulky. I MUST mention, that bulk is what makes it so affective at reducing heat. Being that it fits the window pretty well, it works better than any other sunshade I've owned.The sad thing is that it's so inconvenient to use that sometimes you have to mentally 'overcome' the desire to not use it at all.Questions...1.)Would I buy it again knowing what I know now?Very tough question because it works GREAT keeping heat out...but NO - I would rather spend a few more hours researching to find something half as thick that packs away smaller. Even if that means the car will be hotter.2.)Is there anything that I would change to make this product better?Yes, so many things, but the main problem is the fact that it's so STIFF & THICK. It forces it to have to 'roll-up' for storage, instead of 'fold-upon-itself' like most sunshades do.3.)Anything else I should add?I think they should print some sort of design on the front. I would put up with the crap if it had an image I liked on the outside."

118333,0,"Bought this to restore a vintage razor blade. It left it looking brand new with a mirror polish. Such a small amount of polish is needed I'm sure this'll last me years. After using it on the razor, I've used it on skateboard trucks, knives, and brass decorations. It has worked great on all applications.Update: Once I was done using this polish, I stored it. About two months later I needed it again. I opened the container to find the cream had layer of yellow fluid on the surface and smelled strongly of ammonia. I tried mixing the liquid back into the cream but it did not mix. The cream now has the consistency of low viscosity goo and can't polish anymore. I emailed Blue Magic to get some answers but I never received a reply.Three stars because before it turned to goo, it worked flawlessly. More like 2.5 stars since I was only able to use about half."

154124,0,First let me say that I love Mothers reflections wax. Easy on and off and leaves a beautiful deep gloss. When I saw this addition to the reflections line recently I had to have it for my Torch Red Corvette. I now have to agree with a previous review that I found absolutely no difference before and after applying this product at all-- none. The mothers wax leaves such a nice shine there is no need for this product. Even beads water the same as before. Easy on and off product like the wax but will not use again.

It would have been nice if the piece that twists the band was a little further forward to help with shorter bands.

Fitting the bolts (I bought stainless steel SS-310 bolts to replace the stock carbon-steel bolts which come w/ the kit) through the frame of the car & the hitch/receiver involved (just me, a 1-person install) several hours of swearing & wishing I had a professional mechanic's tool set available to me (for some of the very tight spots to crank down large bolts/nuts with the typical large tool required to do so).Once installed, it does the job well."

The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
31148,0,"The installation was not easy although you would think it would be. The filters construction, the outer rubber sealing lip would not allow the air filter cover to close properly.

21186,0,"I purchased this after two cage riders ignored my horn and nearly flattened me. This horn would not have been any more effective. It is maybe as loud as the factory horn was. Additionally this horn is constructed of cheap, thin plastic. It does have a few positive aspects: It is inexpensive; I wouldn't buy one again but I don't regret dropping 10 bucks to try it out. Though it is only as loud as the factory horn that it replaces, it has better tonal quality. This was an easy install on my VTX1300R; maybe a ten minute replacement."
164567,0,"While these floormats are OK, they are not as high quality as the OEM mats that came with the car. The front mats in my era Passat (2002) have two holes near the rear or the mat that fit over pegs in the floor (to hold the mat in place). While these mats do have the holes, the hardware in the hole does not hold the mat in place. In the OEM mat, the hardware snaps onto the peg, but this doesn't happen in the replacement mat. The mats will start wandering around very soon as though they lacked the restraining system. I was able to remove the hardware from the OEM mats and swap it with the hardware on the replacement mats. The mats now stay where they should. The rear OEM mats also have pegs & holes (although the details are different than the front mats). The replacement mats lack these holes completely. The carpeting of the mat is also not as attractive as the OEM mats. While my comments have been mostly negative, these mats are less expensive than replacement OEM mats. With the modifications I made in the front mats they are now do a good job being a floor mat in my auto."

They use a different part than the Resistor Module used in older Impalas. The failure mode on these modules in that the Fan STAYS ON FULL BLAST, even with the key removed. You must pull the main 30 amp blower motor fuse under the hood. I bought a module at Advanced Auto and it blew in a month or so. In the meantime I came across information that indicated that dealerships always replace the motor at the same time as replacing a blown module. I was able to buy the blower and module for about the same price as I paid for the module alone at Advanced Auto. (AA did refund me for my blown module when they had none in stock).It seems that these modules fail in waves, eliminating available stock when winter sets in each year. Originally Autozone and others had no stock, while AA had some at a number of local stores. A month later Amazon was the only place I could find the module and the fan. Great deal Great price Free shipping took 4-5 days from texas."

133000,0,"I bought this to convert my ""009"" points distrubutor on an air-cooled VW vanagon. The kit comes with four or five different optical wheels, plus various brackets and things to fit a wide range of distributors. Unfortuantely, I only needed a couple of those parts (but obviously paid for all the rest, which went directly into the trash).The other problem with the fact that this thing is designed to work on a huge range of distributors, is that it may not work on any particular one perfectly.Initially, I had a very difficult time getting the optical wheel to slip down onto the distributor shaft--even with lubrication. I was worried I would break or deform the little plastic thing... When I finally pushed hard enough, it slipped all the way down and I couldn't get it back up. I ended up having to disassemble the distributor in order to try again.To make matters worse, the optical sensor won't fit in after the wheel has been installed, so it has to be guided down along with the wheel. In fact, there's really not enough room for the sensor at all. I had to grind about an eighth of an inch off of the circumference of the wheel so that it didn't rub on the mounting screw of the sensor. I also had to file some of the distributor cap down so that it wouldn't hit the top of the sensor.I did finally get it working though... It just wasn't very easy..."

I belive that will fit pefect for Tundras older model but not 2007 and newer. Tail gate on new Tundra is toller and thats why the extender is shorter. Second thing I did not like is kit which you have to buy for toyoya models. Kit packages comes without instructions for instalation. You have to think and figure out how to install it.

I used the entire can to treat my vehicle and followed all the package instructions. This stuff does have a somewhat pleasant lemon scent. Took about 5 days of running the blower fan full blast with the windows down during my daily commute to get the lemon scent from the stuff to subside to a tolerable level. However, after about 10 days after application, the mildew smell is back and now I have lemon scented mildew. Clearly the stuff didn't work. I wouldn't buy it again. It gets 2 stars only because the smell was decent."

184642,2,"The connectors to the distributor cap did not have a solid locked in feel to them as my old set did. The rubber seals the wire went into had a right angle connector, and the wires were straight wires that went through so you had to force through the right angle boot. It was tough to get the feeling that the connector was locked in tight. My old set was much nicer- the snap on part had a right angle built into the connector, so the connector was locked into the rubber boot already and snapped into the distributor nicely. These cables had a ""junky"" feel to them when installing. They did work when I finished the job, but I felt the design was poor."
138307,1,I looked at several seats trying to find one. The seat arrived quickly. In just a few minutes I had it installed and was off for a ride. My first thought was the seat is hard. The seat is very firm but conforms to my body while riding giving great comfort during long rides. The seat is wide giving plenty of room for sitting. the only reason I did not give it five stars is I think the back of the seat should come up straighter giving more lower back support. It is a nice seat though.

Same problem with the second shipment, and again I had to return it. The product/catalog number is correct per the label, but the ""Fit Verifier"" is wrong. Amazon was very good with both returns, and will refund my money."

The new blower plug location was a bit larger also (this was mentioned in a previous review).This plug has to be waterproofed,you will see why when you install yours.A little bit of silicon around the OEM rubber boot solved this issue.When I started the blower up initially it made a slight rubbing noise.Mind you I could have bumped it a tad installing it.Anyways it seems to have quieted itself down after a few miles and is working fine now.The original lasted 286,000km on my Jeep TJ and started to squeak.This one has a lifetime warranty and we'll see how long it lasts.I also replaced the resistor under the blower and that was ready to go also."

I have one that went bad just before the 3 year FREE replacement, which is very unusual with Optima batteries. The manufacturer won't honor warranty because Amazon is not an authorized distributor, they show a warranty link (bad advertizing), If you contact Amazon they say it's only good for 30 days. Terrible deal and have found it online for $20 cheaper, free shipping, and warrantied. Very disappointed with Amazon. BEWARE!!!"

97430,0,I've gone thru 4 pairs of these bulbs on my 2001 BMW 3 series. I typically would average 3 to 4 months of life per a bulb. Just glad the store I purchased them has a 1 year warranty. These bulbs have a bluish hue to them and do not match most HID/Xenon factory bulbs.
168416,1,"Great looking chrome peg mounts for my HD Sportster chrome engine guards, providing a restful position for the feet on long rides. I looked long and hard at the many types of engine guard peg mounts, and so glad I found these, which are clean and simple in looks, don't detract from the clean lines of the engine guards, and allow the pegs to fold up unobtrusively close to the engine guards. When I installed the Kuryakyn ISO-Stirrup mounts, in the forward peg positions of my H-D Sportster, I had an extra set of pegs, and putting them on the engine guards was a no-brainer."

169485,2,"First: False advertising. The packing implies it covers four doors, nowhere on the product description does it say it takes 2 sheets to cover one door. The product photo hides where it says this on the package.Second: It's a lot of money considering Ice & water shield (the kind used for roofing) has the same effect. How do I know? When I realized I'd been had on the packaging, I wasn't about to get ripped-off twice. I finished the back doors with Ice & Water shield, did a sound comparison. All four doors are the same size and have the same speakers, I faded back and forth, hearing no discernible difference.Conclusion: Save your cash, find a neighbor doing his roof and ask for the end scraps."
42341,0,"As this is only spray paint, I dont' want to knock it down too much, but the paint did stick well after proper surface prep. However, when painting outside, don't paint in the sun. The paint dries extreamly fast and if you don't make a complete coating while its still wet it will look more like camo. I painted the whole thing as a base coat, looked camo, then backed way up and did a very light dust coating to be sure to cover the entire surface at once so that it was all the same color. If you wan't to use this paint, buy extra for trial and error. I had to paint my item 2 times because the first time it was camo looking and I couldn't get a even finish. Also, the finish will not be extreamly smooth, so if your looking for a smooth black, buy something else."

146204,0,"The application worked but with some problems encounterd. The face of the previous pulley was angled slightly different which cased the preseent pulley not to spin and I ended destroying a brand new serpintine belt. It started smoking and melting due to the pulley not turning. After removing the washer that held the idler pulley it spun freely and has worked since then well, with the aid of an new serpintine belt(unexpected expense). The pulley itself is good. Just becareful that it spins freely prior to putting on the belt."

135657,0,"The on-line picture is decieving. It's only 4"" long and the wire grip is abut as big as an average persons thumb when clamped together (about 3/4""). Yes, I beleive such a tool has to be small to fit in tight spots but I have a Tahoe and it won't go around the wire/boot. It appears to me to be more suited for small engines (mower, 2-cycle, etc.) and small engine cars where the boot is smaller. It's a good design, it's a good idea, but it doesn't seem to work for larger applications - good for the smaller stuff."
106886,0,"I've had mixed results with this product MIG welding on an auto restoration project. When sprayed on very thinly, it worked OK in a few places, but the primer was so thin there that I'm not sure it would be doing its job of protecting the metal. In other cases, where the primer coat might have been a bit thicker, my MIG wire frequently just bounced off and would not strike an arc, even when the wire was cut to a sharp tip. Getting a consistent coat thickness is not easy because the paint is thick with copper particles.In yet other cases, I got lots of splatter when the primer was at the bottom of a hole for a plug weld, leading to some welds that did not penetrate at all. It might be possible to clean the primer out of plug weld holes with lacquer thinner on a Q-tip. Lots of work.Three stars is generous since I've stopped using this product. Perhaps you will have better luck in a different type of use. It has been positively reviewed on an auto restoration site."
56118,1,"I sent 2 pairs of these gloves to my son in Afghanistan. He is a mechanic and works out on the flightline every day. It is cold out there. He states these gloves are perfect for his needs. I sent two, because one of the other reviews said they wear out quickly. I am not sure if this is the case, but if it is, my son has another pair. The price is good and reasonable. Amazon shipped directly to my son's APO address. He received them about a week after I placed the order. He has no complaints and is very satisfied with the gloves. 5 stars for the gloves, and 5 stars to Amazon!! My son is 6'3"" with very large hands. The XL fits him perfectly."
33558,0,"Product description is a little off, it's says no cutting is required, but they don't come with any kind of precut slot for the head rest to go back in, so....they tell me to take a ""pencil"" and spread the material, needs a presewed slot for the headrest!"
136092,0,"This item is listed as a match for Chevrolet, which is true as long as you don't mind having the handle sitting on the floor of your car because none of the five handles provided ""most closely matches"" (per the package instructions).

103167,0,"I like the material and the pattern on the seat cover, it is perfect for my 86 Chevy pickup; however, the installation could be much better thought out. The seat cover itself would be much better designed if they took the material they used for the pocket across the front seat and used it as a cap on the seat back so that it would fit over the top of the seat back. The pocket on the front of the seat is pretty much useless."
42421,2,"I bought this junk about a year ago (unfortunately not from Amazon). I've used it for camping and inflating tires and blowup toys. Worked fine for about 6 months then the compressor just quit. Being a tool oriented kind of guy, I took it apart to see what was up. Come to find out, the ""piston ring"" that provides the seal for the compressor was only a cheap plastic washer, and had worn out already. After trying in vain to find replacement parts for this thing, I threw it away. Sad to see what B&D has become. I will never buy another of their products again."

The cardboard box this came in measures 53.5""x24.5""x12.5"", so I don't know how Thule came up with 54x25. (The 15"" height seems to be fairly accurate for the exterior) I can understand being off an inch due to interior vs exterior dimensions, but the exterior width is an inch less than what it says on the box.I'm taking dimensional photos to add to this listing, and I'll be returning this to Amazon."

The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."

110727,1,"I ordered the 17' x 6.4' Carpad because I live in the snowbelt of Northern Michigan and my one-car garage floor gets very wet from the snow, sand, and salt that falls from my Toyota Matrix each night, so I needed something to contain the water. My Carpad arrived 12/29/03. It is contained in a compact square box and is made of thick, high quality vinyl. It comes with four precut garden hose lengths which are inserted into the side pockets to provide the raised edge to contain the snowmelt. Hoses make sense since you can run a car over them without doing any damage. After reading the instructions, I unfolded the pad inside the house, uncurled the hoses, and left them overnight to warm and become pliable. Upon returning home from work 12/29/03, I left the car outside the garage (after drawing a chalk line on the garage floor to note where the tireguards should be installed on the Carpad) and went to work. Because my garage floor was already wet, I put down a cheap tarp first. Since the garage was cold (29F), I assembled the Carpad indoors. Why be uncomfortable? And it was a snap; took less than 15 minutes. The hoses slide in easily and it only takes a moment to cut off any excess, remove the PCV pipe at the end, and reinsert it. Contrary to the instructions, you don't need another person to hold the other end of the Carpad while the hose is being inserted. I just sprayed the inside of each hose pocket with a vinyl cleaner for lubrication and the hose easily slid in. I did use duct tape at the corners where the hoses meet. After completing three sides, I picked up the Carpad and carried it into the garage. Because the hoses are pliable, the assembled Carpad was very easy to move. Once it was positioned where I wanted it, I installed the &quot;tireguards&quot; (heavier plastic strips with adhesive on one side, placed over the welded seam of the edges the car tires cross), then slid the hose in the last pocket and presto! The job was done. Opened the garage door, drove the car in, and that was that. The next morning I saw that the Carpad was doing its job, containing the snow and other gunk that had melted from the car so it didn't spread throughout the garage. It took maybe five minutes to mop up the water. In the spring I plan to remove the hoses, fold up the pad, and store it until next winter. The Carpad does exactly what it is advertised to do, is easy to install, and best of all, it's made in America. I would highly recommend it. By the way, Amazon's price is sixty bucks cheaper than other Internet sellers."

56540,1,"The Quick Strut was not too difficult to install on my 1998 Camry. The Quick Strut comes completely assembled and ready to install. Since I already had experience doing the front struts the rears struts were easier to do. I suggest having two floor jacks. One heavy duty to jack the car and the other light duty to support the struts. Remember to use jack stands to support the vehicle. The front strut bolts are all easy to access, but a heavy duty breaker bar or impact wrench are necessary to remove the two large bolts. If you have rust on the bolts start using a pentrating oil days in advance of the installation. The instructions from Monroe was adequate, but you need to read them carefully the first time. I is helpful to have a repair manual for you specific car for the finer points. The rear struts top tower screws are accessed only after you remove tne the right and left side seat bolsters. If you push the bottom seat down below the bolster to can access the single bolt. To remove the rear strut tower bolts I suggest ratcheting box wrenches. You can do it with a standard wrench but since there is little space to work it will take longer to remove them (due to the position of the rear speakers) The struts installed easily once to master the art of jacking up the struts and aligning the studs at the top of the struts with the holes in the tower. Two people are helpful for this part of the process. Once you have it assembled check for any pull that might indicate that you have wheel alignment issues. This is normal and a 4 wheel alignment should be considered."

I spent almost and hour pushing, pulling, and forcing the tubes to line up and I'm not confident that it did indeed line up after installation. I don't know if this will cause any problems or not, it will likely just leak air into the intake runners bypassing the tubes, but the OE part that came off the engine lined up perfectly."

I did clear up the cloudiness somewhat, I just hope it lasts. But I can't fix the burned plastic on the one side. So I'm kinda disappointed, I fixed the issue but now have two new issues----burnt plastic lens (swirl marks), and a big scratch next to my headlight. So just be warned. Good Luck."

127144,0,"We bought this Schumacher SE-5212A Automatic Handheld Battery Charger a year ago and it did what it is supposed to do. It charged the battery and jumped our chevy avalanche on several occasions. However, the cable coming from the charger is not reinforced at the beginning and it began fraying after the first couple of uses. The last time we used the charger it actually tripped our braker. I thought wrongly the higher price meant better quality but now I just replaced it with another cheapo charger from amazon. Worked one time already and if that one dies in a year I won't cry about it. Sending the first charger back for repair would be a financial joke for the customer - and the manufacturer knows it."
91938,2,Took a chance on these since the price was right and they got good reviews here. Put them on my 98 Chevy Tracker and they chattered...both sides. Tried to adjust the arms but the rubber is just too stiff. Took them off and purchased a pair of OEM for $20.
6384,0,"You can not beat the deal on this helmet, I got it for riding my ATV because I'm a more casual rider and I am no longer inclined to do things that will get me killed. It is very comfy, It's cool looking but the last time I went riding with my friend we were going down a hill that was not that steep at all and he rolled end over end with his ATV landing on his back and his rack smacking him in the head. He had a full faced helmet and it had seriously deep gashes in it when all was sead and done. He should not have survived the wreck and had he been wearing a helmet like this he wouldn't have. I wouldn't wear it on the street or on the trail after that."
19836,1,The gloves fit great. The leather is soft and supple. It is not so thick as to hindled movements that can be a problem with most motorcycle gloves. I can pick up a nickel from the floor wearing these gloves!
105811,2,"I have a 1999 VW Passat, and I haven't changed my wiper blades myself all that often -- generally the auto parts store employees come out and do it for me (good and bad for obvious reasons). It took me FOREVER to figure out that I didn't need to use the adapter included in their package -- the adapter was needed to install my previous blades, and they fit on the end of the hooks just perfectly, so it was mind-boggling to me that the wiper wouldn't install. Omitting that made wiper installation a ""breeze."" I am STILL steaming. I would have appreciated one tiny statement on the instructions saying that the adapter might not be necessary."
99292,2,"If you happen to buy this remote, be sure to also buy a good supply of AAA batteries as they don't last much longer than a few weeks with this unit. At least for me, this is how it's been."
40872,2,"I bought this Kit for 25$ normally selling for 100$, I see the reason they had it on such a discount. The kit was decent for 25$, Originally wanted it for the air compressor to have a backup for the one my sister lost, but this one is rather cheap, the spotlight didn't work off its own battery till i opened it up to figure out why the it wasn't getting power from battery. The jumpstart was able to start one of my lawnmowers with the battery removed. The power inverter worked well enough to run my laptop without blowing a fuse.UPDATE:I have now owned this for over a year.The Don't even bother trying to jump start a car with a dead battery because my 1996 honda civic needed it once and the pack was no help.The air compressor is a pain when you really need it because there is a break in the wiring that really isn't worth the cost to fix it, just takes some jiggling to I find the right spot.Spot light, occasionally works but has to be charged on a regular basis if you want to depend on it.Inverter still powers my laptop and cellphone charger during the rare times I need it.Gave away the emergency hammer before I got tempted to use it.-------------------Final Thought, DEFINITELY NOT WORTH more than 25$, more for amusement than a serious emergency. If you need heavy use don't go cheap, especially if you want to jump start a truck."
81081,1,"These have been on my car for about 6 weeks now. I don't agree with previous reviewers who say they are ""flimsy"" or made of ""cheap plastic,"" since my original factory Toyota-brand wheel covers were plastic also and no less ""flimsy"" than these. All four have stayed on despite hitting many of Colorado's big potholes. When installing, make sure they're snapped in all the way. One cap on the rear wheel looked like it was properly installed, but snapped in further on one side when I gave it yet another push. Not being fully popped in on all sides COULD be one of the reasons a few reviewers have lost a cover. These look sportier than my originals and you can't beat the price! Highly recommend."
167073,2,This thing has already stoped working only after few uses...
165433,1,"I've just bought some customized seats for my car and needed restoration on the 15yr old leather. Read lots of leather restoration techniques and leatherique was always recommended.The product does its job in cleaning the surface and making the leather supple enough for the filler to adhere to the cracks.(**note the filler does not come with this kit, I bought another leather repair kit from leatherworldtech.com which fills in the cracks and dyes the leather of your choice of color).The application is simple to apply, just spray it on the leather and ""bake"" it on a hot summer day with the windows up then wipe off with a wet sponge provided on the kit and leaves a nice pleasant smell.Most people criticize that the product does not last and has to be reapplied, well duh, that like saying I washed my car or vacuumed my rug and it didn't last...things get dirty.Overall the product has been recommended from other forum posts that it works better than the other kits."
33378,1,"All the gaskets in the set were in good shape and came with everything needed for a good, clean installation. Fel-Pro is a brand I've never had problems with."
54905,0,The two 4 1/2 lb jugs were shipped in a flimsy box. The lids on both jugs came off. The box was full of hand cleaner. Quite a mess. Due to the poor packaging I can't recommend buying.
49561,0,I purchased this for a drum as it was recommended on the product label. I think similar products would do the same trick.
88061,1,Installation was easy!! I really like the design and the way it fits my Jeep. Great product for the money!!
68526,2,Bought for my 2001 Ford F-150 and the cover snapped in half during installation. Easy to install after it broke. Good luck.
18312,1,"This is an excellent product. It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter. Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan. Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04. It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.Dixit"
169166,0,"I ordered this as well as the Motorad locking cap for my truck for comparison's sake. Well, the first Stant locking cap I received from Amazon did not actually lock. The locking mechanism was apparently broken. Now bear in mind that I had no trouble with the other locking cap AND I've had plenty of locking gas caps in the past, from various manufacturers, and never had any trouble with them, either. I can say that the key in this first one did, in fact, turn 90-degrees stop to stop, but it seemingly had no effect on the cap whatsoever. I tried this both with the cap on the fuel filler tube as well as by hand. It worked neither place, though it did fit my truck perfectly well.Of note, the ""instructions"" for the cap are actually printed on the cap itself, though strangely not on the box. It's a strange mechanism, but I suppose it works. To ""lock"" the cap, just put the cap on the filler tube and tighten until it clicks three times. No key necessary (a plus compared to most locking gas caps). At this point, the cap spins freely to the left (unscrew) but tightens if turned to the right, only to a point before it then clicks to release the tension. To unlock, insert the key, turn counterclockwise 1/4 turn and then back, remove the key and unscrew the cap.None of this, of course, worked on the first cap I received. So I asked Amazon to swap it out for me, and they did (quickly and painlessly, thanks Amazon!).The second cap worked as it is supposed to. The moral to this story is that quality control is critical, especially on a locking cap. This does, in fact, make me a little nervous about using this cap long term. We'll see.Anyway, this cap is going on a 2008 GMC Sierra Denali. Note that you MUST make sure you have the right cap for the application. One cap does not fit all. Amazon fitment guide did steer me to this cap and it fits just fine.This cap looks very similar to the stock GM cap except with a key mechanism in the top. The key is bare metal, which makes it slimmer, but also may scratch up the key fob (if you care about such things).Otherwise, this appears to be effective but nothing fancy. I'm not sure what it'd take to get a 5-star review (chrome? spinners? rhinestones?), but given the apparent dud I got the first go round, I'm not comfortable giving this one a 4-star review, either. Thus a 3-star review for a 3-star product."
134961,1,"For the money you will not find a better deal, well made easy to put together, will last a life time."
174955,1,I have a 2-Cycle lawn boy mower and it was a heavy smoker before I started using this wonderful product. Mixed a gallon of fresh gas (93 OCT/NO Ethanol) and 120ML of royal purple oil. Very little smoke upon startup and zero smoke after I started mowing. I heard this oil was good and now I understand what all the fuss was about. Can't wait to try it in my Toro Snowblower next winter!
87722,0,"The part that pushes into the existing cooler line to the radiator is cheaply made. Once I connected it all, it leaked real bad. Luckily I was able to salvage some parts from my old one to make this one work properly.After comparing the inside parts to each other, you can differently tell the difference between the two in the o-rings and snap connector."
168857,1,fitment was great. seems to help as much as any product in this category can.
100428,1,"I ordered this from a picture, and when I received it, it was exactly what I needed. It fit better than the original."
131911,2,"Very first use on chrome wheels, it self destructs. It flings off pieces to never never land. Dissappointed in this product."
179008,2,"I love this product on all my other cars and trucks! But Subaru has a frameless windows, so you have to mount this product so high to clear the door that it really doesn't do much of anything. Save you money if you car has frameless windows."
165889,0,"According to the vehicle information I entered, this rotor was supposed to fit my girl's car. It was obvious when I was installing it that there was no way in hell. Luckily I do own an Integra that these rotors do fit, so the next brake job I have for my car I will at least have new rotors ready. At least the price was good. The vehicle fitment drop down listings need to be fixed to avoid future mix-ups for other customers."
186291,1,"I have an 06 Sierra with the 5.3 liter also. Truck is a crew cab. The installation was easy and quick. The thing I noticed right away was the difference in power and response on acceleration. I had heard that the engine runs a bit louder, but that is only when you put your foot in it. I have heard some say that the transmission shifts smoother also, and I found the same to be true with mine.I was expecting a little bit better gas mileage from what others have said. I also replaced my spark plugs with NGK iridiums and MSD spark plug wires. I have noticed an increase in gas mileage, but not the 2 MPGs listed earlier. I have only had this on for about 2-3 weeks, so maybe I need more observation time. I think right now I'm probably getting about 1/2 to 1 additional MPG with the cold air intake, spark plugs, and wires."
58422,0,"I bought these for my 98 m3 4 door, they are working fine but I was disappointed with the price and fitment. There are two studs available for each of the roof rack mounts and these clips only use one of the studs. I bought my Yakima rack used, and it came off of a jetta with Q103 clips. The Q103 clips actually used both studs for each mount but the bend in the clip was slightly off and I want to have the correct fitment. It would have been nice if the Q18 clips used both available studs, and remember the package includes 2 clips, you will need 2 packages (4 clips) to fit your car."
79451,0,"The seat covers are functional, but do not fit well on my particular seats (Mustang). They are a bit too big, and don't stay put very well. But they seem to be decent quality."
183418,2,Cure time was nowhere near what the package stated and nearly cost me a LOT more than the epoxy cost.
160064,1,I recently had the stock oem water pump go out on my 2001 vw jetta vr6 wagon with the 2.8l engine and looking local pumps were $20 or more. I'm familiar with the Bosch name and locally this exact pump was $50 more so I grabbed it up from here and found that the impeller is cast metal as opposed to the cheap plastic prone to fin breakage that was the stock oem unit. Fit up was precise and the pump came with a quality ring gasket and so far no issues at all what so ever.
139162,0,I NEEDED THE CHARGER & COULD NOT FIND IT IN ANY STORE. THE PRICE OF IT WAS GOOD BUT AFTER PAYING ONLY $11.00 FOR THE PRODUCT & THEN $8.00 SHIPPING WAS A LITTLE PRICY.
93650,2,This power supply has stopped working. I am not satisfied with this purchase. I have only used it normally and would not expect that it would simply stop working.
121494,1,Meguiars has the best products overall for car care. This product works very well and last a long time too.
45594,2,"Background:I decided to replace my own brakes for the first time because I would rather spend the money on tools, knowledge, experience so I can do it myself for the rest of my life. I was able to get the calipers off but the bolts holding the caliper bracket wouldn't give. Heat, quenching, PB Blaster, nothing would move these bolts. I knew I needed an impact wrench.Side by Side:I first bought the Coleman Powermate 024-0077CT impact wrench because it was cheap and the specs seemed good to me. I thought 250lb of torque (Supposedly) would be enough to remove those stubborn bolts. No joy. The Coleman had a hard time with the lugnuts and didn't move the caliper bracket bolts at all.I went to a local store and purchased this Ingersoll Rand 231C wrench. I got it home and it buzzed those bolts out like they were only in finger tight! I made no changes to the air compressor and all of the other parts (e.g. air hose, sockets, etc.) were the same.Results:You really do get what you pay for. I only wish I would have read the Amazon reviews before I wasted money on the Coleman. Oh, and I paid approx $50 more than Amazon price for the IR wrench locally. :("
121268,1,"This was an awesome deal on this mirror. It fit perfectly, we had no issues with installation. You can tell no difference between it and the one originally on the truck."
167995,1,I bought this product to replace my motorcycle OEM lights because I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollar to replace plastics and couple more hundreds for the light assembly without money from insurance. Instructions to connect everything was simple and clear. Light output was great from what I tested in a parking lot at night standing still. I didn't get to drive it at night. I've rode the bike around for a test drive or two before I rode it to work and was involved in another accident. People just can't judge distance or notice motorcyclist.
124318,1,"I installed this in my 69 Datsun 2000, installation took an evening. It would have taken much less time if I wasn't simultaneously struggling with unrelated wiring issues. The control box has an LED on it that will light up when it's intended to spark. This is a great tool for static timing an engine, line up the appropriate timing mark on the front pulley and then adjust the distributor to the point where the LED first turns on."
159038,2,When you buy cheap Chinese products its no surprise that they don't work. The first clock didn't work and the replacement din't work. I'm out $20.00 in shipping since these where a gift to my brother. You might actully see if a item functions before you sell it!!!
4708,0,"I bought this item to display, coolant temp, throttle position, spark advance and manifold pressure for my 2005 subaru Impreza RS. The unit did not connect to the car so I tried it on my 2004 volvo and it worked, sort of. The readings were slow to respond, I was looking for something a little quicker.PRO- Alot of data can be transmitted to the unitThe Scan gauge 2 is very easy to useIt has a great screen and very easy to readCon- It does not compute some readings fast enough as compared to a conventional gaugeIt did not work with my carFor a great price, great functions it's worth all the money. But if you want accurate readings check out Autometer gauges"
182466,0,Pretty useful but the installation is a little convoluted and the big beefy hing that I liked so well hold on to heat like no other. I have actually burned the crud out of my arm on it. Sothwesterners beware!
85366,0,maybe easy for others. did not work for me. not worth the money or the time it took to discover it was a sticky mess.
135217,0,"I have a few classic cars that often sit for a few months or more. I bought this tool to swap out the gas. The tool works well if you have a straight shot so it still gets 3 stars. If you have any angles in the filler pipe it makes it almost impossible to move the end up and down fast enough to create suction. I ended up making a tool out of two copper pipes in a ""Y"" with clear tubing on one branch of the Y and tubing on the base. I then blow air with my air compressor through the other branch of the Y and it quickly creates the siphon I need."
38549,0,"I had a crack creep its way up from the base of the windshield for about 8 inches.Read the instructions several times per the other reviews on Amazon. Definitely necessary. The instructions say to go VERY VERY VERY slowly along a crack (10 seconds per centimeter, which is 3 minutes and 20 seconds for my crack).After following all the instructions, I can still see the crack. If the product, nonetheless, stops the crack from progressing further, it will have been worth the money and the three stars. If the crack keeps growing, I'll come back and downgrade it to two stars."
87854,0,"This bag setup will work fine for most buyers. For me it works as described but I had to remove my swaybar. I previously was running a Hellwig setup that gave up after 12 years of use. I did have a problem with one side leaking down, but a call took care of the issue and the replacement parts were sent after spending 20 minutes on the phone with Air Lift."
13129,1,"I can't believe how much money I've wasted all these years. I bought this replacement air filter for my 1995 Honda Civic. The car is old, but still giving me 40mpg. Got this on Amazon for under $40, won't need another filter for this vehicle. All you need to do is wash and apply oil after filter is dried. I should of bought this years ago."
113228,1,"I installed this on my 1986 Mercruiser 140 (181 CID, 4 Cyl) to replace a 26 year old one with a bendix going out. What a difference, and a perfect match! Starter comes with a solenoid, just as pictured. $66 total cheaper than West Marine."
94903,2,"Both packaging and description say this converts to 5v (used by satellite radios, among other devices). This is false -- the dial goes from 4.5 to 6 with no step in between. In addition, none of the included plugs actually fit my radio (which may or may not be the manufacturer's fault but is annoying either way)."
186643,0,"Over the years I've learned that there is no such thing as a ""bolt on"" accessory.This is no exception. Several holes have to be drilled in the TJ frame and rear crossmember. The discovery that the license plate bracket has to be moved or reworked really annoyed me. As a result, it is still on the garage floor until I figure out another solution. The bumper itself is well built, but there are warnings that the 2"" receiver cannot be used for towing. I generally like Warn products. I just don't like the little surprises. P.S. I wound up notching out my OEM plastic license plate frame to clear the latch support. I also had to order some 3/8"" spacers (McMaster-Carrs)to properly bolt the lower bumper tabs to the frame."
99800,1,"easy to tell battery status charges batteries fast really well made batteries last a lot longer on than they did with other chargers i""ve used"
47444,0,"I am sure the unit will do all the things it is rated to do, I have not yet needed to try to jump a dead car battery with it. I used the light once, but where my disappointment lies is that I thought it would run my electric boat motor. Which it will not do. So I carry it in a vehicle just in case I need it for another purpose. I hope at that time it will function as it is meant to. I feel confident that using it for it's intended use it may work well. If it doesn't start a dead auto, if I ever need it to, then I suppose it was a waste of money.Jon."
74398,0,"This is a good sized chamois. However, there was a 1 1/2 inch tear at one end of the chamois, and it had been sewn up. That is unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. The company should ship only first-class products. They should note in the product description if the chamois has been repaired. Another problem is the idiotic packaging. The chamois is stapled to the cardboard instructions with huge staples that leave holes in the chamois. It's a classic case of not thinking on the part of the manufacturer. This could be a good product, but you are taking a chance when you order. I would send it back but it's not worth my trouble at this point. I'd advise buying one you can check before you buy e.g. at Wal-Mart or another discount store. I'm not blaming Amazon but the supplier of the chamois."
59440,0,"Make sure you order a couple sizes bigger than what your kid is. I did that mistake when I ordered the extra small for my four year old, who is in size 4t. The jacket was way too small for him. Other than that the quality of the jacket was pretty good."
120136,2,"I think of the Bosch name highly, so when I couldn't find a rear window wiper replacement for my 2004 Jeep Liberty at any auto parts stores, I bought this one.The first test of whether a windshield wiper is any good in my mind is whether or not the blade is replaceable. It seems to me that in the last ten years, most manufacturers want you to have to replacement everything every time, not just the blade -- more money for them and more hassle for consumers and more waste.I wasn't quite sure which little adapter piece to use, but I chose one that seemed to work. I installed it, but the blade didn't touch the window on the far ends. It would wipe in the middle, but would miss large strips on the ends. I tried to bend it some, then it broke.Back to the hunt; off to the trash can.(Note: I see in the Amazon picture that it end looks bent outwards...)"
57123,0,"well, looks very nice, but there is NO gage to tell you when tires are full. You just have to guess, or take out a whatever that thing is to measure the pressure. I kept it, but not wild about it. It is nice an small, I will say that about it."
37169,2,A picture shown is totally different. And Coilover is only front. I wanted all front & Rear Coilovers. Really disappointed.

187966,1,"This console is very cool, the mount is easy (if you use self tapping screws ;) and looks great it even has a light in the main compartment that comes on when you open it, although if you do like me and leave your jeep exposed to the elements sometimes give the lock a little squirt of WD-40 from time to time."
145624,0,"My first impression was that this is an excellent choice for cup-holders for people like myself that own older cars. They are very easy to install and look good in the car. The problem comes when you try to use them. As long as you are using small to medium sized cups/bottles, you're ok but they will not accomodate either 16 oz. or 22 oz. water bottles.As long as you're ok with drinking ""Grande"" not ""Venti"" sized coffee and can live with 12 oz. water/drink bottles, these are well worth the money."
163158,1,"Simple job! Takes about 45 minutes and all you need is 3 tools: 7mm socket, 10mm socket and a screwdriver. Pry off the mirror panel, pull out the door electrical switch plate and unplug the switch, pull off the inner handle trim, remove the 2x 7mm socket head screws holding the arm rest (one in the switch plate access and one under the armrest), pull up on the armrest and the entire door panel will pull off but disconnect the speaker cable at the front and the light at at the rear before you move it too far. Now remove the 10mm bolt that holds the inner door handle and pop the clip to remove the actuator rod and slide the assembly out. Now carefully peel off the plastic door liner without damaging it. You do need it! Raise the window all the way up, tape it in place with duct tape (non-residue type means no cleanup), loosen the front and rear window clamps a couple of turns, unplug the motor, remove the 6x 10mm regulator bolts and remove the old regulator. Installation is the reverse process. If you can change spark plugs you can do this and save yourself a couple hundred dollars!"
90578,2,Did not work when received. front panel poorly assembled and loose. I would look at other battery chargers before buying this one.
45053,0,"I have a 95 Explorer. I installed the Hurst shifter for Rangers/Explorers that includes a shifter stick that places the ball slightly forward and lower than the stock shifter. This stick has been mentioned as a possible alternate, being taller and angled more aftward. I tried it briefly but found it was a bit too tall (but the aft position was good). The increased height puts the throw about the same as the OEM shifter, which is a disappointment after the short Hurst stick in the basic replacement kit. The stick height also made it feel like driving a Rat Fink car (not really that bad, but definitely closer to the dash). All-in-all, I like the original stick in the Hurst shifter better. That said, I think would use this stick for Explorers with a 2"" - 3"" body lift kit."

7561,0,"This unit has a large screen which is easy to read when plugged into a vehicle which automatically turns on the back light. Running off of the battery in regular room light the display appears fuzzy, it has large buttons. It does have the features needed to diagnose your car. I do not like the 9 volt battery, it is troublesome to gain access to requiring the removal of a cover with a small screw driver. If the item is not used on a daily basis it is probably a good idea to remove the battery for storage. I'm in fear of destroying the fragile wired connector to the battery. It comes with a really nice durable hardshell case and OBDI cables for Ford, Toyota, Chrysler, Jeep, and GM. The OBDII cable feels akward as it requires an adapter cable to plug into the unit. It also has alligator clips for direct power connection to the battery or can be powered from a cigarette lighter. I have only used the 9 volt battery option as it would feel like carrying a spider around with all the other cables hooked to it. The unit comes with a CD that is supposed to work with Windows but I have never been able to do internet updates or get the software to install properly. If I ever get updating to work properly it does have a nice usb cable to hook to the computer much like my camera. Also when purchasing this I somehow thought that it had ABS scanning. It does not, only OBDI & OBDII.A friend of mine has the Innova 3140 which has all the same features, selectable backlight however the screen is smaller. The Innova also appears to have a faster refresh rate and longer storage time at a lower price. If I could do it over again I would save myself some money and buy the Innova 3140. sure would miss the hardshell case but that is a option I feel I could live without."

181883,2,"this product is poorly made. the first time i attached it to the seats, the straps ripped off. i have to return it. also, it is pretty bulky. if you have short legs, the fan will hit your legs causing it not to work well. i read all of the positive reviews and thought this was going to be a great product. I am very disappointed with it."
148859,0,"This product is ok, but it could be made better. It is difficult to get it tight enough on the visor to keep it from drooping."
6142,0,This product seems like it will work well although I haven't had the chance to use it yet. It seems like it is well made and the heavy rubber should keep it from slipping. My only issue was that I thought the product would come with two wheel chocks not one. Be sure you order two if you need two!
61178,1,"Had a K&N Air Filter on my 2004 Honda 599 (Hornet), and liked both the slight performance increase, and the sound the intake makes now. Well, after getting my 2006 VFR800 VTEC, I figured it couldn't hurt. It did not! It seems the bike runs a little smoother, and sound and performance are much better, especially after the second set of valves kick in at about 6400 RPM. And as said by ""Brock"", it does make more sense to not have to buy a new filter every time, plus I actually got it for less money than what Honda was charging for the OE filter."
47753,1,"Well - it solved my problem - I bought a used Ford Ranger that developed a case of stumbling and hesitation at high speed or climbing hills. I changed the fuel filter and threw in a bottle of Techron, and the problem was gone, and it's still fine a couple of months later. I don't think there's anything special about Fram - any new fuel filter would've solved the problem - it was low cost, though."
36174,1,"We've had this unit for about a year, and we recently bought one for my wife's father. Good unit that we used during Hurricane Ike when we were without electricity for almost 3 weeks. We ran a light, small TV, and fan without a problem using the cigarette plug and starting the car (Tahoe) from time to time to recharge the battery. We also use it on roadtrips so kids can play DVDs and we can recharge phones that don't have car chargers. Some reviewers complained about fan noise-level, but we don't find that to be an issue. Our only issue was that the cigarette lighter plug is plastic and it broke one time when trying to remote it from car lighter. The screwoff tip broke part of the threaded plastic wall inside it. I superglued the plug together and haven't had an issue since. All in all, I think this unit is a good value."
109410,2,"I ordered an Accutire MS-5510B gauge Friday and received it this Monday -- unfortunately, it did not work.No light, no nothing. I removed and tested the batteries. They were 100% discharged -- completely dead. I went out and spent $9 for three new batteries and the gauge now works perfect. But Amazon and Accutire don't have customer service phone numbers so it appears I am out the $9. Yes, I could have gone through the trouble of returning the gauge for another -- but what assurance is there that the next gauge won't also have dead batteries. A last note: My neighbor has the same gauge and there is a one lb. difference at the 30 to 34 lb. range between our gauges -- who do you believe? So much for accuracy!"

89343,1,"Second door handle purchased and it fit perfect, as did the first one. Exact duplicate of factory OEM with a substantially lower price. Customer was happy with look & fit. Why use OEM ?"
163883,2,Did not work at all. Tried to install several different ways. Finally tried a simplier way found on the web...and finally resolved my humming sound.
155203,1,I installed the Wolo Air Horn on my Harley as the stock horn isn't loud at all. All went well and the Wolo is a big improvement over the stock horn. Now the cars can hear me.
169925,1,"What a great seat. It not only looks good on my bike it is very comfortable. With the stock seat my back was always arched, but with the mustang seat it's like there is a lower back support and my back is always straight. Great padding and excellent craftsmanship. No problem switching seats either. This is one of my better investments."
130378,0,"I have to agree with the comment here about these not being great for sleet. Ice builds up under the blades, lifting the blades off the windshield, and rendering them useless."
146203,2,Despite stating it would fit my 2003 Lexus gx470 it would not fit. Mechanic said despite the manufacturer stating it was the correct part (he checked it out too) it was not the right part and he had to order the part listed for the 2002 Lexus gx470. So I don't know how to rate the quality of the part since I was not able to use it but they need to update their records to show that it doesn't fit 2003 Lexus.
64960,2,"I can't believe the quality of this product not only did it break it leaked from the get go, the flap that actually diverts the exhaust blew out on me on the freeway no more then 2 weeks after install same happened to a friend who had his installed when I ordered mine."

84046,1,Permatex threadlocker is not the only good threadlocker out there but it's as good as any other (I've used) and the Gel Pen is the deciding factor. The Gel Pen is the only threadlocker dispensing method I'll use anymore. So neat and tidy and just as strong as the liquid threadlockers. A+A+A+A+A+
14285,0,"This is a good radio and I was glad I had it when my power was out for 9 days during hurricane Ike. However, I thought the sales description said you could pick up the audio of 13 local TV stations and that is not the case so that part was disappointing during the hurricane and I would have preferred TV news audio to radio news."
155529,2,"2 of the 4 U bolts cross threaded, and had to cut them off with a grinder. I had to go to the part store and buy more bolts. I tried to get the threads on the bolts to work, but no success. A one hour job turned into a three hour job. Before the project, I wanted to give them a five star rating, because how could you mess up 4 bolts and a block? Now I'm worried the cheap chinese steel is going to fatigue and break, resulting in an accident."
50589,1,"I would only make one minor change, the applicator that comes with the wax is on the larger side which makes it a little difficult to get into some of the nooks on my VRM v710 wheels. Otherwise the product is great, easy on and easy off, very little dust."
84171,1,"These bushings and spacers ought to be included. The spacer is beefy and a perfect fit, over the stock 1/2"" bolt. The stock spacer and replacement that came with my new shocks looked wimpy, crushed,and deformed when I got mount bolt to the proper torque.... Not with these solid spacers . A+"
51240,0,"Bought these to replace the same exact morrors I had on my 66 F250. The first set rusted the first Winter we had here in Colorado and so did these. I was expecting it to happen. They are very inexpensive mirrors but they give you a great big view. They get rusty very quick but it is just surface rust and it matches my old beat up pickup. If you are buying these for the first time, remember that they are big mirrors and will block cars from view if you arent careful. They are worth the cheap price. I only replaced them because someone broke my first set while it was parked in front of my house."
155620,0,"Not enough time has passed to rate durability, but ease of applying is great, and no residue to speak of is very nice. Shine looks great."
96501,0,"Im giving it three stars because:Pros: it has a double locking system, unlike other jack stand that say that they do, and don't, it obviously has a double locking system as you can see.Cons: it is smaller and thinner than other 3 ton jack stands.It does not match the height of jack stands that I already own."
42251,2,"I bough 19"" and 26"" PIAA replacement silicone wiper blades refills. I used the chart to select the size for a 2010 Toyota Prius. The length was fine but the width was narrow because my car takes a wider width. I read were a lot of people were having this same problem. This company should go back and redo there chart so they will have the right sizes for the cars."
62393,1,"The light output difference between the virtually clear, 60W PIAA bulbs and the lightly blue tinted, 65W Solaris bulbs is, if any, too small to calculate without instrumentation. What obvious differences exists between these two equally expensive brands of high beam bulbs (9006 is the designation used to identify your low beam bulbs) are twofold, that being, first of all, their kelvin temperatures, (which has nothing at all to do with heat, but everything to do with the color of their light outputs) 4000K for the PIAA bulbs and 4300K for the Solaris bulbs, making the Solaris bulbs the whiter of the two. The 9006 HID (High Intensity Discharge) headlights that come standard or as an option on most of today's new cars range between 4000K and 4300K, so you'll have to determine for yourselves which of these two brands provides the best high beam kelvin match for your car's low beam HID system. The second difference is the fact that the Solaris bulbs project their light at a little higher angle than do the PIAA bulbs, so if you're driving a small Honda Accord, for instance, these are the bulbs for you. If you're driving a larger car, say a Lexus ES300, you'll be better off with the PIAA bulbs. Unlike many other 9005 bulbs on the market today that have much higher current draws which can damage your wiring and headlamps, heavy blue tints that consequently produce far less light output than that supplied by the better designed PIAA and Solaris bulbs, neither one of these two bulbs should cause you a problem--by virtue of the heat they generate if your car's headlamps were originally designed for use with halogen bulbs. While admittedly expensive these high performance bulbs will significantly improve the high beam performance of any vehicle equipped with standard, halogen bulbs. If you happen to be on a tight budget then you can't go wrong with the 9005, 65W, 4000K Silverstar bulbs from Sylvania. Happy and safe night driving to you one and all."
88447,2,"Nice looking but needs work to install on a any type of regular sedan vehicle.Comes with screws that need a lot of work to fit, and a junky allen wrench.got loose in less than a day. lots of work to tighten and maintain.A competitor could clean up by making a better version. Don't waste your money."
8323,2,"It's depressing that these scrapers have gained a near-monopoly in retail stores. Most have small manufacturing defects--little chips or protrusions on the edge--which make it impossible to remove all of the ice or frost in one pass. Although the design has the potential to conform the scraping edge to curved glass, the plastic is too stiff for that to happen effectively.I've had much better luck with brass-blade scrapers. These will not scratch most windshields (though I've experienced significant scratching in cheaply-made windshields)."
73572,2,"Bought this to pull heavier loads, but have only used it on a light trailer so far. In the picture, it has a satin finish and looks like stainless, but the description correctly says it's chrome plated. It seems robust enough, but after only one use much of the chrome has already worn off, even though a light coat of grease was applied before use. I wouldn't recommend this ball because of the poor quality of the chrome plating. My lighter-duty Reese hitch ball purchased at the local Walmart has better chrome plating and looks nicer after years of use."
62083,0,"This item is very easily assembled,installed and looks nice on my Nissan Xterra. My only concern is it's durability since it's completely constructed of some type of plastic. I'd give it 5 stars if some of it was metal. The product description doesn't fit this product...shame on you Amazon. Go Gators!"
1756,1,"Did the job! Four seven hour days powering laptop in car. Only complaint, power light not visible in daylight."
158210,2,We purchased the 1500 Watt power pack. The only appliance connected to it was an answering machine. It was charged daily for about 8 hours. 3 weeks later the battery would no longer charge. Sent it back and have not heard anything. They are very hard to get in touch with
107644,0,"The ball joint needed modification to fit properly. The top of the ball joint was too large to fit into the steering knuckle.Since I had a grinder it was no big deal, but someone without the right tools would have had to send them back. The holes for the bolts were also not quite right and I had to drill those holes a little larger as well."
105101,1,"I love this product it is cut to fit, it really protects the car from heat, i even went ahead and bougth one for my brother's car as well and he loves it also."
341,2,"I thought this product would really come in handy for camping. But after owning it for just a couple of days, I accidentally tipped it over and that was all it took. The lantern would not work. I sent away for a new bulb, but that did not fix the problem.This is a well thought out product that offers many handy features. Unfortunately, with typical Black and Decker quality, don't expect it to last long or to take even the slightest jarring. It could be a nice emergency item in case of a power blackout, but I would not recommend trying to take it anywhere on a trip because it is bound to break."
87045,1,"This is the best windshield product on the market. Use this monthly, and the rain will bead-off your windshield. I have used Rain-X for years, and now to have it on an applicator, makes treating your windshield a no-brainer."
99085,2,"Beware! After using this product as directed it caused major problems. A small amount of ""liquid"" product leaked from duct on internal ecm and short circuited car electrical system. Major repair bill!! Do not use!"
119986,1,"It was a pleasure to find a product that is well made, fits perfectly, is easy to install and had all the right bolts to mount it. It didn't take ten minutes to install and I did it by myself. A helper would have been nice but once I got one bolt holding a side, the rest were a snap to align and tighten.It looks good and performs well. Great product."
50915,2,"Ordered a mirror of what was depicted in the photo of the order, sent quite another - oval. That is good - this is a review of the rear view, and this is the only plus. Being in the passenger compartment of the vehicle in hot weather from under the mirror drip glue, he dripped directly on the vehicle. It is terribly. I do not advise to order the model of the mirror."
150768,2,"First of all, I didn't need all I ordered. I should have looked more closely to what I was buying. After trying the product on a cell phone case with both grades of scratch remover and the polish I was not to impressed. Because of the gritty compound it just added finer scratches."
153485,1,"K&N is awesome!!! Great filter, you definitely notice the increase performance when accelerating. The only drawback is that you have to clean and recharge the filter when it gets dirty, which by the way is easy when you buy the K&N filter recharge kit."
9762,2,This is very awkward to install. And it has some dangerously sharp metal slivers that will rip your flesh open if you are not extremely careful.
175233,1,the order was on time and was just what it was supposed to be thanks for another pleasant online shopping experience
118638,1,Installed on my 2007 Acura TSX with no problem. These are the same brand the dealership uses and they are great quality.
6379,2,"When I saw this helmet, goggle and face mask combo I thought they would be great. When I received them I found the goggles were cheaply made face mask was nothing more than a cheap rag and as far as the helmet goes. This helmet catches air when your riding and chokes you. When the helmet isn't choking you from all the drag it's blowing back like its going to come off. The chin straps are horribly placed and the helmet doesn't sit down on your head far enough. As poorly as this helmet is built there is no way it would help or be safe in a crash. I wouldn't recommend this helmet to my worst enemy."
165567,2,"This may be an unfair review, but the product didn't work for my own oil filter. It may work for others just fine, but I still have to give my 2 cents. Especially if your oil filter is deeper into the engine, I think you will have a hard time using this tool. I'm just going to have to take my car to the shop next time I change oil and ask them not to over tighten the filter, so that I can remove it by hand."
18576,2,"This is a relatively low quality product made from what appears to be a good material but there is no overlapping where the material is stitched together so I expect it to pull apart before the fabric itself fails. The mirror pockets are cut 2"" too short so the mirrors have to be folded back against the car to be able to put the cover on without a lot of stretching of the material and the seams where the mirror pockets attach to the made body of the cover.This is the 4th car cover I have bought in recent years and though not the least expensive it is the mostly cheaply made. The quality of the sewing and the seams is not as good as on cheap $60 car covers. When it fails in a year or two I definitely will not be buying a Coverking car cover to replace it.For the price it is a poor value car cover."
89322,2,Does not work as described. Mushroom plug is rubber and simply gets compressed in the tool. Will NOT fix a tire.
36823,0,disappointed! i thought it would be deeper to hold larger bags standing up. it is not as deep as the on that came with my car a Cadillac.
164377,0,"Certainly cannot complain about the good quality, however, this cushion is much to firm for me...and I weigh 210lbs. It moves aroud alot so I'm constantly having to readjusting its position. If you're unable to adjust the chair rearward sufficiently, this cushion makes you feel like you're being launched foward."
64664,1,"There is no foam around the edge of the filter for a air tight fit, but besides that it will do."
17420,0,"Do yourself a favor, get a DOT certified Helmet. Safety First.This one is a good choice the only complain I have is that the painting goes off very easy."
42364,2,"The device does not do what it is supposed to do. Failed to provide timely warning of imminent battery failure. Also I could not get it to provide some of the information it was supposed to provide according to the instructions. I feel this device is a gimmick not worth putting on your car, just check your battery once in a while as you should!It does provide voltage info, and that is the only reason I gave it two stars..."
147025,1,"I am a drag racer from the 1960's and I have always used Valvoline products in my racing engines and in my family vehicles. Full Synthetic was not available then however Valvoline then was ahead of the crowd for lubrication protection, anti-sledge build up and thermal stability.I started using the Valvoline synthetic when it came out years ago. Although I do not use it in racing engines any longer I do use it in a variety of high performance applications and in my 4 wheel drive.All of my vehicles have Valvoline full synthetic oil and I can say I have not had any kind of failure, cold start up performance is terrific, I believe the synthetic coats the cylinder walls and does not bleed down like regular oil. I have two vehicles that are dual overhead cam, all aluminum engines that operate a high RPM and I am entirely satisfied with the protection and performance of Valvoline full synthetic.The Amazon price with supersaver shipping is equal to or beats all of my local retailers even the big one that starts with ""W"".I recommend."
182316,0,This kit is not made for 2003 Jeep Wrangler. I have a Wrangler 2003 and the factory wire is 3-wire not 4. This kit will not function as advertised if you do not check your wiring behind your tail light prior to purchase. For a four wire system this is a good harness
30796,1,"Replacing a headlight should be easy, the bulb worked once I was able to finally get inside and get the old bulb out. I'm convinced dealers want you to bring the car in so they can bill you for one hour of labor."
158817,0,"I love Weather Tech and have a set in my Honda Accord. I wanted the same protection for my 2007 Chevy Tahoe. Let me just say, these do not fit like a glove like my Honda's do. I would have gone with Husky Mats if I would have knowen that they wouldn't fit perfectly!"
165989,0,"I wanted a horn to be deeper than my whinny Japanese Subaru horn. wee, wee. I was embarrassed honking that horn. Even though this horn is a lot better, I still feel the higher frequency horn still overpowers the lower one and still gets that beep beep sound instead of the honk honk sound. If you want a deep sounding horn, look else where."
122374,1,"I have had this for years and everyone who sees it wants one, it protects my dashboard and looks good as well!"
183209,0,"I recently purchased these mats and I was dissappointed once I recieved them in the mail. They look alright, and will fill their aesthetic purpose, but as far as durability, these are not the mats you are looking for. They are quite flimsy and cheaply made. I don't see them lasting very long in my husbands truck. For the price I was definitely expecting more. My advice to you is to save your money...."
130486,1,"Not much to say about these, They are clips and they fit. They also come with a protective sticker that you put on the end of the clip to protect the paint on your car. It works great and I don't have any scratches."
134284,1,"Solid feel to the construction, and a wide range of flow options. I like this nozzle, though with the understanding that it takes two hands to operate water flow as opposed to nozzles that have triggers."
4359,0,"I really wish it would stay as rigid & open as it is shown in the picture. I need something that will stay like looking like what is pictured, not start deteriorating/falling inward. It hasn't had any liquid in it, just tissues, wrappers, has held up for that. Going to test the front pocket as I am planning on holding a 9"" dvd screen in it. Will review again."
153845,1,"I agree with the comment about let's be realistic here but I was very pleasantly surprised at the performace. I bolted this on to the front of my trailer so that I could pull stuff up a set of ramps and drag to the front to balance the load.My ramps are long but the grade must be at least 30*. This little beast pulled Bubba the Steam Cleaner right up the ramps and dragged it to the front of the trailer without a noticeable change in pitch or effort. Bubba is ~300# with wheels only on the back and two rubber snubbers on the front. I had to keep the cable held up a bit so Bubba jumped a bit on the ramps. I had some rubber left on the ramps from the scraping and I could care less. Excellent performance.After unloading Bubba, I loaded a BIG engine crane. Rolled it to the back of the trailer, looped the cable around the top and the winch easily pulled it over and dragged it to the front.I can't ask for more than that.BTW, after I loaded Bubba one of my off-road buddies told me that you need to leave the engine running while winching to protect your battery.Amazon, their sale price/free shipping and standing behind their product does it once again!!"
48849,2,"The only pro to this pump is that it pumps like a champ.The cons are:Smooth exterior, no handle, relatively heavy and therefore easy to drop.Extremely short air hose and AC power cord.Cover for the short hose and AC power cord, but no cover for the DC power cord, it comes unraveled in the trunk.The power button is located inside the DC power cord storage area so you either have to take out the DC power cord to get to the power switch or you have to try to force your fingers into the compartment to get it to turn on.Useless ""industrial"" add-ons of faux nuts which are just little plastic pieces that fall off."
42102,2,The base of the blade was to wide to fit the chanel it needed to go into. You would have to force it in damaging the wiper as well as the blade.
87018,1,This product works as advertised. I use it all the time to remove hard to peal protective paper from Stainless Steel sheets
169947,0,"It's made by Icon, so the bag is really well made. The magnetic tabs and everything are great, but this bag is SOOOOO TINY. I ended up getting the Urban tank bag they make so that I could take my laptop and shoes with me."
92572,1,"While on a road trip to change a tire on a Sovereign, I ran into a problem. I didnt have the right socket to remove the axle nut. I borrowed one, and ordered this when I got back to the shop. OTC makes all kinds of large sockets, I have a 3-3/4"" OTC socket too. Great quality and is perfect for Aircraft use. Thanks Tooltopia."
34342,0,"The lights are fantastic and fit the factory mounting location perfectly, however the switch that came with the wiring harness was faulty."
152911,2,I was extremely disappointed with these floor mats. They were cheaply constructed - so they have been returned. Got much nicer ones at Walmart!
132637,0,"1st. the driver side bar was scratched. All of the half inch lock washers were missing. The bolt plates that were to slide in a hole in the frame wouldn't fit in, They had to be shortened and the bolts ground down. The pictures were good but it was up to me to decide which bar went where. Also if you install by yourself you will need a floor jack. They do look good and make it easier to get in the truck."
111016,1,Excellent tool all of Lisle tools have been what they were expected for the application needs. This tool is what is required to remove a tilt steering wheel on a GM vehicle.
36068,1,"The price was very good. I like shopping Amazon.com a lot. I used this inexpensive battery instead of purchasing a new lighting system for my camera, which would have been more than I could afford."
9099,0,"First off let me just say that this unit is a heck of a lot better than the ones in your box stores. I have a construction company so there is always something with a dead battery everyday. This unit works good for the first, second, and 'sometimes' third jump but that's usually it. After about 8 days of heavy use I can only get the unit to recharge to about 70%- I may return it. My only other complaint is that when you are in a hurry and wrap the cables back up its very easy to slice into the cable with the handles."
36599,1,"I came across this digital air pressure gauge when I was looking for a replacement for my cheap + broken digital air pressure gauge.The pros:+ Very easy to use, with a nice shape that fits in your hand.+ Long lasting 3V lithium battery. I've never had to replace the one in my gauge & I've had it for years.+ Automatic power off.+ Audible chirp when the gauge is ready to use & when the pressure reading is stored.+ Measures up to 250 psi.+ Smarthead can be set to Presta or Schrader valves.+ Psi, Bar or kg/cm squared readings.+ attachment point for a lanyard.The cons:- Not the lowest cost digital air pressure gauge.- This pressure gauge may be hard to find, as a new version has replaced this one.- The power needs to be turned off & on to reset the gauge for the next reading. Kind of awkward, but you quickly get used to the process.- If the power button is pressed too hard, it will break the internal stop. This happen to my gauge, which required me to open it up & use super glue to repair the broken plastic piece."
165965,2,"I installed this onto my 2000 Altima but it took a lot of force to get it to line up the setting screw hole. I broke off a flange of plastic trying to get this part into place. Then I couldn't get it off. Will have to go to a shop for that. As for the setting screw, I stripped it with minimal effort and had to use the old one from the previous rotor."
48782,0,It works fine for what it is built to do. I will keep it and use it. I was looking for a small compressor that would blow air so I could clean my spne heaters. This doesn't do that but it will inflate stuff and you can preset it to only go so high in air pressure. It will come in handy.
155811,1,"I purchased and used these foam pads with my orbital sander machine and they worked great and did a fabulous job a polishing my boat. The small problem is how it attached to my orbital sander backing pad, which is a hook & loop type (Velcro). The backing of the foam pad is made for this type of attachment, but has a small fiber profile. The fibers should be larger and more aggressive for better holding power to the machine. After a short while of use, the foam pad would fly off the machine when I let go of the trigger and moved away from the surface I was polishing. I managed to finish the job by holding the machine and foam pad against the surface until it came to a full stop before removing the machine away. I never have this problem when using sanding disks."
161202,1,"I use this with a 50cc scooter and could not be happier with it's performance. It's a little ""Speed Racery,"" but I think it looks pretty cool. The flip visor is nicely designed, and after 3 months riding with it and throwing it around the house and at work when not in use, I haven't had any problems with it. I expected to get some scratches or to have the thing break off, but it's sturdy. It is also crystal clear to see through. Highly recommend this helmet."
29300,0,it works well but it does not have as good of a seal as the oem filter
21106,2,Louder than OEM in our Sportage but sounds like a freight train with a head cold. More of a loud grunt than a beep. Also they don't last very long. One of them just gave out after just a few months. Would NOT buy another of this brand/company.

138287,2,"I bought this item on clearance through a local retailer. A the time I thought I was getting a pretty good deal, but I now realize that it was a reason the store was getting rid of them. I am a college, and I use my mp3 player which has an audio recorder to record class lectures. However, the battery doesn't last very long and I was excited by the prospect of having an extended power supply.My excitement ended with my first attempt to use the product. I charged the unit upon purchasing it a couple weeks before classes started. The evening before my first class I checked the Black & Decker power supply before packing in in my bookbag, and it had no power. I thought that it wasn't unreasonable if the charge had dissipated over two weeks and plugged it into the wall and lest it overnight. The next morning I brought it to class with me. Three hours later when my audio recorder died I plugged it into the battery and there was not enough charge to even power the unit up.After a couple more attempts to charge the unit I realized that it was completely incapable of holding any charge for any length of time.I would highly recommend looking elsewhere for portable power."

8207,1,This fuel filter works like it should. The price is great too versus in-store prices. Installation was a breeze on my 2002 Mercury Sable. Make sure you buy some fuel line clips with this filter though so you don't run into the same problem I did. The clips are plastic and will probably break when you take them off. Saves you a trip to the auto parts store and saves time.
76708,0,"In a nutshell: It sticks to the window. It blocks the sun. It does not look too pretty.If you take the time to attach this properly it may even look nice, but that is not really the point. It works and I can even lower the window with this attached (not recommended by manufacturer)."
104172,1,The air fliter on my husbands bike was so bad (he just bought it used but previous ower haven't changed it since brought new) that he had to get new replacement. he looked everywhere but all were so high that we just couldn't afford it....that was till we found one on Amazon. I strongly recommend this product for the price and quality.

170398,2,"I should have trusted the bad reviews on this one. This didn't work. I tested it by draining my battery(left light on), and it failed to recharge the battery at all. I would have been upset if this happened for real. It just chirped and stopped. When I try to recharge the charger, it seems to never completely charge. After it chirps to let me know it is done, I can start it charging again and after awhile it chirps again, but I can get it charging again forever. The light on the charger does seem to work ok,and I was able to charge my cell phone using the charger. One reviewer said he kept returning the unit because it was defective. Maybe I got a defective unit, but it is almost completely useless. I needed a car battery charger not a cell phone charger. There are some great reviews for this and some bad reviews . Why does a company like black n decker not test their products better before selling them?"

155487,0,"First, allow me to say I did not buy this from Amazon, a vendor I've used happily for several years. The distributor listed here is the exact model I purchased from a well known discount auto parts shop (for about 2/3rds the price here). For some reason I didn't look on Amazon for it, although I usually shop them first. The distributor arrived in pristine condition, although the stainless cover on the control module was dented. There were several marks on the shaft varying from welded letters to series of numbers imprinted with a hammer and tool. There was literature referring to a pointer, referenced by a ""6"" or ""8"", neither of which I could find. There were several dabs of different colored paint spots on different places on the shaft and base. The white ones were alignment marks, but none of us could find a ""pointer"". We installed it as best we could according to enclosed instructions, which did not reference Cardone or the distributor number. (They were a generic photocopy from Automotive Cataloging). This was in an engine that had been accidentally cranked with no distributor in it, so we found TDC at #one cylinder. The engine was HEI with a TBI with 2 injectors. We disconnected the single wire to allow timing, and were unable to obtain 0 degrees at TDC. We moved the distributor one tooth each way. Close but not dead on. Test driving revealed hesitation and stumbling above 20 mph. It was obvious the dwell was not advancing. All other ignition/timing components on the engine were brand new. We took the distributor back for replacement. We are now on the third distributor. The markings on each one were vastly different. Never could find a pointer or a ""6"" or ""8"" for reference. The management from the shop, well experienced, could not find them either. (Finally we replaced the distributor with a new GM product. After installation the timing was dead on with no adjustments using an inductive timing light). Draw your own conclusions."

But Coverking customer service is not helping and would not sell just the replacement seat cover, has to sell 2 at a time, at full retail. Beware of their durability and quality control, and definitely beware of the customer service, or lack thereof."
58445,1,"Carton was a mess when it arrived. Chipped in the corner but useable, easy to install and does the job. would buy this product again."
47457,1,"I don't know what the people are thinking that give this item a one and two star rating because it isn't a gasoline-powered portable generator. No where in the description does it say it's a gas-powered generator, and these people are belittling a product that they bought because they made a mistake by not researching what the product was and because they don't seem to know the difference between a portable power-pack and a real generator.Now on to the product itself. This is a battery powered portable power unit, first and foremost. It is meant to be mainly used as a jump-start aid on cars with a low (not completely dead) battery. When used in this capacity, it excels at it's job, which is it's primary purpose. The rest of the items on this unit are emergency conveniences, and of course won't hold their own against stand-alone tools built for their specific purposes. The people at Xantrex threw in these few extras for convenience's sake. It has a flourescent utility light that lets you see what you're doing at night, don't expect it to act as a focus-beamed searchlight. The tubes light up bright and will run all night long without going dead. They also put a power inverter on it so that you can power small 110-volt tools if necessary but don't expect it to provide the power of a gas-generator or your ac-mains, and there's a 12-volt cigarette outlet too for 12-volt tools. They put a small compressor on it and it works fine for emergencies, but it's not meant to inflate tires all the time like a Campbell-Hausfield 10-hp dual-stage compressor with 50-gallon tank, it's an emergency convenience, and that's the point that should be remembered.I've been pleased with the reliability of my unit, I've had it and been using for 5 years without any incident. The battery takes and hold a charge well and the unit supplies all the power I need for small emergency situations when traveling or at home during a minor power outage.No, it won't run your TV set, it isn't meant to, but when used within it's meant capabilities it performs it's duties fine, such as running a nebulizer for emphazema medication during power outages, or running a small radio. But if you're needing to power large appliances, of course it won't work, you have to rate the power-source to the power consumption of the appliance, including startup surge capacity. In other words, read the power-rating on the appliance and look at the power rating of Xantrex, if the appliance meets or exceeds the rated load capacity of the Xantrex, don't plug it in, it isn't going to magically supply more power than it's capable of. If you want to run your TV, air-conditioner, hot-water heater, well pump, washer/dryer, dishwasher, home theater system, or refridgerator, then buy a gasoline powered generator instead. That's why I bought my 15-Kilowatt gas generator."

147270,0,"This product is not compatible with my 1995 Camry LE V6. None of the hookups fit any of the ODB ports - not even close. Read on the web that this was a transition year for Toyota.I bought this knowing full well that it was a (relatively) expensive version of a hot wire, but I was having trouble making my car blink the codes. If you don't like the hassle of stripping a wire and farting around with the ports, this could be worth your 25 bucks (if it works for you!).I'm returning it and am very happy with Amazon's return process, so far."
35425,0,"Purchased based mostly on price, but other reviews led me to believe this was going to be a good buy. Arrived quickly, and on first glance it is a gorgeous helmet. Glossy and plenty of padding; the chinstrap cinches with a slip buckle in place of a clasp if that makes a difference to you. The built-in neck protection hidden in the zipper looked nifty. Felt sturdy and weighty. Certainly was not going to test it by having my kid take a crack at my noggin with a baseball bat.So why am I returning it? The large felt a little cramped; I had tried other helmets from various manufacturers and ""Large"" felt about right based on listed measurements. Got it out of the box and I looked like I had melon on my head. I looked like a prison guard from ""Spaceballs"" and that would not give me confidence to be seen in traffic.If I had a smaller head I'd probably love it, but with that in mind, it's going back."
187260,1,"I bought this key ring for my boyfriend who recently bought one of the 6 series BMW's. Its a nice keyring and what he likes most is the ability for the 6 to fold up so that it fits nicely into his jean pocket. This one is more practical than the leather one I purchased for him, although that one is also of good quality, it is stiff making it almost impossible to bend."
6572,0,"The floor mats that I received did not have the grommet holes at the bottom of the mats, which are used to secure the mats to the floor of the car to prevent the mats from sliding and getting stuck under the gas pedal.."
158965,1,"These work great. They take all of the snow and salt and elements in the winter and gather them up away from the carpet and ultimately the floorpan of the car, saving it from the destructive (and often overlooked) effects of salt that has been ground in through the carpet and onto the metal, where it rots out and destroys the car. Very worthwhile investment."
24396,2,"Had to tape the things on to keep them with me. They need a better attachment system. Also the mirrors vibrate to the point of being useless,"
182631,2,"After reading all the positive reviews on this item I purchased it. I am not sure if I received a defective unit, but this compressor is junk. It takes 10+ minutes to fill up a 16"" car tire from 15 psi to 35 psi. I was expecting to top off tires in a couple minutes."

Although I could be mistaken, I thought I noticed an MPG improvement only 24 hours after using it.

33383,2,I applied this product to some backpacks; it took 2 cans just to do 1 backpack. My coverage and saturation were perfect and I let the product cure for 3 days instead of 2 just to be safe. I had a friend over and wanted to show off my backpacks and I took my bottle of water and poured a little on the backpack and it soaked right in. Needless to say I was embarrassed because I had bragged that the packs had this product on them to repel water. Look for another brand; don't waste your time with this one.

Not sure I can use it without buying a totally new buffer (which I really don't want to do, since I just bought one). If you already have a hook and loop wheel on your buffer, this product may be just fine."
109360,1,"Accurate tire pressure on a motorcycle is much more critical to safety than on a vehicle with four wheels. Since I had reason to doubt the accuracy of my old mechanical analog gauge, I searched for something I could have more trust in to give me accurate readings. Based on reviews of different electronic digital gauges, I conluded that the guages manufactured by Accutire were the best available. Since Amazon offered the best price and free shipping, I ordered the guage from them. The package even arrived one day earlier than expected. Kudo's to Amazon! As for the guage, it is all I expected. I like that it can be easily recalibrated to ensure accuracy too. The only problem I encountered was that the batteries were dead on arrival. But, a fresh set of batteries cured the problem. If not for the dead batteries, I'd give the product a five star rating."

Whether as a replacement part for truck or auto suspension or steering systems or as an add on item for unprotected motorcycle front forks, these boots do the job. Unlike some other manufacturter's stiff vinyl/plastic units, these Rancho units are well-made out of a flexible, almost rubber-like material. The mold seams are aligned and almost unnoticeable. As is typical, they come with ny-tie fasteners for lashing the ends to your application. This is a good product at a good price."

This is great for that reason and keeps car shining for months.CONS:Don't even think about applying in sunlight.Hard to remove from the surface.If you think you can apply it at large area and remove it later. If you want to remove it by hand , Good luck with that. Use polisher if you want to use this polish or apply to small area .When it dries, turns to hard white deposit. Hard to remove from hard to reach area because when you spray , usually you can't control where it goes. So you will have to clean it after polishing or you will end up having white spots in deep areas which are very visible if you have dark color car."

66845,0,"I've been using the AirRaid filter system for about eight years now. I have to say, all-in-all, it's a good purchase. The savings on air filters for my truck is a huge gain, especially given the number of miles I run in an average year (about 25K). It also adds a few extra horses worth of power, since the air intake was replaced to support these. So, for me, this is a big win. My only real complaint is remembering to do the maintenance on it. If you don't stay on top of it, and clean the filter every so often, you'll find that they're quite difficult to clean when the gunk has had time to set in. If you add to that my own personal laziness level, I buy a new filter every 18 months or so. Even then, it's still worth the money.I'm quite happy."

136573,1,"I installed this on my 2000 Subaru Outback while I had the engine out for a headgasket replacement. The oil pan had no gasket from the factory, but was just glued and bolted on. At the recommendation of my local mechanic shop, I installed this with a thin coat of Permatex Ultra Grey on both sides (that helped keep it in place as I bolted the pan down, and provides a little extra sealing power). Installation was easy, and the spongy nature of the cork took up the minor inconsistencies in the contact between the oil pan and the engine block.

As from my title the struts are strong enough to raise the hatch with a spoiler.

Upon examination it was clear that the design did not protect the wires from the bending and rotating allowed by the lasrs. The gage wire that was used is so thin it breaks very easily. It was broken in one place and the other wire was already set to break showing open copper to two other places. In addition, the motion sensor is fairly limited making placement difficult. The laswers also are not allowed to rotate enough to properly place the unit. They rotate backward better than forward."
92892,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
146539,0,"Like the other reviewer, I was expecting grease in a tub with a replaceable lid. Instead I received grease in a long cylinder with a pop-top lid. I'm using this for bicycles, so I'm not using very much at a time and I really wish I had a replaceable lid!"

20732,1,"Does NOT fit the 2011 Sienna. The ""make sure it fits"" applet on Amazon has it wrong. I checked the manufacturer's web site and they have the wrong info too. I called the manufacturer and verified that 192131 does not fit the 2011 Sienna. They currently don't make an in-channel one for the 2011 Sienna. Otherwise, it looks like a half decent product."
54552,1,so far so good. fully charged my maintenance free battery in less than 2 hours.I have a Honda CBR600.
51538,1,Very cool parking guide. It still works. Installation was not hard but i wish you can rotate the laser further away from each other or have the laser further apart.
114935,0,"Actually hurts to sit on until I got used to it. Now that I'm used to it... it's still not more comfortable than the seat by itself. I use it to cover up a tear in my car seat's upholstery, and it's better looking than most car seats I've seen.Maybe it'll prove it's worth once summer hits."
99569,0,"we had to modify this product to fit the way we needed it to for our chevy spectrum, kind of a pain, but they work for us..."
66231,0,"This is pretty good for removing dents, as other reviewers have commented. I would say it removes about 80% of a dent. It is better at removing circular dents than vertical dents though. There is also one big drawback... While the actual dent removal is quick, cleaning the glue from the rubber pulling nib afterwards is difficult and very time consuming, even after applying the release agent. I spent far more time just trying to get the glue off than in actually removing dents! What's worse, the yellow glue (for use between temperatures of 55 and 75 degrees) has a tendency to stick to the car surface itself, requiring a round of elbow grease to remove. Don't use this if you are queasy about your car's paint! The red glue (for use between 75 and 90 degrees) is easier to work with. Now if they could make the pulling nibs disposable and include a few dozen of them in the package, that would be a very worthwhile improvement to this product."
20386,2,So disappointed when I received the product I was excited. But when It came to install the product pads were to small. Now I find myself at Auto Zone buying brake pads while my mechanic waits for me at my garage. Thanks
94043,1,"Main reason for ordering this filter was to maybe improve MPG on a 2009 Mariner. When the hurricane hit Texas we had a fuel crisis here in Tennessee if you guys recall. You couldn't count on getting fuel and some places were charging $5.00 plus a gallon. It was fairly easy to install. Anyone with basic automotive maintainance skills can do it. After about three days of normal driving we gained an additional 0.5 MPG giving us a total of 21.3 MPG. We also gained a little additional horse power. We had hoped to gain maybe an additional 10% improvement in mileage. That's typical with high flow filters. With fuel at $5.00+ a gallon - if you can get it - every bit helps. We've been running this filter for around six weeks now. We haven't seen any additional fuel efficiency increases, but we're happy with it. Besides we won't need to buy another air filter for the life of the Mariner probably. So we will recoup the cost. I have a neighbor who puts them in all his vehicles and he reports an additional 2 - 3 MPG in his Nissan Altimas and from 2 - 5 in his diesel powered Ford trucks. I've heard some folks say that higher air flow must mean more dirt in the intake to screw with the engine. I can't say about that. But I would think that if you drive mostly on paved suburban streets like we do that's not generally a concern. If you were driving dirt roads and off roading then I might be concerned about more dirt being sucked into the engine. As far as whether I recommend this filter goes, I can only say that in our case it didn't provide the performance improvement we had hoped for, we have a brand new vehicle still 1500 miles away from first maintainance so I'm guessing that the engine is still tight and its in spec condition so we probably aren't going to see a big imporovment. The most benefit may actaully come from older (NOT NEW) vehicles. BTW: I might mention that the Mariner has the 3.0 V6 duel OHC engine. So if we can get 21.3 MPG in normal suburban driving/traffic then we are probably doing really good. I'm certain the 2000 Impala we had prior to the Mariner didn't do that well. So, I can't actively go around telling all my friends to install one of these based solely on improving mileage. I can tell you that it did make a difference of +0.5 MPG on a new V6 originally getting 20.8 MPG. So you have to decide if going from 20.8 to 21.3 MPG is worth it."
69542,0,"Product works OK if you plug in the empty cooler the night before you want to use it. Then put in the COLD beverages, cold fruit, etc immediately before you are ready to go. In that case, the cooler will keep your food cold. To do this, buy the 110/12V adapter, so you can plug the cooler in at home the night before. Then when you get to the hotel or whatever the next night, plug the cooler into the wall and let it run all night. If you do these things, the cooler will meet your expectations. If you are not prepared to do this, better use the old fashion ice cooler."

No like the wide angle one making the images look too small or too large.The bad part for this mirror are "" the mirror is too big. I hardly fully extend both sides. The extension makes you think there are more than one mirrors for you to look at.I have not try the wide angle one yet but I rather to have all in one piece than the extension one.It is a good produce anyway. Good price also.So if you do not like the wide angle one. And the one piece may too small for you then you may try this one."
81412,1,My grey leather seats in my Lexus were stained just on the sides from my dark jeans - and it cleaned off the stains in minutes!

I'm going to try it on my boyfriend's car next to see how they turn out :)
98122,2,Do not buy this part - it is absolute garbage.I bought two of these and the weld broke on both parts on first use. The weld is so weak that it almost breaks when turning with your fingers!I will go spend the $60 at Toyota to get their filter as it is worth the money and they don't break.

149861,2,"I ordered seat covers for my Mazda 5 directly from CoverKing's web site. The second and third row covers came within a couple weeks, but the front row covers took 34 days to arrive, with no explanation.Three pieces of the second and third row covers were sewn/assembled incorrectly. One seat bottom cover included two indentations for the seat belt buckle, one on each side. The rear seats have hinges to fold flat, each with both a narrow and a wide hinge - the covers came with two narrow hinge pieces on one, and two wide hinge pieces on the second. They need better quality control processes!I contacted customer support, and provided pictures of the problem areas. Customer support seems to generally take several days to respond to inquiries. Instead of offering to take care of the issue, they insisted they needed additional pictures of the car before they would do anything. After receiving the pictures, they needed several numbers from the shipping boxes, which of course had been discarded by this point. Apparently, the order number alone is not enough for them to process replacements?So, I still have three pieces that don't fit, and while they finally agreed to prioritize sewing new covers, it will be another week or two before they arrive. *If* they make the replacement covers correctly, it will have been at least 50 days from the time I placed my order, to when I finally have everything installed.On the positive side, the covers seem to fit well, except for the arm rest pieces - they're significantly baggy. No seams ripped while installing, and they're relatively easy to secure. Not sure how they'll last in the long term, but so far, spills wipe up easily."
111087,2,"Sure, it was supposed to be for my exact year/make/model and engine. and sure, it fits. But as I found out from the Hyundai dealer, it does not work properly.

168920,1,"I bought the MemoScan U581 about a year ago, and it's really gotten a lot more use than I thought it would. We have two Hondas - an 01 Civic and an 02 Accord, and since the warranties are up, I thought having a code reader might come in handy for troubleshooting purposes. I did some research, and I found this unit seemed to have a good balance of features and affordability. It gives full-text summaries of errors (not just the codes); it can also do live data captures, and its software can be updated via the manufacturer's website. I loan this out quite a bit to friends, and it's always worked with their varied vehicles. The manual could be a little better written, but it's decipherable. Overall, in my opinion, the U581 is a sophisticated diagnostic tool at a reasonable price."

181274,0,This is my first Fluke and I have been using it a while. Whie it is not a bad meter and seems to be accurate I was suprised to find that there were no fuses inside. How much do you have to spend on a fluke to get a protected meter. How do you get a Cat III rating and have no fuse protection. I bought this meter based on the Fluke reputation and I had a lot of confidece with it. Now I have a deep concern that if I put my probes in the wrong place I could do irreperible damage to it. Even my 50 dollar Extech I replaced had fuses in it.
165249,1,"So I was disappointed while reading the reviews that said the music setting didn't work. I can prove that wrong. I have a video on my facebook but I can't seem to get my profile on public. You CAN NOT run the engine while the music setting is on. The control box is sensitive to vibrations so you will have to just let the electronics run and use it for show. The installation took about half an hour but only because my car is a bit difficult when it comes to finding a flat surface under my dash. I have 2 LEDs under the front seats and 2 under the dash. I absolutely LOVE these!! Night driving is so much more fun now.Keep in mind. You have to wire this setup to the fusebox and ground the wire. It's not an Autozone 12V plug and place. I advise a fusetap for the power source. This is only $3-$5 at any auto store.Bottom line, you get WAY more than you pay for and way more than you would expect out of something of it's size. I definitely recommend these lights to EVERY auto interior designer enthusiast out there! I ordered mine on Dec 22, 2010 and got them Dec 24, 2010. ON SUPER SAVER SHIPPING!"

149206,1,"I just installed this lift hydraulic into my 1999 Jeep Cherokee. The price was convincing enough to finally replace the original lifts that haven't worked properly for years.They're easy to install, the only hiccup was the somewhat basic bulb attachment on the bottom mount. The most helpful review that I read before buying these suggested enlisting a buddy to help because you'll have to lift the heavy gate up pretty high to get the lift to attach.I arrogantly scoffed at the reviewer as being overly cautious, disregarding his tribulation about the old broom stick he'd been using to prop his lift gate open, falling out. I got the first lift on without any problems, other than the clip. I reveled in my man-ness as I moved to the other, I was soon to find out, better working lift. I removed the original lift and quickly attached the new lift to the post and quickly snapped the clip over. Final step, bolt on two bolts. I raised the lift a little higher to make room to align the holes. This action was apparently just enough to let the 4' long 2x4 I'd been using to support the lift gate, to fall out and crash into my big toe, while simultaneously letting the new lift hydraulic to hit me in the head.Get a buddy to help, it'll be worth the beer or two, you could probably do it during half time.Love the product, the new hydraulics raise the gate all by themselves! Really easy, even with a hurt toe, scraped face and bruised ego."

Not that I totally disagree with what has been said about the product, but I will say that for the money this impact gun is actually not all that bad. Face it, it's only rated for a touch over 200 ft lb of torque - I have another impact gun in my tool box that easily hits 3 1/2 times that - and in the 1/2 in. drive world, there are impact wrenches that can even exceed 800 ft lb... So if you were expecting a pit crew quality gun for this price, you were sadly mistaken. However, I will tell you that this gun has shattered a pulley-puller that I had, so it at least was able to produce enough torque to do that (yes, the puller was made of impact-grade steel... well, that's what the manual said anyway). Bottom line, for removing lug nuts or other smaller stubborn bolts, this gun will suffice fine. Yes - it will remove lug nuts like they were finger-tight... If someone says it can't remove a lug nut, they are torquing their lug nuts WAY too tight. Time to buy a torque wrench or you'll be snapping a lug soon. Just don't expect it to be the go-to gun when you encounter that 20 year old corroded nut holding your rear leaf spring on. It's probably not going to do much but make noise and frustrate you. But it's got its place in the tool box. Like the previous reviewers said - you get what you pay for. If you want a Thunder Gun, prepare to pay at least 5x the price. If you want a beginner-level gun, then this is where you can start. Cheers!"
19955,0,"They fit the seat okay, the order also came with some arm rest covers but my Titan does not have armrests? There is no cover for the center box as shown in the picture but it is not listed in the description either so whatever custom..."

125135,2,"Plastic surrund is thin/flexible, and it doesn't appear or feel well made. Also, the screws that mount it to the windshield frame contact the frame, which will cause scratching and marring. It's going back and I'm going back to CIPA."
30195,2,I Bought These filters for a 2002 Suzuki 800 Marauder VZ-800.They Do Not Fit. You can not put high flow filters on this bike. I strugled for mounths trying to adjust the carb but it was imposable. Finaly I had to spend more money and buy OEM filters. Don't wast your money If You have a Suzuki VZ-800.
178673,0,This is an ok wiper although it took me forever to get it on my 2000 rav4.Had to get a friend to help me.
185766,2,its ok. I thought this was way better than the regular one but its the same thing just different bottling. i tried blue magic metal polish cream and its makes my aluminum rims look way better and in half the time. For any one considering this i suggest the blue magic. I got got a buddy that suggested to me mothers to switch to blue magic
138103,2,So apparently it doesnt fit trucks so dont buy it if your looking to fit it in your truck. It ripped as we were installing it and stretched entirely off the steering wheel within a month. No good
176221,0,"Let me begin by saying this is NOT a flare and it does not produce the light you get from a flare, BUT, it is a nice little gadget to have and it serves its purpose well. It is comparable to a small red flashlight but better. Read on . . .About the size and weight of a glo-stick, the gizmo measures 5 1/2 "" long and is about 1/2 "" in diameter. It is basically plastic with a magnet in the tip. The ""Flameless Flare"" is re-usable by simply replacing the two AAA batteries that come with the gizmo when they wear out. The package claims that the ""superbright flashing red ""LED"" light is visable at 1000 feet, is weatherproof, and will burn for 250 hours continuous use. It functions as an emergency flasher and map light. The LED light never burns out, simply replace the batteries (vs. the highway flare that burns out in 15 minutes). The magnet at the base will allow you to position it on the hood of the car."" The gizmo comes to us from Bellingham, WA, USA.As I said, it's a pretty nice little product to have in your car's emergency kit. You might want about 4 of them. I played with it out in the dark and you could see it pretty well. The red light is bright enough. Since it is only 180 degrees, instead of 360 degrees, you have to point it toward what you want to see you. (The red light is about 1 "" tall by 1 1/2 "" wide.) There is a button on the side to make it flash, show continuous red light, or turn it off. The magnetic feature allows you to attach it (although I am not sure if a Mac truck would not blow it off as it whizzes past you). It has an ""eye"" at the end that you could hook a cord through or a key circle, and maybe attach your own hooks/clamps to it.)I thought the ""map light"" thing was a bit of a stretch. Although you COULD use it to read a map, and a red light is better than no light, it doesn't really provide very good light for map reading. Do understand--this is more of a light that allows others to see YOU. It doesn't really provide much light for you to see something else. (For example--if your power goes out in the house, you need a flashlight or a candle.)You can use this gizmo for all kinds of things: car, boat, camping, home, RV, hunting, fishing, etc. You could use it to help you find someone in the crowds on the Ocean City, Maryland Boardwalk, or in a crowded concert at Oregon Ridge. You could hang one on your child's backpack or bike.As I said, it is good enough to be seen pretty well--1000 feet is probably correct. You can use it over and over again and it seems safe enough for a child to use (because it is comparable to a small flashlight with a magnet).Although this product is nice as it is, to the manufacturer of this product, I would suggest a wider base and a longer and wider light. I would also suggest a circular key ring be attached to the eyehole and a detachable cord with a clamp/hook on each of the 2 ends. That would enhance this product and it could be securely clipped anywhere.It has tons of uses - Halloween is coming, too.PS--If I had 12 kids, they each would have one of these gizmos. (I would be Bellview, but they each would have one.)"
61934,1,"This product is very durable, perfect size, and very lightweight. I love it. Very simplistic and very reliable."
43868,1,I didn't have to read the directions. The unit is plug and play. It is inexpensive for the amount of it's capabilities. The software gives a short description of the fault. Details of the fault are easily found online. I highly recommend this item.
66366,0,"I am still experimenting with this product. First time I used it the product flaked off in 3 days. I am following instructions but it is no adhering. I did read online that product needs rust to adhere so I let it rust up again and will try again with the One-Step Rust Converter Primer Sealer, 10 oz. aerosol."

I had a few very strange very hard shifts at first but now it is as smooth as butter. Smooth shifts, no problems. Try it, I am sure if your transmission is to worn this may not work, but worth a try."

68432,2,"This cup holder doesn't work very well for my needs. When installed, you can only pull up on the parking brake about 1 or 2 clicks (not really enough to engage it). If you accidentally pull up too much, the screws break through the plastic (washers would probably fix that problem). But also, the holders are not really wide and deep enough to hold much more than a 12oz can. And if the can is full or your cup is taller, expect your drink to fall on your lap, or in my case, the passenger's lap. 2 stars out of 5 because it looks and works as advertised. Just not for me."
183975,1,Good quality for the price. I did have to replace drain cock valve seal with larger seal due to poor sealing and caused leak. But other than that it is good product.
113130,1,"I know to some people this necklace may sound like a load of garbage but for me it works. I bough one of these 15 months ago and I never take it off because I work in front of computers all the time and also carry a cell phone. No matter your profession, we are all exposed to EMF's from just about anything that runs off electricity (television, computer, cell phones, alarm clock, wireless networking equipment, etc.,).The government tells us we are safe from it all, but when was the last time you could trust the government for the truth. Anyway, there is no 15 month placebo effect and it's not like I sit around and think about how great my Qlink is everyday. In fact I never think about it to be honest. The one thing the Qlink has done for me is that I have not been sick since I started wearing it. That's right, no common colds for 15 months. Before wearing my Qlink I would get sick at least twice if not three or four times a year. I can't begin to tell you how nice it is to not have been sick in so long!If you care to know why, it's quite simple really. EMF's mess up your body's natural frequency. This can cause multiple health issues, but one of them is that your white bloods cells become mutated and inefficient. The Qlink aides in making your body's EMF stronger. This will protect you from harmful EMF's and will allow your white blood cells to stay healthy, which just so happen to be your immune systems first line of defense. I admit that perhaps I am a minority when it comes to the effects on my immune system, but I know the Qlink made the difference.[...](P.S.)I know this necklace is peddled to golfers, I can't attest to those claims but the overall health benefits are well worth the money, plus there is a lifetime warranty!"
49332,0,"I was skeptical of this carrier because of the price. I read all the reviews specifically to see if the bag really was waterproof. After reading all the positive comments, I decided to purchase it. The bag itself was very large, we have a mini-van and 4 children. We were able to put 4 small/medium suitcases in the carrier. So for size it gets 5 stars. We were traveling from Northern Kentucky to Maine. We stayed overnight in New York and had to take it off the top because security reasons. I would give it 3 stars for ease of installation. The straps were a little difficult to tighten. Now the main thing I was concerned about was the keeping our suitcases dry....on the way to Maine, we hit little rain and it was very light. Everything stayed dry. On the way home it was a different story...we hit heavy pockets of rain and 3 of our 4 suitcases were wet. The top few layers of clothes in each suitcase were wet as well. For waterproof I would give it 1 star.If you know your travels will include little rain, I suggest this carrier for the size and price. If you might hit rain...I would say shop for another carrier."

160464,1,"I wanted a windshield for my bike that reduced the wind on my chest and acted as a bug shield on my morning commutes. This works great for that. It also substantially reduces wind gust buffeting and it has improved my gas mileage by at least 5 mpg. A very pleasant surprise. The windshield and quick-release mounting hardware are very well made and the install was easy. The windshield can be removed and reinstalled in seconds. I don't like the look of windshields, so I wanted a quick release system so I could cruise after work and on weekends without one. This looks so good though that I have no need to remove it. Oh yeah, did I mention that it has SUBSTANTIALLY increased my gas mileage. It will easily pay for itself in less than a year."

147913,0,"This mobile office product works well for general organization while you're on the road. I was disappointed in how hard it is to move, and keep everything in tact. There is the straps/strings that hang off, and it doesn't zip closed. When not in use, it is very bulky and akward. I also found that the seller sent the product directly in the box, and my product was bent and damaged. I didn't bother to contact the seller about it, as the cost of returning it for another wasn't worth it to me. I thought is was an ok solution for the mobile office, just not user friendly to move around."
145219,0,"For the looks alone it gets 3 stars. For the rest 3 stars as well. For the price I would say I have no regrets. I been using it hanging on the blinker handle on my car. Barely fitted and it is small enough to where you can not see it but it also was kind of hard to fit in that place. The other options like hang it from a head rest with the belt they issued did not appeal to me. I thought it would be better if it was inconspicuous from the world at large. The inside is quite small, enough to throw a few kleenex? wrappers, etc., and empty when no more can fit. Really a 3.5 for what it is supposed to do but for looks probably more. Who knows? I might get to like it more and more and if my life is so uneventful that I feel compelled to update this review then perhaps I will. In the meantime 3 Stars for the Cool looking, Silly little pouch!"
176532,1,"Own a Honda CR-V & an Accord. Both notable for the amount of road noise transferred inside vehicle, making conversation & music listening difficult.Purchased Dynamat when replacing the V's speakers [new ones - Polk DB651's-Polk Audio DB651 6.5-Inch Coaxial Speakers (Pair, Silver). Did not encase entire door. Covered speaker install areas completely, then applied strips & patches to metal areas around door frame. Also placed Dynamat under carpet under rear seats. Placed another type of sound deadening media in trunk & spare tire area. Sound difference is amazing. Will probably redo entire rear area with Dynamat. Took me about 5 hours to change speakers & Dynamat doors & under seat.On the Accord, also replaced speakers [new ones - Alpine SPS-17c2's] following same procedure as with V. In addition, removed trunk liner & spare. Covered floor pan & side walls. Also covered rear shelf from underneath, along with bracing struts. Sound difference in the Accord is more amazing. The more thorough Dynamat coverage has created a much more quiet car. Took me about 9 hours to do Accord speaker replacement & Dynamat coverage.Some advice about the install process. 1.] Buy a trim removal kit, such asActron CP5011 Panel, Trim and Molding Removal Set. Makes removing interior panels & other trim pieces much easier & neater. Can also use curved pieces to roll down Dynamat to insure tight fit. 2.] be sure where you want to place your Dynamat. Once applied & rolled down, you can't move it without making a black, sticky mess. 3.] might think about using gloves when applying Dynamat. Sharp metal edges & bare skin don't go well together. 4.] much safer to cut Dynamat with it lying flat on the ground.All in all, a great purchase. Can listen to music in both vehicles with volume level between 10-15. Road noise is now muted at much lower levels than before. Highly recommendDynamat 10455 Xtreme Bulk Pack 9 Sheetsto anyone with minimal mechanical skills who want a quieter car"

62262,0,"Made nicely, but when I received it brand new light did not work. Its still going to be used, but the light option is sort of what sparked my interest. It does have the option of unscrewing the bottom and replacing the round lithium battery, but since I just bought it I should not have to!! The inside cup pulls out which is nice to empty and clean. Good buy, but darn that light. Lol. UPDATE after time passed...I ended up buying one that works at Target, the light still works to this day, so I never really actually used this blue one. If I had more people in the car smoking, Ill still be happy I have an extra one lying around:-)"

Hard for me to tell, because once this stuff starts to get cracks or deep grooves/wrinkles, it pretty much stays that way.

184164,0,"Based on this sway bar's excellent reputation, I bought one to address the ""head bob"" sensation my stock 2002 ""overland"" (with upcountry suspension) WJ has.In the factory configuration, there is a thick sway bar up front and a comically small sway bar in the rear, so when encountering uneven pavement the vehicle body ""follows"" the front axle exclusively, causing left/right rolling sensations that shake passengers uncomfortably side to side.I had hoped that this Addco 1"" sway bar would serve to match the front axle's sway bar & cause an averaging of ""roll"" when the front or rear axle encounters uneven pavement, but it seems to be so stiff that now the body follows the rear axle's cue, basically being just as uncomfortable as it was before. There is no doubt that the vehicle feels ""tighter"" now, but I definitely cannot call this a net improvement as it did not actually correct the problem it was intended to address.I think there's a 7/8"" diameter version of this available, which might be a smarter option."

What more can you ask for at only $45ish dollars?Some constraints:1. the fan is very loud. on an airplane, people won't really notice since the cabin is loud anyway. the fan is loud in the car unless people converse loudly.2. the device does give off an odd smell.3. when using a powerful laptop and depending on the airplane yr, make, model, etc..., you might have to remove its battery. if you don't, the power source (at least on the airbus 330) will cut off every 5 secs."

They give you two plugs for them but the third hole is just there so i had to make my own plug. Another little problem is that on the manual it says; NOTE : LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA FOR RACING CARS ON A SPEEDWAY AND NOT FOR CARS THAT WILL EVER BE DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAY. Yet they give you the little plate saying its CARB exempt. So its illegal but it will still pass the smog test. I don't know but I'm a bit disappointed."

Simple to install - MAYBE 5 minutes, if you go slow. Just clean the window track, scuff it (they supply a small scuffing pad), clean it again with alcohol wipes (also supplied), peel the covering off the adhesive, and stick 'em in the slot.The directions talk about a fancy way of ""peeling the ends loose, installing the vent visor, then pulling the ends to remove the adhesive covering"". Not necessary, IMO. As long as you've cleaned & scuffed the track well, and can give it 24 hrs to cure after putting them on.I had these on my last pickup. I bought my son a set for his car.

73856,1,"I don't usually write reviews, but this one is deserving.The stock filter has foam around the periphery to seal it. The K&N; filter uses a rubber wedge / protrusion, and fit very tight in the slot. Definitely use the supplied lube to install it. Seals really well.Also noticed the engine vibrations decreased slightly with my 2010. Vibs from the handlebars when cruising in 6th gear at 60 MPH dropped. Now I don't feel that level of vibration unless I drop to 4th gear at that speed. Sweet! Also, the sale price was only $11 more than a replacement stock filter, and this one is a lifetime filter!Shipping was super fast too. I ordered it on a Friday with the 5 to 8 day free shipping option, and received it on Monday (3 days later). Very happy with this purchase. Even posted about it on two major forums, and dozens of members bought them (Hey, maybe I get a commission here :) )."

63870,0,"I tried it on my 2002 Suburban, 2000 Ford F-150, and my 2005 VW Jetta. It links up with all these vehicles and gave me the powertrain codes that were set on the 'Burb. The features outside of the basic scan and live data are not very easy to access. The user interface could be a lot more easier to navigate. If you buy one, plan on reading the manual. It doesn't seem to read anything other than the P codes (powertrain) so if you are trying to troubleshoot other anomolies with your car or truck, you're outta luck here. Of course you can buy the $100 upgrade to get the ABS codes if that's a problem. The other gripe I have is the Live Data mode. There is no way to have the unit connected to the vehicle and to a PC at the same time to assist with troubleshooting. The screen is small and hard to read for an old geezer like myself (48). The marketing literature seems to suggest it does a lot more than it really does, like the body codes. It does work so I gave it three stars, but I feel the advertising is misleading. Record and playback is a pain. I would much rather log the data in a file on my laptop and then examine it in Excel or MATLAB or other more useful interface. It's fairly inexpensive and you get what you pay for."
164559,1,Just what I needed. My car had problems staying on. I found out it was the ignition switch. I replaced it so now my car stays on. It came earlier than expected. So I rate this a 5
103608,0,"While I bought these because of the brand and that they were an OEM product, how can I truly evaluate them for durability or any other factor? They do last a long time and don't squeek. Easy to install. Wish there was some way to have real DATA to evaluate brake pads. I gave it 3 stars only because it is hard to compare brake pads. To me, the pluses as mentioned already were: ease of installation, material of ceramic (which as I've read on the web is better than other materials), brand name, and OEM relationship."

56873,1,"I own two sets of these gloves, one set for work and one set for home. At home I do minimal DIY work, so the gloves don't get a lot of wear on them, just dirty from time to time. At work they get their maximum test, as I do inspections on Helicopters; this often involves putting my hands in places where safety wire isn't correctly installed, fuel is pooled, engine and transmission oil has leaked, and jagged metal is hiding just waiting to cut my hands. The gloves routinely get snagged and filthy during my inspections. I have yet to get an actual tear in these gloves, and they have been through the washer several times while still maintaining their integrity.I very much enjoy the fact that these gloves slip on and do not have to be adjusted via strap. They are an amazing fit and allow a great deal more manual dexterity than I've experienced with other gloves.ProsVery well madeEasy to wash / Hang dryFit well, retain manual dexterityNo adjust strap.Keep hands warm in cold weather, but not too hot in warm weatherConsNone"

105261,0,"Hey All, this is your very basic black shift ball. I ordered it based on cost and ""basic-ness"" seemed to fit the bill and it is a Hurst (not that it matters. I guess i give it a three because it is pretty small and just looks weird on my shifter. No where on this site or on the manufactures site did it state that it is approximately an inch and a half in diameter. Nor does it have any logo engraved as the description says. I dont know, car i bought has a kind of ugly billet shift knob on it but i dont think i can use this, probably end up missing the shifter half the time."
178772,0,"I bought 2 sets of these blades: one for my 03' IS300 and one for my girlfriend's 99' Integra. These blades wipe clean except for a streak of water left behind on my 22"" blade (driver side). The streak of water left behind is about 1"" wide and near the center of the blade. The water eventually wipes away after several passes but it is a bit annoying to see such ""wonderful"" wiper blades work this way. At first I thought I might have a defective product but I learned that my girlfriend's wipers do the same thing! Her driver side blade is also 22"". Hopefully the wipers just need time to break in but the passenger side wiper blades (20"" and 18"") work perfectly. Perhaps I was sold 2-22"" blades from an entire ""batch"" of defective ones. Either way, I am not completely satisfied with the purchase (I am 50% satisfied to be exact - 2 out of 4 wipers work perfectly).Edit: I guess they needed some time to break in, they have been working perfect for almost a year now. These are the only blades I will buy now.Second Edit: I feel obligated to update on the durability of these. I've had them for ~15 months and they are about to be replaced. While they are still marginally acceptable, they don't wipe as clean and they now chatter too much. I keep my windshield well maintained so that is not the issue. For my application, I've concluded that these are no better than any other silicone blades. I intend to try Triple Edge silicone blades for ~$7-8 each at Walmart since I've heard they perform pretty well. Another economical alternative is to buy the cheap &lt;$3 Pylon brand at Walmart and replace every 6 months are so. They work great for at least that long and price is right."
160749,0,"The compressor on this unit, like so many others this small, is really only made for pumping up toys or bicycle tires. So don't buy this unit for that purpose. Go to a gas station with quarters and use their air vender.If, like me, you bought a used unit, you will need to get both the manual and the charger. Do a search on servicenet dewalt to find the owners manual. The manual is a download pdf. Charger model number is 514005-42.Hope this helps. It's really a neat little device to have around. I especially like the built-in LED flashlight.You really NEED to read the manual all the way through. The special sealed type battery requires charging at least every 60 days or it WILL go bad quickly."

3185,1,"These filters were recommended on the ""gadgets"" site for Kawasaki 1500 classic custom air intake. I decided to try it and they work great with the simple modifications described on the ""gadgets"" site. Anyone pondering weather to try it needs to know that they absolutely have to re-jet their carburetor because of the vast increase in airflow of air, my bike ran extremely lean before re-jetting,a top speed of about 80 mph. would damage engine top end without the jet kit. I like the new look and sound but actual performance increase is minimal at best, it did increase top speed by about 7 mph. The chrome finish is very good and they are very light weight making them ideal for this application because of the vibration of the typical V twin (if they were heavier the vibration would be amplified causing fatigue on the intake system)."

In other words, when I program the one I purchased, the original gets de-programmed and visa versa. I can't get them both to work at the same time. I googled 4 different methods of programming and it's the same with all methods. I had a few people try it with the same results.

I bought them, after all, so I could take them off and wash them and save wear and tear on my car's seats. Anyway, they were a pain to put on -- I think they're really too short to put on a car with normal headrests (I have a Subaru Forester). Anyway, I got home and looked at the box again. There it says DO NOT USE SEAT COVER ON SEATS WITH AN AIR BAG! What is up with that! Who doesn't have air bags these days? And why isn't this included in the information about the product before it's purchased? Hmmmm."

111591,1,"First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.I wont be using it for 50,000 miles but I know it works as I have used it in the past.

So its keeps your air filter working like new for 150,000 miles and filter has a million mile warranty so buy again after product is used up."

1547,1,The unit arrived in a timely manner.The fit & finish are correct for a 1994 Dakota.I only replaced one that was broken and the new unit matches the original on the other side just fine.
99657,2,"OK. This is VERY important. This unit does NOT output a real sine-wave when on DC power. The output is a chopped up ""sine-wave"" which drops to zero volts many times over a single wavelength. This unit does NOT play nicely with most furnace or pellet stove blowers, certainly not my 1/6 HP blower on my Lennox furnace. NOWHERE IN THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION does it say that the output on DC power is a ""PWM sine wave output"". However, if you go to the Tripp Lite website, find this product and go to the specifications tab, this is what you will find:LINE POWER (AC): Maintains 120V nominal sine wave output from line power source. INVERTER POWER (AC): Maintains PWM sine wave output voltage of 120 V AC (+/-5%).Freaking great. So much for ""clean, computer grade power"". That is a load of B.S., honestly. If I had known, for even a second, that this unit didn't output a real sine wave, I would have purchased something else. Apparently, you have to get theTRIPP LITE APS1012SW 1000 Watt 12 Volt Inverter / Charger Pure Sine Wave 120 Volt 4A/40A Hardwireat approximately TRIPLE the cost to get a real sine wave output on DC power. So now I'm stuck with this thing, as I bought this thing, then researched batteries, then got that, then tested the setup out on stuff besides my furnace, then had to modify the wiring to/from my furnace by cutting it and putting an outlet in one box, and a power cord in another, so I could insert this setup in between furnace and mains power, and thus it's been more than 30 days. Nor will Tripp Lite help me, as it ""clearly"" says in the specifications that this is a PWM output on DC power. They will allow me to trade up to the 1012SW if I pay the difference in RETAIL prices.So, yippee. Just dandy. If you buy this, make sure that you test it out within the return time on the actual equipment you want to backup power. And if you have a pellet stove, chances are it won't work according to what the Tripp Lite representative told me.[EDIT]***FIVE STARS TO AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!***So I called Amazon mainly to tell them that they should add the PWM output on DC info to the product page, but also with the slim hope that they might be able to do something for me. And they WERE able to do something for me! I couldn't be more pleased with Amazon. This is precisely why I always try to buy from Amazon when I can![/EDIT]"
153551,0,"This product is suitable for a replacement of the factory part. For my 1990 Miata, it is slightly shorter than the factory part. It has a sight glass built in but the sight glass on my part was painted over but the paint was easily scraped away. The part was sealed from outside air during shipping. I am satisfied with the product. The price was much lower than local auto parts outlets."
149078,1,"Easy to hook-up and works well. Power indicator light is helpful to know the unit has power. My only complaint is the cord is too short. Yes, extension cords can be used but another 3' of cord would be nice. Be aware that the units are not waterproof and if they get wet, they will stop working."

Monroe recommended that the reflex shocks be used on front with the load adjusting shocks in back. Changed them over, a much rougher ride, but I think the truck is sitting higher. I bought the high performance monotube version, thinking that it would improve the ride. Rides stiff, but I can probably handle a lot more weight and I'm sure it is more suitable for off road use."

42644,0,"It does indeed glow a brilliant blue after letting it sit in the sun for hours. It lasts only 4-5 hours not the advertised 8. During daylight it appears anywhere from a light splotchy yellow to a deep vibrant yellow depending on what type/color light it was being ""charged"" under. The can says it can cover about 10-12 square feet but I discovered it only covers around 2-3 if you are lucky and spray lightly. The can also tends to clog up while spraying and takes some work to get working again. Overall I am rather disappointed by the daytime appearance and the lack of paint in the can. It is almost worth the very nice glow it can give off during nighttime (very bright actually) but not quite.Also, be sure to use a white primer before you paint with this stuff or your glow will be dull.UPDATE:Well it's been a few months and the glowing effect has been reduced to almost nothing. I can be in my garage with the lights out and the windows blocked and hold a 10 million candlepower spot light to this paint for 10 minutes and it /barely/ glows. UV lights don't help either. The dim glow it does give off now lasts for around 5-10 minutes. Worthless."

Works great, and I've ended up using it on my car and in my bathroom.The wide blade makes clearing the condensation from my windows very quick, and since it's flexible, it conforms to the shape of the window. It also makes it easy to clear off condensation from side-view mirrors, which is hard to do with standard squeegees."

I use regular queen sheets instead of buying the shorter sheets recommended for this mattress and they work fine. I was surprised that it came rolled up like a sausage. It is heavy, so when you take it out of the box, follow the directions to the letter and do not open the plastic until you get it where you want it.

It was listed for my 2003 Taurus, but the compressor only has a 4.5&#34; pulley, so that means I either had to play games figuring out a belt length that would fit (for the life of the car), or replace the pulley on the bracket. I found a 38024 ACDelco/Gates pulley fit fine, and so the original belt fits, but the pulley cost me another $30 and wasted time.Just another perfect example of how Dorman thinks up great ideas, but manages to screw it up in the details/manufacturing."

I don't know how anyone could ride very long like this. My ears are ringing after a mile or so.That being said, this helmet looks much better than most of the half-helmets I tried on. The straps are almost too short, but I am able to make it work."
110787,0,"I admit, I've never used one of these pin pullers before, until now. Coming from an aviation background in the military, I've seen plastic versions of tools like this, and I realize there are individual pins inside connectors but didn't give it much thought on the different types of catch mechanisms inside. Trying to find the correct tool for the right sized pin is key. That's why I bought two different types of terminal tools. When I first tried to remove a stuck pin in a connector for my 69 Mustang, I used the larger hollow side that fit. Because the pin was stuck I had to move the tool around quite a bit and when I applied a little too much force, the tube buckled. I was disappointed in the quality and how quickly it buckled but I guess that's what I get for being a knuckle dragging jet engine mech. I suppose if I had cute little avionicsman fingers, I would have realized I needed another version of this tool to use. Luckily I bought two of these because the other tool worked great."

99086,2,"First off, would like to say that my 2009 Scion XB had a pretty good case of mold due to the drain line getting clogged this hot summer, and me not knowing what to do about it (From everything I have read online, this seems to be a problem with Toyta products... too bad I found this out too late in the game!). When I finally figured out how to get the water out, the evaporator was pretty infested with mold. I tried this product, and followed the directions to the letter. Unfortunately, the only thing that happened is that it masked the mold smell for about 2-3 weeks. Looks like I'm going to have to take the car to the dealer or a repair shop, have them disassemble the whole system, and clean it out with bleach to get all th mold out. Don't waste your money if your mold problem is bad!"
128676,1,"This bike rack was easy to assemble. Aside from use in my truck, it is also a good bike rack for storing our bicycles in the garage. My only complaint is that it will not hold the bikes up on its own in the truck bed. I needed to purchase additional tie downs to secure the bikes. It would be nice if it came with straps to secure the bikes in the truck bed."
98599,2,I tried to use the Jack to change the tires a Nissan 200SX race car. It worked for about 2 months then it would not even lift 100 pounds. So figure about 12 - 16 tire changes. I guess I should have never used it for anything other than changing lawn mower blades and bought a real jack to lift a light weight car. Well off the scrap yard to dump this POS off.

137566,0,I bought this because it's a reasonable price for neoprene seat covers. When they came in I really liked their feel and they were easy to install. But I discovered I only got the 2 seat covers and the console cover was missing. I contacted Amazon who promptly shipped me out a new set.

After spending hours switching buffing pads on my 6 inch buffer/grinder, I decided that having a dedicated buffer with two pads for different compouds was a good idea. The 8 inch discs are much faster and better and the machine works very well. It makes a huge difference."
55337,2,"I just re-read the description, and the above seat cover description is a gross misrepresentation. It incorrectly, if not fraudulently indicates that the covers were customized to fit my specific model. The covers are a sloppy fit, especially on the passenger side, and the controls that are not completely covered are available only through wide sloppy generic openings obviously made to account for any number of general configurations."

177948,1,Nice product with powdercoating on edge. Too bad it is now made in China. Amazon parts ordering is somewhat clunky. Had to go to the Raybestos web site to get the part number for my 1997 T-Bird Sport. Amazon said part would not fit but it does.

162904,0,"I'd give the product 5 stars but for the failure to disclose how much of a pain the installation is. The product description says it is ""no drill installation,"" which led me to believe I'd walk out, plop it on the ground at the back of the Element, bolt it up and be done. The first step in the instructions, however, is to enlarge one hole on each side of the frame. I don't know how everyone else did this, because the holes aren't in a place where they can be reached with a drill. The holes only need about an extra 1/32"" of radius to accommodate the bolts and spacers. After about 20 minutes with a grinder stone on my Dremel, I'd begun to wish I'd just hooked up the torch. The little fish-tape tool is totally cool. The hitch is solid, the fit is tight, and it looks good on the car. Bought it with Amazon Prime and it shipped quickly and arrived in a box darn near big enough to put the whole car in."

5194,1,"I get a very nice spark with this plug on my 67 Mini Cooper. It keeps clean requiring little maintenance. I did need to gap it so make sure you have a gapping tool - they are very inexpensive.I'm unsure why this is called a ""Pack of 1"", and so for the sake of clarity - you get a single plug with the order and not the box of 4 that you sometimes see in stores.Very satisifed with the purchase. Prime eligible makes this very affordable."
21433,0,"I like the look, size, and price of this item. However, it's made of the thinnest metal I've ever seen, the chrome plating begins to chip as soon as you take it out of the package, and the bolts are damn near impossible to get in once you have the pedal attached to the cover. I used double sided 3M tape to get a better seal and it seems strong.The pedal looks great, but I would gladly pay double for one made of thicker metal with a higher quality chrome finish."
179017,0,"Firstly, I really liked the size weight and shape. The finish wasn't flawless. I bought this for my late 80's mitsubishi pick-up. Despite having 3 different thread sizes, none fit. I also tried to give it away and it didn't fit on a Nissan 240sx. Once you secure threaded insert inside it's not coming out so be careful with that. Really wish it fit."
86696,0,"Despite the fact that the directions were a bit confusing, I was able to install it in about 2 hours. The product works as expected - I have seen about a 1 mpg improvement in fuel efficiency, but it is definitely a bit noisier, though not to the point of being intolerable. One of the O-rings was missing so rather than break down, send back and re-install, it's just easier to go to my favorite hardware store and buy another o-ring."
178705,2,"I purchased these during the 2 for 1 deal because I had great success with them on my previous vehicle, a Mazda. Those worked fantastic from early 2008 until 2010 when I sold it. These latest units from Amazon came in an improved package. The frame seemed to be of slightly better quality than the older ones, however the ultimate issue was the blade. There was some sort of graphite goo ALL over the blade. I installed these on my brand new truck with a perfectly clean windshield and in anything but a complete downpour they made HORRIBLE screaching sounds, as well as leaving a smeared mess of that graphite goo throughout the wiper range.I gave them a few days and nothing improved, and I had to keep breaking out my Meguiars 10:1 glass cleaner and clean the damn windows of that goo. I finally had it, removed them and wiped the blades with alcohol to remove the goo as thoroughly as possible. I figured at that point they would be just like the Silblades i had a few years ago. Nope, still noisy as heck! I tried to call the number for Silblade and continually got the voice mail for customer service. Finally a couple days later someone called me back but by that point I already sent these pieces of crap back to Amazon for a refund."
1724,1,"This product is very well made. Good quality and value.There are a three features in particular that I find very useful.First, it's charging system is literally plug-in and forget. It maintains a full charge at all times and you do not need disconnect it from AC power ever. It's circuits determine the need for charging if and when required. It's always ready for use whenever you need itSecond, it has a built-in meter that tells you the state of charge(as a percentage) while using it. Think of it as a fuel gauge.Third, the built in meter tells you the wattage draw of whatever you have plugged in to it. Knowing the current draw when plugging in more than one thing can be most useful. This makes using it pretty much foolproof.The manual that comes with the product is well written, easy to understand, and complete.I've always had good experiences with other Xantrex products."

55285,0,"I bought these over a year ago, but decided to wait before I posted a review. The shocks arrived intact, with no signs of damage. The expansion ties were still on, keeping the piston compressed until I was ready to install them.On my '05 2500, the dampening on the front shocks isn't quite as good as the Mopar shocks when they were new. Mopar has quite a few different part numbers, depending on your truck's build code and which front springs it has. My truck has the snow plow prep package, and a diesel engine. So, these shocks feel a little softer than the originals did. In fact, these shocks are listed for more applications than I would have expected. For example, a diesel engine adds a lot more weight to the front end than a gas engine. However, the dampening has remained consistent over the last 15 months. Living in the Northeast, I pre-sprayed mine with a protective coating, then a black coat of paint over that to help reduce rusting. They are still in good shape in that respect.I gave 3 stars because I feel these are average, and of no real benefit over other after-market ""stock"" shocks, including Monroe's Gas-Magnum shock. I was expecting a more firm ride from the Reflex line of shock absorber."

157371,1,"I purchased this today and used it on a 1995 Acura Integra with the original Milano Red paint. The car had not been polished or waxed in over 5 years, but was washed around every 2 months. The hood showed oxidation as did the spoiler but all other areas were still glossy. The vehicle has a ton of scratches and has been keyed over the years. I did not know what to expect when I used this product. I had figured the hood to be at a point of no return. I applied the product with an applicator by hand with long straight strokes. After I covered the desired area, I wiped it clean with a soft microfiber cloth. I decided to do the entire vehicle and followed up with a wax. It took me about 2 hours. I am very pleased with the product. It restored a natural lustre to the hood, bringing it to the near glossy finish on the front fenders and sides. I figure with an electrical buffer, I could have gotten even a deeper clean of the hood as I can still see some oxidation.Some say that this product is too potent, resulting in swirls or streaks. I think this may be true on finishes that are already pretty good. In my case, the paint was already weathered and chalky, and being original paint, I think it is more durable than non-OEM paint and stands up better to polishing compounds."

183444,2,"I purchased one of these cans a few weeks ago, and the can did not come with a straw, despite the instructions telling you to put the straw in the nozzle and all pictures on the can showing this mythical straw.I tried a number of straws from various other products, but all of them were too large or too small to work with the nozzle of this product.I surely thought that this was a mistake and the straw had simply fallen off before shipping. There's even tape on the can where it seems like a straw would normally be placed, so I purchased another can recently in the hope of using that straw for both.When that can arrived, it too had no sign of the legendary straw.Now my only solution is to attempt to find replacement straws online, quite a hassle to go through to get a tiny piece of plastic.I have a nagging feeling that the people who are reviewing this product bought it in a store and not off Amazon, because the thing I received is totally useless."
173361,0,"I bought this charger more than a month ago. The box that it came in was in excellent condition. But when I opened the package and looked at the charger, the item was damaged. I thought of returning it but the fact was I had an urgent job that needed this 24V charger. Apart from the damaged outer casing, I found that the leads were getting very warm each and every time. So I am not too sure that it is working the way that it should.There is no on and off switch and the only way to achieve this is by pulling out the plug. I have another Charger from the company and it works just great. I just felt that I got a yellow lemon with the purchase of this item. Such is life. The most appealing thing about this charger is that it is portable. I would continue to purchase products from this company in the future."
128449,0,"I bought these for my 98 m3 4 door, they are working fine but I was disappointed with the price and fitment. There are two studs available for each of the roof rack mounts and these clips only use one of the studs. I bought my Yakima rack used, and it came off of a jetta with Q103 clips. The Q103 clips actually used both studs for each mount but the bend in the clip was slightly off and I want to have the correct fitment. It would have been nice if the Q18 clips used both available studs, and remember the package includes 2 clips, you will need 2 packages (4 clips) to fit your car."

59302,0,So far i am pretty happy with these lights. The housings and lenses are very durable and will not break easily. They produce yellow light and did improve my visability in a heavy snow storm. The only complaint I have is with the switch they included in the kit. It is a cheapo push button. I would suggest purchasing a different switch before you install.
134828,1,"This stuff is a necessary evil if you have a limited slip.Once installed, the benefit was obvious.However, I would design the spout differently. Its easiest to install differential fluids by using a rubber hose and just tilting the bottle on end.The spout on this bottle does not allow for the attachment of a rubber hose. I had to squirt it into the hole and it was a mess.I guess an alternative would be to mix it with the differential oil before putting it in the differential, but my differential was already full of oil.Good product, but why not put a cone spout on the bottle?"

147910,1,Puchased the fine and medium clay bars and used them to remove yellow paint that covered both sides of my vehicle from running over recently painted line markers 4 weeks earlier. I then used the fine(blue) clay bar over the entire vehicle and followed it with a good Carnuba wax to restore the original gloss of my 2006 Honda Pilot. An incredible product and easy to use with minimal elbow grease. Also used it on an older Porsche 911 with original paint and was amazed at how good it looks after finishing it with the carnuba wax.

Be sure to pack your items in plastic bags if they're predicting rain or go for the more expensive waterproof Thule bags.This is much more convenient than the big plastic cargo boxes since it folds up so small, goes in it's own carry bag, and fits on the closet shelf. It also goes on the vehicle quickly with four straps. Very easy to use."

76602,0,"I have mixed feelings about this product. The good- its simple design, easy to install, and convenient. The bad and the ugly- the suction cups dont hold very well in the cold weather, though slightly wetting the suction cups solves this problem. Another issue is that after days, weeks and months of hot, sunny weather, the plastic warps and melts a little, causing the holder to detach from the suction cups and fall off. The plastic isnt very study, so when the holder falls and lands on a hard surface, the plastic will break. Ive been able to use the holder after it fell and cracked many times, though it gets to the point where the platic holder is trashed.Ive had my EZ Pass holder for three years. As of last week, its time to bury it. The plastic so warped and melted and cracked that it wont hold on to the suction cups anymore.I shouldve brought two or three EZ Pass holders three years ago. Having a spare holder would be more than nice, it would be useful. Furthermore, the cost of this product should be lowered by at least $1.00 per holder.Overall, all things considered, I like this product. Wish the materials would be better quality for the current cost. Most of the time this product saved me a lot of time on the toll roads, and in the three years Ive had mine, it certainly did a pretty good job."

146335,2,"I purchased this Torin 2.5-ton floor jack (Mod# T84025) from a big, orange box store. The description here in Amazon, as well as the Northern Tools and Home Depot web sites said this is an ""aluminum/steel"" jack. You would think that the jack being made from ""aluminum"" would result in a much lighter floor jack than those made completely from steel. However, when the jack arrived at my door, I noticed the weight wasn't a whole lot different from my (then) current 3-ton jack.Even Torin's regular steel 2.5-ton floor jack (Mod# T82501) weighs 83 pounds, so a ~20-lb difference between the two didn't impress me much. Curious as to how an ""aluminum/steel"" jack could still weigh in at 60 lbs, I took my trusty magnet out of my toolbox. The only aluminum pieces on the jack is the receiver for the pump handle, the side chassis, the back wheels and the side handles.That said, this is a good-looking, stylish floor jack. It functions well, and the key details like button-head bolts, make this look like a well-designed and built device.Pros:- clean lines; smooth finish- nice details (button head bolts)Cons:- no pad on the handle to protect the lower edge of the car- not as lightweight as one would expect- no saddle pad- under load, one rear wheel lifts about 1/2"" off the groundIf you're looking for a true light-weight floor jack, this may not be what you want. If you want a nice looking, lighter-than-some-others jack, then you'll like this one. I would have rated this at 4 or 5 stars if the description didn't make it seem as though the aluminum portion of this jack would result in a weight found in the lightweight, racing-style jacks. In all fairness though, the descriptions at all three web sites did say this weighed 60 lbs, so it's not as though the weight was misstated."

The 2nd one only lasted 3 months. the manufacturer customer service gave me good advice on how to best rig the unit.

16141,2,"Most of the reviews I read before had more to do with the airbags than the controller. I don't have a comment on the bags yet. This is about the controller.I have a diesel truck and often have heavy loads. I got the airbags to tailor the suspension for the load and the ability to control the ride on the fly seemed like an improvement. I also thought I would supplement the system to provide for emergency air to pump tires on the road. My logic going in was I could add a tank and pressure switch. Then some time later when the compressor burns out then I would replace it with something better.But when you look at what is included in the kit it ends up providing little value. The guage seems OK and does include a separate circuit for illumination which allows it to be dimmed with the dash lights. The momentary switch looks good but I don't think I'll use it my version. The pressure bleed off is actually just a schraeder valve (tire valve) with a clever actuator that holds it in the panel...it will do the job but it isn't expensive. Then there is some wiring harness and tubing and a tiny plastic compressor. The compressor is total junk. They suggest that you install it inside the vehicle and they expressely say that it shouldn't go in the engine compartment or anywhere that it might get heat or moisture. The power requirements of the compressor are probably tiny which is good because the wiring in size and design wouldn't handle a real compressor. There is no relay...it actually switches the power for the compressor directly through the little momentary switch.MSRP is $247.15! I am not convinced that the air compressor could pump up the bags the first time....it is laughable. It is about the size of a large sandwich and everything I can see is plastic. I would never expect this to inflate a tire so any hope I had of providing even emergency ""onboard air"" is ludicrous.I spent $120 [...]. But all I will use is the guage, some tubing, and some of the wiring.Anyone considering this kit ought to just buy the pieces you need and put together your own kit. This one provides no value and costs more than the individual parts would.I'm a believer in buyer beware so I'll eat the cost and consider it a lesson learned. But maybe this can help out the next guy.I originally wrote this review before I completed my in-flight adjustability capability for my truck. Someone commented that it was unfair since I hadn't even installed it. Well I'm now much more experienced with air suspension having built a complete on-board air system capable of powering air tools, filling tires, adjusting the air bags, and could even be used to drive train horns if I wanted to make so much noise. I'm still standing my the original comments. I got the compressor system for less than half of MSRP because of coupons, deals, and Amazon pricing. But even still I think I paid way more than the value of the components. The compressor itself is not available individually so couldn't be priced but everything else in the kit could be purchased as individual parts for much less than the kit. I have only turned on the compressor once just as an experiment and it did work and may even be capable of what the bags require. But it would take forever to pump a tire with it so it is of no other value. In the system I built I did use the guage, momentary switch, bleed valve, and some wiring and fittings but eventually replaced the slip fit fittings with high quality brass screw vesions. I managed to find a second hand Viair compressor but all other parts were new and I spent less on a real system than MSRP of this kit.So I can not say this won't pump your air bags. But with a little design and searching for parts you could build a far more capable system for less money yourself. Depends what you need to accomplish and how much you are willing to think about it."
180555,0,It is not possible to ship a lead acid battery in a ready to use condition. The acid can spill and is very hazardous. Would you feel better if it had a battery but you had to take the battery to a service center to get the acid put in?The only problem is that the information should be better. There should be a bold label stating the lack of a battery and why and also a list of various batteries that can be used. A garden tractor battery would most likely do fine and they are about 20 dollars and widely available .
175321,2,"Stay away from these...they are complete junk.I've gone through two of these kits on my '06 Honda VFR800. The first one failed on a cross country trip when I was in Shamrock, TX. It failed at the bend, and my license plate stayed wedged between my rear tire and my swingarm. Luckily I was in town and heard the rubbing, otherwise it would have resulted in a blown tire, which wouldn't have been fun 2,000 miles away from home. Anyways, I zip-tied my plate to my bike, where it stayed for 6 months until I (foolishly) purchased another Competition Werkes Fender Elimination Kit.Less than 3 weeks after I installed the new kit, it failed in the exact same place (at the factory bend) as the first one. Again, I was in town and heard it happen, so I didn't totally lose my plate.Bottom line...DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE! Do what I did...buy a piece of 3&#34; x 3&#34; x 1/4&#34; aluminum angle stock, cut it to length and drill a few holes. Voila! You have a cheap, simple fender eliminator that will never fail and looks great."

170546,2,"1. The battery booster will not start a car with a dead battery. It only works with a battery that has run down to the point where it will not turn over the engine. You will need a much stronger booster to start a car with a totally dead battery.2. The booster can ruin the computer electronics on some cars. This is stated in the instruction manual. However, when I called the Black and Decker service center, they had no list of which cars would be effected. The service tech said he wished he had a list but he didn't. I guess you're just supposed to try to use this product on your car and find out later.3. I have not returned the product since it will boost phones, etc. and may have some use. However, if I had known that it did not work on dead batteries and could ruin my car, I would never have purchased it."
21426,0,"These chaps are very inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. They look okay as long as you do not get closer than a few feet. With the exception of the bottom ten inches, these chaps are not leather, they are made from ""bonded leather"" which is synthetic with ground up leather particles added to it for the smell. You can easily tell that the ""patchwork"" pattern is fake. I do not know what possessed some of the reviewers to say that the leather is thick, or supple, it is not even close to any of that. The workmanship is as cheap as they come, these will definitely not hold up in a crash. The buckle is indeed the worst offender. If you only buy these for looks and some wind protection like I did, you should be fine, but if you want serious protection from the elements or a road slide, look elsewhere."

32536,2,I bought the 2/6/12 amp product at a local but national parts store chain thinking it was going to be a good one.But it will not charge a battery that is dead and is still good. Sometimes the battery is new but not in use for a few month on one of my collector cars and needs the charge. Also the clamps are crap and break. The spring in the clamp is too strong for the plastic housing and they break in half at the clamping point.No support from where I bought it either. They don't carry the product anymore...

74768,2,"I used the ""Make Sure It Fits"" function to make sure I ordered the Weathertech floor mats. I also went to the company website and used their website tools to make sure I was ordering the right floor mats. (I decided to order directly from Weathertech because they had the complete front and rear mats.) After waiting for 2 weeks and with much anticipation, the order finally came. I paid $15 for shipping in addition to $99 for the floor mats.I tried in vain to make the front floor mats fit and gave up after 15 minutes. I really wanted it to fit well because the product was well-built and looked nice. I called Weathertech Customer Service and they said they would refund my $99 but that I would have to pay shipping charges...$18 bucks down the hole. So, I spent $32 on shipping charges and wasted a bunch of time. For $30 more I could have bought some nice OEM carpets!BTW-I also bought the cargo liner from Weathertech to replace my Husky since it was looking worn. The Husky was better built, much less flimsy and cost a lot less! I will not be buying any more products from Weathertech.All in all, a huge waste of my time and money on the company."

184131,2,"I purchased this at a local hardware store to fix my xbox 360 (it had the torx 8 and torx 10 sizes required) and worked great at first. I got the entire xbox taken apart, but then when it came time to put back together the torx 8 bit started to strip. I was extremely frustrated as I had just reapplied the thermal bonding stuff...and do not have a full set of tools. I was able to cut the tip of the bit off using a pair of pliers and finish the job (which is why I gave the product 2 stars), but I would not trust it to work again.Strongly recommend another torx tool."
171573,0,The piece has a hi quality. No doubt on that.The thing is that it doesn't specify you need two for a complete replacement. They should be saled in pairs.Also it doesn't work for all models they say. (I know for a fact).Thank you.

An emergency ""generator"", actually a back up battery, should be available in an emergency and have high reliability. This one is completely unreliable and will not be any form of adaquate standby power in an emergency. The only function this product has served is to enrich others at my expense.

178209,1,I have used this product on my pickup truck which has exhibited rust on the doors and rear tail gate. It goes on thinly and several coats (3) really fill in the primed spots nicly. I applied this product this past summer and it seems to be holding up very well. THis coming winter will be the true test but I do expect it to hold up well as it has held up quite well to this point (it has been exposed to quite a bit of rain this past fall in New England). It does seem that it is very important to use the primer which is part of the two part process. It's also important to use some sort of wire brush to clean out the heavy rust from the intended area to be painted.Once it dries it is very durable!..
161494,0,"I have been asking them for over a year to simply publish a large ""smart tip"" compatibility chart or table, showing ALL their smart tips and ALL the known compatible devices. They just refer me to their stupid smart tip ""finder"" where you enter in your device/mfg/model# and it tries to find the right tip. What if you have 10 different devices? 100? Too impossibly cumbersome. As others have said, Kensington tech support has no clue. The power adapter does seem to work, IF you are GOD/omniscient and can figure out which tip you need. Knowing the correct tip is essential, since that controls not only the fit of plug into socket, but also voltage. Random guessing, which is what Kensington reduces its customers to, will surely fry your equipment."

162236,1,"I ordered this for my Wrangler. I had lost the factory set and this looked like the best option. If any of you have a Wrangler you know how limited the storage is. I've got two lockboxes in the back of the Jeep that hold tow straps, jumper cables, duct tape, etc. The size of this iron really sold me. It slides open to 21"" if you need the extra leverage and collapses down to about 13"" for storage. I haven't had to use it yet, but Gorilla does make solid products. I'm betting I get plenty of years of service from this. It comes with 2 sockets that adapt to 4 different lugnut sizes (great for if you need to help someone else change a tire). My only gripe is the storage bag that comes with it. It's made of the same material that $5 rain ponchos are made of. I would have preferred a cloth or even neoprene case that would isolate the detachable sockets. It's a minor issue for an otherwise great product for the price.Gorilla Automotive 1721 Telescoping Power Wrench - Standard Socket"

I called the company listed on the package and got little help other than ""return for refund."" Amazon said the same, but now I won't have for my two-month long trip. Product looks very good except for lack of way to hold it to the seat and that is critical under the best of circumstances. Too bad, it could have been nice!"
115936,1,I purchased this stand for use with the Makita LS1013FL. The packaging was excellent and arrived undamaged. The set up was a piece of cake and only took about 1 hour with minimal tools.

82680,1,"I feel that this pump is as good as a new one, for a fraction of the price. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that it was not an EXACT fit. The electrical connector was different, requiring slicing in the supplied replacement connector. The inlet filter was larger and had to be stuffed into the housing. An alternative would be to use the original. The back end of the pump was shaped differently, and the original rubber mount had to be stretched to fit. It seems OK, but I'm not completely happy about that. But I am very happy about saving over $200."

138355,1,"I thought this power supply did better than I expected. Running a Dell D610 under normal use, I got about 50 minutes with. Given that it has 4Mah of storage, that is better than I could have hoped for. I would caution anyone that thinks they should get 9 hours of computer battery life to read the specs and understand what the power requirements of a computer are. There isn't an easily portable product on the market that can do that. A gas generator would but they don't allow those on airplane for some reason??? All kidding aside, one issue that anyone using this with a laptop should realize is that it won't automatically kick the computer into an energy saving mode like it does when you switch to your internal battery so the power draw will be higher and the battery won't last as long even though it is rated pretty close to the same capacity as a normal laptop battery. Anyway, it does well charging my gadgets which is the real reason I bought it anyway. It is worth spending the extra money on this instead of the smaller one because it will give a full charge to the palm, camera battery and the cell phone at the same time."

175225,2,"Reading the reviews, I see I'm not the only to have warranty problems with Tecumseh Engines. I bought this and it worked great. But it is way to loud. We had a power outage and it would not start. It was still under warranty so I thought no problem. WRONG!... I had a carb problem. Repair center said this would be a disputed repair. Because there was a possiblity I might have put gas in it that had some debris in it. Isn't that what the gas filter is for? Anything big enough to clog the carb would have gotten caught in the gas filter and stopped the flow of gas right there. Anyway I called Tecumseh and talked to someone named JEFF in there customer service dept. Jeff was suppose to be the first customer service reps supervisor who I got nowhere with. Jeff said he'd call me back He never did. I called agian a week later and left him a message and he never called back. I called again and left messages with the girl that answers the phone for anyone from their customer service dept. to call me back and explain why this isn't under warranty or why they won't fix it. And I'm still waiting 6 months later. Then I find out that Tecusmseh had consistant carb problems with several of their engines, this being one of them. The carb was defective according to the repair center, but Tecumseh would not pay to fix it."
3260,1,"Just like political parties who cannot come to a unanimous decision, we have some saying this product is a great trickle charger (leaving it connected is no problem), and some saying be sure and disconnect when the battery is fully charged.

The paperwork says it must be disconnected after fully charging the battery (no light or meter included). BUT, another guy says he left his connected for five months with no problems??? Good grief :( Did the description state that it had to be disconnected when the battery became fully charged? If it did, then I'm the schmo. I have to be fair in my rating though.

174238,1,"Hello. I purchased this fob for a 2004 Ford Explorer that came without any fobs and had only 1 coded key at the time of purchase.This fob was literally programmed withing 10 seconds of getting into my car, closing and unlocking all doors, and following the first and 2nd steps in the programming instructions that came within the package. ALL of the buttons worked perfectly and all of the functions worked perfect too (lock, lock w/ horn & lights, open driver only, open all doors, panic alarm on/off, rear glass hatch entry). Also, for what it's worth, the construction seems sturdy enough for the price (can't compare to an original fob as I've never held/touched/operated the original Ford fob). Finally, this fob worked just fine from about 30 feet away, although I haven't tried from any further because I normally don't open my car from further away than that. Cheers!"

52807,0,"I borrowed a timing light from my neighbor and then promptly killed it. New ones are quite a change from the one I killed and those I remember. Nonetheless, this one served well to get my job done and replace the one that had become deceased."
123108,1,I had expected the retaining pin to come with it but it didn't. The product is very nice though. I'm very pleased with it.
48901,2,"Anyone considering purchasing this product should save your money and buy a different brand. Have had this unit for 6 months and it broke while operating. It sounded like a fuse popped but unfortunately there are no replaceable parts.As other reviews mention, ridiculously short electric cord and inflation cord. I'm going back to Campbell Hausfeld brand. You get what you pay for."
169557,1,Reduced noise from panel vibration. Removed resonance when the music hits a certain note.Does nothing to reduce road noise as expected.
52562,0,"Ordered a dashmat for dodge truck, got one for a mustang. Cheep material, go to a real autoparts store for this one."
13503,2,I put this on six months ago and sometimes it justs starts slapping around and making a fluttering noise. I tightened it up but it didn't seem to help. I wouldn't recommend.
89104,1,"I installed these last night. It was getting a little late, but I didn't want to wait for the weekend and after reading the instructions it seemed like a straight-forward task. Everything went smoothly. A rare event for me when it comes to working on a vehicle. Took me about an hour and a half. I started about 7:30 and finished with plenty of daylight left to clean up.Several reviews mentioned the need for a breaker bar, so I used one, though I didn't need it on my '06 Sierra. The bolts were pretty tight, but I think I could have gotten by with a ratchet.my only complaint is that the bars are not marked driver/passenger, so I had to figure out which bar lined up correctly with the center bracket. All the brackets are marked, but not the bars. The bars could have been stamped in an inconspicuous place. But this is a VERY minor nit.They look great, and they'll look even better after I wash the truck! :) I rarely rate anything 5 stars. I reserve that for products that exceed expectations. These bars meet my expectations. I feel I got value for my money."
72264,1,PROS:This is my third K&N; Air Filter. I bought this one for my 83 VF1100C Magna. I also have one on my 96 VF750CD Magna. If you buy one of these and have carbs rather than FI you will more than likely need to re-jet since this allows a lot more air through than a stock air cleaner. Most Every thing that K& N makes is top notch.CONS:The only disapointment on this was it was not pre-oiled like all the other K&N; Filters I have bought. You need to spend the time & ?mess? to oil this prior to installation & use.
33603,0,"This hitch carrier will work fine for basic cargo carrying; note the actual product does not include the high side-rails (which are optional). Build quality is okay, but assembly is a chore, and the hitch tube is not as rugged as I would have liked (it has thinner walls than I would have expected). Also the hitch tube is very square (the edges are not well rounded) and will not fit the receiver on one of my vehicles because of the square edges. Test the receiver tube as soon as you get it to make sure it will work for your vehicle before you go to the trouble of assembly. No hitch pin is included."
25729,2,"This helmet is very poorly constructed, even for a ""novelty"" helmet. It is much smaller than a real XXL and _reeks_ of chemicals. The plastic trim aroung the lip of the helmet doesn't meet in the back and leaves an ugly gap of almost an inch. The biggest problem is that the straps are not riveted at the same point on both sides, making for a very sloppy look and uncomfortable feel. Don't waste your money on this one, you'll be disappointed."
103852,2,"Very upset over this order as I think the product description is uninformative. It says fabtech leaf springs (plural) so I was under the idea I was getting a pair of springs, and it came today and only one, what the heck am I going to do with one spring???!! Not cool AMAZON!!!!!Fabtech FTS44005 3.5"" Performance System Front Leaf Springs"
167466,1,I'm very pleased with this cover. The previous reviews were helpful too. I decided to go with the medium size so the complete bike would be protected and I'm glad I did. It covers completely. Last time I bought a cover that wasn't waterproof I was sorry I wasted my money. The bike was wet whenever it rained. The little extra is well worth every cent. I can't say enough about it. Very happy.
103934,0,"I had a new range put in our RV, and I thought that this cover would work. The only problem is if you have a range that is recessed in to the counter top, this cover will not work. You can not open the cover completely, so I had to return it."
20413,1,"Perfect fit. This was the exact replacement part at a much better price then buying at the dealer or local autoparts store. Shipping was fast, would recommend."
187421,1,"This fits all convertible Suzuki Samurais. The application function says that it does not fit an '88 Samurai, but it does.I use it to increase A/C effectiveness with a factory style top installed. It roughly doubles the effectiveness of the A/C as the A/C is now only cooling the forward portion of the Samurai.It does the same for the heater in the winter.It also reduces noise quite a bit.It helps quite a bit even when the top is off on cold mornings, allowing the heater to help keep you warm. If a bikini top is installed, the heater is quite effective. A/C is ineffective though, even with a bikini top on."
165579,1,I purchased these for my husbands 20 year old BMW 325. They fit great and were very easy to install. Husband loves them.
107589,1,"The truck cover has been great; easy to install and easily opened, though my wife has a little trouble with the springs when re-attaching."
180564,0,Works great for dealing with the side view mirror blind spot. Now I can see at a glance what before took me a 1/4 head turn to see if there was a car on my side. I dont like the blue. Im going to buy another that is standard clear mirror. Havent had it on long enough to see if it comes off as other reviewer experienced.
122582,0,"I gave your produce a less than stellar rating, as the winch did not include an mounting plate, the zip-ties which were provided broke, and the handle-bar mounting bracket was not able to be tightened sufficently to keep it from turning."
128885,1,These lights are GREAT!! They really changed the look of the truck. I would recommend them to anyone looking to upgrade they're lights. I would give it a 10 out of 10.
56219,1,"I wrench a lot and also use this for to ride my bicycle. It's very comfortable, doesn't bulk up like other so-called $40 MTB gloves that give you horrible blisters and dirt cheap! Grip is excellent even for rubber or foam grips.Few years ago I bought this and they lasted for quite some time. Since then they changed the design as I noticed the wear is MUCH faster so I have to buy a new pair every six months or so. But can't complain, for under $12 it's so worth the price!"
3295,2,"The title says it. Flimsy and cheesy looking. Yea, ya get what ya pay for most of the time. I ended up getting a stailess canister rather than put this in my classic."
172315,1,"Arrived fast, no trouble with shipping. Goes on quite easily and is solid. Great addition to the truck."
99441,1,"Would have given this product a 5 star if the the instructions would have included to remove both old ones prior to installing the new struts, this enables you to open the hatch another 1/4 inchallowing the new struts to be installed."
155802,2,The pad worked great at first. I used the pad with the Meguiar's DA and Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. This is on a 2011 truck so the paint was not in bad shape. I used this to remove some water spots. It did work well for the water spots but this pad didn't even get through half of the truck's surface. The velcro backing came off the pad and was rendered useless.
108795,1,"I bought several of these cans to store an emergency water supply in my home. They work well enough for my purpose and I am happy with them for their cost.THE GOOD:The can is simply good value for what is costs. You can get a better military style can but it will cost you a lot more.The dual handle design makes pouring easy.The can hits the perfect balance of capacity and weight. Any heavier and I would have trouble handling it, any smaller and they would be much less useful.THE BAD:The instructions say not to store the spout inside the container but without the spout the yellow sealing cap is not water tight. This means you must store the can with the spout hanging out making it likely to be damaged.The can does not allow you to view the water level easily but I was able to view the water level by holding a flashlight on opposite side as I filled it."
153574,2,This mirror does not fit exactly right on my 2000 camry. There is a quarter-inch gap between the top edge of the assembly and the door. I wish I had tried to see if it fit before painting it....
184369,2,"I can't believe I bought this. I usually check reviews before buying so not sure if I was just asleep or what. Needless to say, it's leaking like crazy and I need to find something that actually works.DO NOT BUY!!!!"
28584,2,"comes with built in watt meter and dc voltmeter that have no accuracy (worthless) just to make sale. i called power bright about problem and tech reprehensive said they were all made like that. if i knew about this i would not have bought, lost all faith in unit. what is the sense of putting a four digit(digital) meter on the unit with no accuracy. great engineering. i have a 35 watt load on and it shows 0000 watts, i have a 100 watt load and it shows 40 watts. the last digit alway shows a 0 in volt or watt mode. LOL"
165622,1,"This battery charger is excellent. MOst impressive is the quick charges it gives, I also like the percentage readout you get regarding how much the battery is charged. Its handy and does the job for reasonable money."
156208,0,"I bought this to add bit of style and function for my 01 Suburban. Although the chrome finish was good, I was not able to fit the door flush to the body of the vehicle. The contour of the Suburban's panel has a slight curve, yet this piece is flat. The instructions indicated that if the piece was not flush at test fit, you could adjust it with 'the Phillips screws'. The only Phillips screws on the door were the ones that connected the latch bracket to the vehicle in place of the rubber bump stops for the stock fuel door. Even with the screws tightened all the way, the bracket stuck out just enough to leave a 1/8"" gap between the fuel door ring and the vehicle at the top and bottom position when fully assembled. I gave three stars since this is supposed to fit a lot of GM model trucks and SUV's, so it may work just fine for someone else's vehicle or expectation."
122885,2,"I just finished installing this product on my 2012 Charger RT Max. Fitment sucked! The brackets dont fit very well, and the whole setup feels very cheap. The box the air filter sits in is placed at a different angle than the air tube enters, so you have to cock the filter on the tube so it doesnt rub up against the core support. The airbox WAS NOT specifically designed for the charger underhood compartment, as it leaves huge open gaps under the box. I was surprised when I first researched this product and it is the same part number as the challenger and the 300 series. Well it might fit one of the other models well, but it fits very poorly on the charger. oh and the box sits extremely close to an AC line, so if it shows the slightest rub, It is coming off!!! Since it is already installed, I will leave it awhile and see if it actually increases HP and MPG as advertised. I now see why it is priced at half the cost of the Mopar cold air kit. If I had it to do over again, I would stick with the stock box until I could afford the Mopar kit. Oh well, I hope this review helps with your decision and I save others from this horrible kit."
133247,1,"The end user (mechanic) has not installed this yet, but it seems to be very well built at a pretty competitive price. We are very happy with this device. We are going to use it in an unconventional manner, but I believe it will work well and last a very long time. We are trying this out along side a competitors fairlead, but I think both of these name brand devices will work."
28162,0,"I bought this for the bathroom next to where I keep the litter boxes. It works decently at cutting down dust (of course I use Swheat Scoop which isn't as dusty as clay cat litters). It also eliminates odors... eventually. It's a small area but I have to leave the door open so my cats can access their litter boxes whenever they need to so it does take a few hours to dispel the stench. It's more effective just to clean the box right after they defecate. But, if I'm gone all day, it helps the house smell better for my return.When you receive the air purifier it comes with a filter that's supposed to last four months. There's a red thing you snap on the back that works as a timer. You can see it in the picture. When that line is red, it's time to change the filter. Maybe having it so direct to the cat box I overworked the filter, but the purifier stopped eliminating odors after about two months. There are filters specifically designed for pets that I purchased and planned to try out but ended up moving to a new apartment where the appliance doesn't really work out for me. That's the other downside. It's really large and realistically takes up one outlet since most bathroom appliances have oversized plugs. It also takes up a lot of room, which isn't a problem if you have multiple plugs but in my new small bathroom I only have one directly above the sink.It is rather loud. It didn't bother my cats when it was directly above their litter boxes but sometimes I'd hear it when I was across the hall in my bedroom and wonder, what is that noise?? before remembering it was the air purifier. It's probably no louder than your fridge unless you have a really super quiet fridge, but it's constant and gets annoying after awhile.Lastly, it's an eyesore. It's so big and heavy gravity pulls it a little out of the outlet and is just generally ugly."
37777,1,"It doesn't feel quite like the previous one I had (same version, just smaller) but so far has been doing the job. It's much better quality than most other ones out there. Definitely worth the price to take care of the larger investment."
58619,1,"THIS COVER IS GREAT. IT KEEPS YOUR HANDS FROM SLIPPING ON THE STEERING WHEEL, EASY TO PUT ON,EASY TO CLEAN AND LOOKS GREAT. I HAVE THE MATS, TOO. THEY PUT SLICK STUFF ON THE STEERING WHEEL AT THE CAR WASH AND YOUR HANDS SLIP ON THE STEERING WHEEL, WELL, THIS WILL END THAT PROBLEM. PRICE WAS RIGHT AND IT ARRIVED RIGHT ON TIME AND IN GREAT CONDITION. I LOVE IT."
107790,1,"Stick with Denso for Japanese models. Now my 2002 Toyota 4runner vsc trac and check engine light is out. Its as easy as going to Denso website entering make, model, year,engine of vehicle then search on amazon and find it. Way cheaper than dealer or parts store. Press tab on plug remove the 2 nuts, old sensor off along with the old gasket. Install new gasket, new sensor, tighten down 2 nuts reconnect plug. pocket the savings."
109128,0,I have not installed these brake pads on my car as of yet. But. They were delivered in excellent conditon. I will recommend these brake pads. Bendix quality is exceptional.
111737,1,I have it installed for over 5 months now and its working perfectly as intended. The adhesive side is very good at attaching to the ground and I have not noticed any movement or it coming off even after repeatedly hitting it to know I have reached the desired spot.The moment I hit it I know its time to stop. This is good for places where you know the tire will hit this for sure. If you have more room then the width of this device then be careful about missing it.
121482,1,"Puchased for Automotive and Motorcycle cleaning. A great product at a real good price. Perfect when you just want to wipe off a few smudges, or light dust, or use for drying towel."
120918,1,"I have had this hemet about 1 year now. I bought it while living in Germany. I just laid my motorcycle down and this helmet worked perfect. It absorbed the impact and my head has never been better, wish my ribs were the same. I am going to buy another Multitec once I get my bike back up and running. My head is worth the cost!!"
51781,0,"I had high hopes for this lettering set, but it was unfortunately not to be. I'm sure that others will find numerous uses for these but be advised that the product description does not state that they will only adhere to smooth, non-porous surfaces."
10289,1,I bought these for scrapbooking. Works well on the pages. I'm sure everyone else is looking to use these on their truck. I do feel these would not be a problem on paint or window of a truck. They're a sturdy decal and appear to be uv protected.
50252,2,"it would be nice if you would put the dimensions of the product on the page. how long? how wide? How can buyers contact you? where is the contact seller option? when we select our truck to see if it matches, theres no option to put the length of our truck bed. no return information. very poor customer service."
149069,1,"Installed on a 2006 Mazda Tribute. Easy to install on the front wheels. Just turn the wheels and install the three self tapping screws on each side with a screw gun. Took all of 15 minutes. I'll get 2 more for installing on the rear, though that will require lifting the car and taking off the tires. Didn't rate it 5 stars because these molded plastic parts are probably worth about $6.00, including screws."
83389,1,"High quality and durable. Mounting the deflector was a challenge. I had to mount the metal retainers by screwing the nuts on slightly and then pushing the deflector down hard to catch the J-hook mounting hardware in the opening. The middle mount was easy; but, the side mounts were difficult. I was afraid I'd break the deflector because I had to push it down so hard. However, I shouldn't have worried because about a six months after I mounted the product, I was involved in a car accident . . . high speed head-on collision with a driver going the wrong way. I managed to swerve to the left just as we impacted which resulted in my Jeep Commander being launched into the air for an aerial flip followed by another rollover on the ground. The three metal mounting brackets were crushed; but, two held on anyway and the plastic deflector didn't even crack. It can be used again with replacement mounting hardware."
84356,0,"This product is great for the price but after i had put mine on the brake it didn't fit over my accelerator. I drive a 96 silverado which is an insanely popular model so i think ""universal"" is a pretty inaccurate description and from the looks of the other reviews it doesn't fit either. they also squeak against shoes when they're wet and the screws might come loose but they are a pretty cheap product"
113051,2,"Pads did not fit, watch out when selecting you vehicle on Amazon for parts finder. I was WAY off for my Camry."
55124,1,I purchased these rotors for my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I plan to keep my Jeep for several more years and I wanted an upgrade from OEM rotors. I'm very pleased with their performance and they are a nice price effective upgrade.
47427,0,"The banana plugs are sheathed, so as shipped the leads will not fit older multimeters. However, it a soft plastic sheathing that can be easily removed with a utility knife, just be careful of your fingers."
92771,1,"I am glad that we found this mirror, we tried the junkyard and they wanted 80 dollars. Thank you for listing something so cheap!!!"
102411,0,"not not a very good product,i would think the stick on would be better.even though they fit,but will slide down and to let up my window i would to push the visor out a little bit.other than that they look great"
35542,1,"The part works fine, but did not include a gasket. It would be nice to know that before ordering, which is the only reason for 4/5 stars."
15605,2,"I ordered struts and rear shocks for my 1997 Mercury Villager (both Monroe) but the rear shocks were no where near the same quality as the OEM shocks. The construction seemed to be cheaper and the weight of the new shocks lead me to believe they were cheaply built too. I was amazed to find the OEM (motorcraft) shocks were not leaking, I don't expect the replacements to last 14 years and 135,000 miles. JMO UPDATE: 10-21-2011 the Monroe 32207 on the left rear started leaking oil with only 4,000 miles and 8 months of use. I tried to get Monroe to warranty the poorly made product but had no luck. Amazon came to my rescue and gave me a complete refund....I will be replacing the defective with KYB or OEM."
100979,2,"THE BEST ON THE MARKET FOR THE PRICE...WITH ALOT OF REALLY""COOL FEATURES""...YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU BOUGHT THIS ONE FOR YEARSTO COME..! THIS UNIT IS REALLY 200 WATT'S..! (NOT 15WX4)"
49448,1,"My husband and I bought this carrier on Amazon and read all the reviews. This carrier was PERFECT for our trip from Biloxi, MS to Milwaukee WI. This carrier was not noisy and did not shift during our ride. This carrier was VERY ROOMY! We fit 1 double stroller, infant exersaucer, medium tub full of toys, small duffle bag full of shoes, 4 beach towles and 1 twin size blanket in a bag, bag full of halloween decor, small tackle box full of play cars, large bag of diapers, 2 shoe boxes, infant bath seat. There was still room for odds and ends that could fit in the open cracks. We read on most of the reviews to tape the extra straps to prevent wind noise and we did that. This was the best 50 dollars spent on our trip! We HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CARRIER!"
3667,2,"Be Careful! I ordered these thinking they would be great, but they did not fit! I tried both in my mini van and my mini cooper. And the material and stitching are thin and weak, a slight stretch of the material caused an immediate ripping sound. Yikes! Anyways, I sent them back and only got refunded for 1 because of the tear! Total jip!"
93239,2,"The ONLY things I put in the bag were 2 camp cots - very lightweight. The bag, as others note, is stiff, but what's worse is that the zippers are made of VERY pliable metal. They bent like a spoon in Uri Geller's hands. I noticed after the first leg of the trip (about 500 miles) that small holes had worn through where the roof rack met the bag. The noise from the bag (not the straps, which I tightened and taped) hitting the roof was like listening to a speedbag, for hours. By the time we returned, there was a 4-inch failure of the front seam, and another 2-inch gap in the rear.I can't recommend this product to anyone. I've put photos of the zippers and seams so you can see for yourself"
96938,1,"I really liked these lights while they lasted. These are not obnoxiously blue or bright, they're not yellow but an excellent white.They only lasted 2 years & 3 months which from previous reviews, appears to be normal but I expect longer life, hence the 4 stars."
81095,2,"Pros:-They're cheap-The lookCons:-Made of cheap plastic (about as hard as a Frisbee)-Don't lock in securelyI purchased the correct size but the hubcaps don't lock in tight. I've already lost 2 under normal driving conditions. If they weren't so cheap, I would have went back to get them when they came off. Get these if you're selling your car and don't care if they come off."
3044,1,"Install was fairly easy on the 02 Camry, although I had to bend the cover and the attached tubing in order to install the filter. If there was an easier way for me to remove the cover, then the install would have been cake.A word of advice to anyone purchasing or thinking about purchasing for the first time: make sure you take a look at your filter housing under the hood and make sure you have a very good idea of what you are doing before you do the install. A service manual might also be very wise because it will likely tell you exactly how to remove the cover.Installation is extremely easy once you know how to remove the filter housing cover correctly without damaging it. I got lucky because I was able to lift the cover up just enough to install the filter...no damage and no check engine light. Performs as expected."
131499,1,"I have had this installed for over a year with no issues. Works very well. We actually use both lasers to park one car (a minivan) by lining them up at two distances. This helps line the van up early, then gives a dot at which to stop."
163485,1,I purchased this meter because my round meter got broken by me. This lil bugger installed very easily and works just as good. highly recommend.
90529,0,"Yeah, it broke. The door had been stripped and everything was greased. I gave the handle 3 stars because there is always the possibility that i just pulled too hard..."
104060,0,"it's OK, on one front shade, the tip was broken, but it still worked,because of the 3m tape, not worth the trouble, or money on returns."
50492,1,I bought this for my 2002 expedition. Great fit and easy to install. Looks great in the vehicle. I would recommend this product.
2887,1,"I love this product, I Have a Ford F150, did the running boards,bed rail caps, trim around back window,tail gate handle, I even did my tires and then cleaned off the white letters with lacquer thinner, here and there I got a little on the paint and it wiped right off no problem, The other guys car must be dry with no wax if he had trouble getting it off paint. It does penetrate not just sit on top. Seven months since applied and still looks new!"
94735,0,"Some of the components were low quality (clamps and valve). After installing, within 100 miles, the truck gas gauge went to ""E"" with a warning (auxiliary tank full). Removed the cap to inspect and fuel overflowed. Immediately shut off the auxiliary tank and issues returned to normal - I think. I am reserving judgement."
67752,0,"Product does not remove fine scratches. I followed the direction and went over the headlights 3 times and it still did not remove the scratches like the product said it would. The product made the headlights look cleaner and protected, but still did not remove the scratches and flaking of the outer coating."
114709,0,Its an okay charger. The last Solar Charger that I had was much more substantial (was heavier). This one is very good for a homeowner who uses it once in a while. JMK
111896,1,...it does the job and comes with double-stick squares as well as screws to secure it. Does the trick and fits nicely on the inside of a closet or cabinet door in your RV.
92591,0,it was damage can i have them replace their ware not in the correct packing box and u take them out the box and place them in a tube
173167,2,"Shocks came in 3 days - excellent. They were rear shocks for my 87 Jetta. Price was excellent and I'm sure I got what I paid for, that said, they pale in a performance comparison to my 93 Golf's Bilstein HD's. I was hoping for better. They make a decent OEM replacement, however."
56105,2,"i bought a set from the local auto store and they lasted me less than a month at work, i am at 3 days shy of a month on these gloves and my thumb index and middle fingers on both hands are torn through, and my left ring finger is almost there as well, i bought these in hopes they would be a step up from the cheap 4 dollar ones that only lasted a month and these were actually worse! i am a tire installer and i put in 40 hours of nothing but gloves and these just do not hold up! i will say if your doing light work they may be great as they are comfortable and easy on and off, as well as you can work with the smallest of items and not lose your ability to handle!"
10344,0,I received the products in a timely manner it was new and all the parts with their and fit perfectly. However I'm disappointed with shipping and handling at $19 for each one I ordered 2 items they both came in one box why was there 2 charges for shipping and handling.Disappointed in Rhode Island
83163,1,I had received the order in the expected time of arrival and the Thetford 13168 Aqua Magic IV Water Valve product worked fine.Completely satisfied customer!
58704,2,"The purchase was intended to turn a Chevy 3800 series II engine which is a 90^ V6 for those unaware, which turns out that the crank shaft snout is a few tenths of an inch too wide. Other than that the socket looks like it would work for older models or smaller crank shaft snouts, this would have been well worth the purchase had the Item actually worked."
108112,0,These lights look good but you get what you pay for these are low budget lights you can tell as soon as you bolt on. I painted the brackets black and bought stainless bolts to replace the bolts supplied. The light is good about what I expected (I replaced my stock JK fog lights with a pair of pilot 4&#34;) that is why I gave these a try. The harness was way to short for my application on 2010 jeep. For the cost they probably deserve 4 stars losing only for the short harness. If you want decent looking lights on a low budget these are worth a look.
75613,1,"Not too noticeable on a street bike, but now I have more air and clean air going in. Move tank for install."
27137,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
63239,1,"Inverter works, but documentation doesn't mention that the power led has 2 states, red and green. Plug into Civic lighter plug and turn on ignition and you get a red led, but NO A/C POWER OUT. You need to get the green LED for it to work, which apparently on my Civic requires that you turn on the ignition first, then plug in the Cobra."
105934,0,Good filter but it does not come pre-oiled like they do on other sites! Had to order the oil separately which was another $18 if i recall
14828,1,I love this product and I keep it in stock. If you have glass tables or countertops and stainless steel products this cleaner should be on your to buy list.

142684,2,This is suppose to last 1 year or more will it lasted about 2month I did everything like the directions sad would like to get my money back its a joke
53531,2,"But with that said, I expected this seemingly simple gadget to perform as intended, at least for a while. I used it to charge/tend a 1 yr old 12v battery and it seemed okay: the red light lit up per the instructions, the wall wart adapter became warm, and I could hear the fluid in the battery bubbling (boiling?). The problem is that it never stopped going full bore and never went into trickle charge mode, and the green light never came on.After reading other reviews about the Tender Jr. prematurely cooking batteries I didn't want to take my chances and purchased a competitor's product. It gave me a good laugh though, b/c whomever stuck the ""Q.C.Pass"" sticker on the unit was either incompetent or simply didn't give a rip if it functioned or not. Thus, I can't recommend this product."
19040,1,"I just used this product recently on a friends car. He lent me his ""extra"" car while my car was in the shop. It was a 2001 Mustang that usually sits about 85% of the time. I decided to wash the car and found the NXT generation Sprax Wax with my car cleaning supplies. (I purchased it approx 1.5 years ago and forgot about it)and misted while the car was almost dry. It left an incredible shine on an other wise dull paint. It made a marketable difference in literally 15 minutes. I can only imagine what the finish would look after a proper clay, polish and wax with NXT as a booster."
36711,0,I had to grind off one of the three tabs to get light to fit in socket. Has this changed over the years.
2330,0,"good product for the cost.. had a little trouble understanding the instruction. had to do a little modify to make it fit my 2010 truck. but all in all I am satisfied with the product,"
12800,1,I was under pressure because we drew for secret santas this year in my family with a $50 limit. On my victoms list was a pair of leather chaps for his bike. I didn't think it was possible until I found this amazing buy. The quality is great and I can't wait to see his reaction when he opens his gift. Great buy and I would recomend to anyone looking for this product. It shipped quickly and I have no complaints.
67177,1,"I ordered this for my 2003 Montana after the brake pedal got a bit soft. Came packaged well, looks brand new and fit perfectly. It's been a few months now and it's worked flawlessly."
105748,1,Needed to replace longer version of the Firestone Air bags when I lowered the rear of my truck 2 inches. Worked like a charm!
40536,0,"This pillow, bought to boost me a couple of inches since I'm so short, works quite well. It is comfortable and does provide a couple of extra inches; however, there is one flaw. It is a bit slick on the bottom so it slides around on the leather seat which is just a bit annoying."
154396,2,"I needed a kick stand to work on my son's 12 inch bike, the description said it would work on a 12 inch, and it does not."
153401,2,"The inverter supplies power, but at a cost. The cooling fan seems to be a huge draw on the DC power source(battery) if left connected for an extended period. In addition the power provided has such a bad shape(the modified sine wave) that most devices make a humming or crackling type of noise. I was unable to use this inverter to power the following due to the noise : an outlet strip, a computer monitor(flat lcd), a tv(flat lcd), a stereo, a dvd player, a vcr, or computer speakers.Most battery chargers warn against ever plugging into an inverter, so I didn't even try anything like that.I have been able to plug in lights(normal bulbs and low watt)."
39450,1,Came in quickly and can tell a difference from the paper stock air filter. Just make sure you read the instructions when putting it on your bike.
99234,1,"This product does exactly what I need it to do; it protects my new car door from getting scratched along the edge. It goes on super easy, and stays in place, which is what I was concerned about.. great all around!"
168076,1,"Installation was a bear. But this was due to my vehicle's wheel configuration, and the not the product. Now that the equalizers are on, maintaining good, equal pressure is a breeze - instant visual identification of the current pressure status, and simple, one-stop inflation for both tires."
44204,1,"As others have said, the lead holders are useless and the leads are cheap, but leads can be replaced. The meter is easy to use, relatively fast and the numbers are easy to read for my 54 year old eyes, even without my reading glasses. The 10-amp port makes it usable on my motorcycle and cars (not for starter or charging circuits). Definitely worth the money."

178503,1,"I was so tired of my back window on my Jeep falling. After I got these, I quickly remembered how the window was supposed to just pop up! Installation was super easy and they work like a charm. They're pretty stiff at first, but they break in after a little bit, but not too broken in where the glass is falling. Much cheaper than buying these at any auto parts stores."
131860,2,"I ride a 2006 V-rod VRSCA. I'm 5'-11"" tall with a normal torso to leg length ratio and this shield is too short. The wind hits me right in the forehead. By my estimate, it needs to be 3"" taller. When trying to decide the size of your shield you must take into account the rake angle that the shield will be mounted at. Memphis Shades stated the size of the shield as 19"" above the headlight, but that isn't actually true. The rake angle of the shield substantially reduces the height above the headlight. Unless, you are like 5'-8"" tall, get a bigger shield."
145665,2,"I live on a paved country road, with heavy forest on one side and corn fields on the other. My main concern is wildlife on the road, particularly deer. With my old bulbs, I could just catch the ""ghost"" of a deer on the road, and barely have time to stop, driving only 40-45 mph. I've been spoiled by running 100-watt bulbs in my motorcycle, which will clearly light up a deer or a raccoon 300 yards away. Plenty of time to stop.After a lot of consideration, I finally decided to try these SilverStar bulbs. They claim whiter light, and that you can see 30% wider to the sides, and 30% farther down the road. On the first two points, this is true. The light is noticeably whiter, and the light pattern is definitely wider. But seeing farther down the road? No. That deer I could barely see in time this morning was proof of that.How can they claim that you can see 30% farther down the road? Well, original equipment bulbs are often only 45 watts. These are claimed to be 65 watts on the package. (The bulbs themselves are marked 60 watts!) Also, they compare to OEM bulbs running at 80% power. What kind of apples-to-oranges comparisons are those? Marketing hype comparisons.Since the light is whiter, they give the ""illusion"" that you can see better. And you can, up close. But at a distance, no better.Muscle-car guys have a saying-- ""There's no replacement for displacement."" Well, the same is true for light. It doesn't rhyme so nice, but, ""There's no replacement for wattage.""Are these ""better"" than original bulbs? Well, yes and no. For close-up visibility and width of field, yes. For seeing down the road, no. Are they ""40-bucks better?"" No way. Especially considering you can buy American-made 100-watt bulbs for only about 8 bucks each, and they last just as long. (Yes, I know they're not DOT-legal. But compare the very unlikely cost of a ticket, compared to repairs after hitting a deer. And yes, I dim them well in advance of oncoming traffic.)I'm sending these back to where I bought them.***********************Update-- Some have complained about Sylvania's guarantee. I contacted Sylvania by e-mail from their web-site feedback form [...]. I got an answer the same day, saying that if the retailer would not return my money, they would. They gave me a return address, and said to include a copy of their e-mail and a copy of my receipt, and they would refund my money within 3-4 weeks. I think this speaks well of Sylvania's guarantee and their customer service.The retailer refunded my money, so I did not need to test this."
171669,0,"Before buying this, I was using tarps to cover my vehicle and keep it clean as I was restoring it. I assumed a true car cover would come with loop holes to fasten with bungees or something beneath the car to keep it in place. All this was, besides being too big for the car (actually I didn't mind this, I think I was sent the wrong size anyway) it was only a giant scratchy sheet with an elastic around the bottom; something that would not stand up well to New England weather/wind/storms. So with a little improvising, and after losing it once in the wind, I ended up cutting some holes in the sides of it and fastening the cover in the same way I had the tarps. It'll do the job, but I personally don't think it was worth the money."
125445,1,excellent !!!is an excellent product arrived in excellent condition and is beautiful and high quality.the color is perfectthank you !!!!!
98036,1,"This tool fits perfectly on the oil canister on our 2009 Toyota Sienna and on the oil filter on our 2007 (4 cylinder engine) Toyota Camry. You'll save over $40.00 buying it on Amazon compared to buying it elsewhere. I agree with ""Chops"" though, as the part is shorter in length than what the picture shows."
6711,2,I put them on my truck with no problem. The directions were good and I am sure I put them on right. I then moved the truck back and forth a few times so that I could align the truck with my snow plow and attach it. The next morning I went out to use the truck and found that on two of the wheels the cables had come apart! Again I am sure the chains were put on correctly. The rubber cable tightener did not hold them tight enough so the chains FELL OFF! DO NOT BUY THESE!
170056,0,"Mobil 1 Isn't a bad oil. In fact it's a pretty good oil. I have used Mobil 1 for years in my autos. Is Mobil 1 the best oil you can put in your engine? I don't think so. First off Mobil 1 is a group III synthetic, which means it is not 100% PAO Synthetic. I now use an oil that's Group IV (100% Pure) Synthetic that out performs Mobil 1 and all other synthetics."
175991,0,"I bought this to replace a rusted out bracket on a 96 subaru wagon. While the diameter for the sway bar was correct, there are no measurements to confirm the width the the bracket. It was about an inch short lenghtwise so i drilled an new bolt hole in the bracket on the car side and made this work. Seems to be holding up but could use some more technical specs or specific application information."
90390,1,I have noticed an immediate improvement in my MPG with this product. I installed the filter in my 2005 Volvo XC 90 V8 and our average MPG is now around 18 or more. Previously it was only about 17 MPG. I have recommended this to everyone who will listen to me about it.
13596,1,This grill looks great and the price is great. It was a birthday present for my son and he loved it. It really changed the look of his truck!
71586,0,"We bought this for my son two years ago on sale at Big Lots for $100. He was five at the time and skinny! He is still skinny and weighs about 50 pounds. Even though he is so small his bed has a huge depression in the middle where he lays, and it appeared pretty early on in the life of the mattress. I doubt he'll get much more use out of it before we have to replace it."
63077,1,"The bushings on my sway bar kept squeaking. I lubed them once with some other gunk, but it didn't last. This stuff comes in a big tub, so you can slather it all over your bushings. It's super sticky (wear gloves when applying!) and seems pretty waterproof. I expect it to last a long time. Squeak cured!"
22402,0,"This part will bolt in properly and provide air for a 2000 Dodge RAM 1500 Pickup heater box. However, the fan motor cooling port is not in the right spot. Also, the blower motor housing cover does not have the same bolt pattern as this motor. So, essentially you can use it to repair your heater box, but you won't be able to get everything back together as with OEM. You'll have to leave the dash's plastic blower motor cover off, and leave the fan motor cooling hose dangling out of the heater box."
95195,1,I just put these in my 2004 GMC Sierra 5.3 and it seems to have more bottom end pull than wien I had NGK's but those did have ~ 80K on them. Fuel mileage doesn't seem to have changed but I just put the Bosch in.....we'll see how that is affected. Overall happy with the purchase.
69227,1,I haven't checked it with a volt meter but the trickle charge voltage seems high. Other than that it seems to work as advertized.
98492,2,"Given the price this was an okay purchase. If I did it again I would spend a little more and get the g2 kit.ProsGreat red color.Easy to use. No mixing involved.ConsAs others have said, the included brush is terrible. I didn't finish a single caliper before it fell apart.After 1 month there is already at least one chip in the paint. I spent my time by taking the calipers off completely and cleaning them heavily so the paint would stick and there would be no dirt or grime. There is no reason they should be chipping already.I'm already planning to redo these this spring with a different brand of paint."
35796,0,"I received my steering wheel cover very quickly, which was nice. However, I'm not overly impressed with it. I struggled to get it to fit on my steering wheel (2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport) and there are spots on the cover with sharp/pokey plastic pieces. It's cute, I just don't think the quality is the greatest."
30405,1,This sunshade is custom fit for the Toyota Cruiser so it covers the entire windshield providing excellent shade and blocking out the heat. I love it!
178703,0,"Pros:- Great price (bought pair as BOGO for half the usual cost).Neither Pro or Con:- Average performance for brand new blades.Cons:- Missing parts.- Good customer experience but no follow-through.Received the 18"" pair quickly but both blades were missing the adapter my car uses. The instructions clearly describe this adapter as an available part of the package so I called Silblade to explain the oversight. The person who took my call was very kind and helpful. I gave her my address and was promised the adapters would be in my hands shortly. Three weeks later, still no adapters and I grew tired of waiting. I scrounged the adapters from the old wiper blades and installed the Silblades. As expected, the fit was a match and the blades feel solid on the wiper arm.After driving in a day of rain with the brand new blades, they're average compared to any blades I've tried. There's no noise, slap or judder from the blades even on dry(ish) glass. Of course, the weather has warmed up here now and I would expect a new blade to be quiet when it's more pliable. As for water clearing ability, the blades do leave tiny streaks (like an old blade with cracks or a nick in the rubber). Other than the streaks, they're sufficient at all speeds. What else can I say? It's a wiper blade and tough to get excited about.Time will tell if the film the blade deposits on the windshield will hurt or help. With any luck, the streaks will diminish as a result of this film or some other break-in mechanism.Hope this helps and good luck with your purchase!"
175995,1,"Does exactly what it's supposed to even if it's a little pricey for what it is. I put mine on the torn up dash of my 1988 toyota pickup and let it stay there for a few days to take shape without velcro'ing it down. after a few days I went ahead and pulled it tight with the included velcro pieces and it's 1000 times better than the dash without the mat. The fit is perfect and even though it seems a bit much for a shaped piece of carpet, it's the best deal I could find and there don't seem to be any compromises in quality. Good luck."
54726,1,This is my first review to ever write on this site only for the purpose to write how amazing this product is. I used this on my 2004 Seadoo Rxp that I bought used with low hours that was sitting uncovered for some time. This ski was heavily oxidized on the bottom on the black hull I wiped the product on and buffed the whole ski and the oxidization was gone. My whole ski looked brand new it never had a shine like this since I bought it. It was very time consuming took 3 hours but worth every minute for the outcome. Great product worth every penny I priced out similar cleaning products well over 60 dollars for similar products. Now I am ready for Memorial Day weekend with my ski looking new. Highly Recommended!!!
187956,2,"I was very very disappointed when i received the package, only to find one connector for the Aeromotive fuel regulator instead of three as shown in the picture above.Now i have no other choice but to purchase two more additional connectors which is very expensive for plastic feel product in order to use my Aeromotive fuel regulator."
163853,1,"Easy to install. These did have a different way of tightening the bolt down, as there is a place for a 14mm open end wrench to hold the bolt while tightening. OE has allen wrench in the end. No biggie - worked great!"
58884,2,I love the tinkerbell design and the color but the seatcover tore at the seam within the first couple days I had it.
27011,1,"I purchased this filter right after purchasing my used bike. It replaced what looked like the original air filter from 4 years ago. I did not notice any huge improvements in my power and really wasn't looking for any. I just appreciate that the filters are able to be cleaned which definitely saves money in the long run. I was at first disappointed because I thought the air filter didn't fit, I was trying to install it at night. The next morning when I decided to give it another try I realized they ship with longer screws to compensate for the increased width of the gasket. This is the second k&n I have put on my vehicles and as long as they are affordable will be the only air filters I install on my own vehicles or recommend to friends and family."
7210,1,The custom Q clips made for a really good fit on my 05 Toyota Prius.Only complaint is that these didn't come with the same feet as the Q124's that I have on the Rear. The feet on those are half cut so they fit in the rain gutter and are much easier to setup.
135721,0,"I used this product for a while. I would recommend this product but not for someone who has a chunk of stuff on his key chain. I had about 4 keys, one usb drive and this swissgear item. Due to the longer length of this item as compared to standard keys, it is probably subject to uneven forces which causes it to break (the metal loop which loops in the keychain and is the thinnest part). I broke mine within 6 months...so go for it but consider your key chain bunch and the way you (and your kids) use it."
95758,1,"Recently purchased a 2007 Yamaha FZ6 with 10K on it. Previous owner used it as a commuter, as am I. Regular maintenance schedule said to replace the air filter so I looked and found the K&N on Amazon for less than the OEM filter. Drops in easily and improved performance and throttle response is definitely noticeable. Would absolutely recommend this item. Ride On!"
105686,0,"Standard ignition modules are what came installed on factory vehicles. I have been replacing defective units on a truck I've owned since 1975. The first time I had a unit failing, I replaced it with a cheap knock off unit from a discount automotive store. It didn't last no time at all, in fact it had a 30 day guarantee. I have never had an outright failure with these Standard units. They signal their end with an intermittent misfire. At least Standard stands behind their unit with a 5 year, 50,000 mile warranty. To date, I always ran out of time before my unit starts to fail. I'm glad to see these available on Amazon, my local auto parts stores quit selling this unit. They sell the cheap unit and a much more expensive unit, it's less expensive here. An update, got the unit, and unfortunately, it is now made in China."
140252,0,I am not sure this did what it was supposed to do as my daughters car continued with the same issues.
98132,2,"Terrible product. When I bought it, I had no idea that it was two metal pieces welded together. As soon as I turned the wrench, the smaller piece snapped right off. Please save your money."
89050,1,"I bought this heater for my snowmobile and it was easy to install and works perfectly....follow the directions , which are simple for positioning of the heater,,,, and your good to go. i love it"
117941,1,Q-clips are the piece that ties a Yakima tower to your car. These are well made and fit perfectly on my new/old 2001 Nissan Frontier King Cab.
31785,1,"Fit well: I bought one size larger for overpants and that worked.Finish/Durability: Seem sturdy and well made, but I've only had them for 1 month.Features: I can get them on and off over boots. Good venting through long leg zips. Good protectors on knees and hips but none on butt. Ankle fasteners keep them organized around your boots.Cost Benifit/Overall Impression: I feel better protected with them on and like them a lot so far. They might be too warm for long rides during Hawaii summers (on really hot and humid days)even with the liner out and the vents open, but for short rides they should be all right."
54700,0,I bought this because it's a reasonable price for neoprene seat covers. When they came in I really liked their feel and they were easy to install. But I discovered I only got the 2 seat covers and the console cover was missing. I contacted Amazon who promptly shipped me out a new set. I opened the box and again the console cover is missing.I've sent back both sets to Amazon for a refund and I'll be buying them from Coverking directly.
171478,1,"I bought this to replace my Flowmaster 40 series muffler on my V6 Ford Probe, which was way too loud. I took a chance that the Thrush Turbo would be of crappy build, not quiet enough, or wouldn't fit. With the amazing price, and good reviews, I decided to go with it. Here are the results:Build quality: I was pleasantly surprised to see that this muffler is very sturdy. It's heavy for its size, but not so heavy that it adds unnecessary weight to your vehicle (if that's a concern of yours). It's an aluminum muffler, which supposedly may not last as long as a stainless steel muffler, but, IMO, the advantage of SS is overrated. And for $20-$30 replacement cost, who cares.Versatility: The size of the muffler was way smaller than anything else I've seen, which means it will fit in a variety of applications, and removes some of the stress about installing it. I was able to get this muffler put on for under $50 at my local shop. My understanding is that it is reversible, meaning you can install it to flow in either direction. Furthermore, it's a nice open muffler with reduced back pressure over your typical stock setup, which is a nice little bonus, especially if you actually have a turbo (I don't).Sound: I was in love with it from the moment I started the car. At idle, it's got the low, mellow tone of what I would describe as a typical stock V8. Very smooth with no midrange or high end tone. During normal driving (1K to 3K RPM), the tone remains very mellow, even if you goose the throttle a little. It's perfectly acceptable to cruise through the neighborhood without the least bit of discomfort. If you jump on it and do an accel run, the thing comes alive. There is a minor rasp around 4K, but it's barely noticeable, and it's quickly supplanted by a sporty, yet refined timbre all the way to the top. That being said, it's still far from the loud aggression that will draw the attention of the cops as you drive by them (trust me, I know where that threshold is all too well).Overall, this muffler seems to me the best of many worlds, and is the best combination of build quality/sound/price/ease of installation that I have seen. It will probably be my go-to muffler for all of my cars from now on - even my wife's car. She doesn't care about tone or performance, but if she needed a new one, this is so cheap and versatile that it doesn't make sense to look at anything else (an OEM muffler would certainly be more)."
42634,2,"Right now my rating is 1 out of 5 due to the fact that it was broken when it arrived, may change when a new one arrives"
61726,0,"The good thing about this polish/wax is that it doesn't dry up white, just a true haze, so it doesn't get stuck on edges and grooves like other car waxes. Those who wax their cars know exactly what I'm talking about. Overall, this is a good polish. My car is shiny now. But does it do a good job hiding scratches, swirl marks, blemishes? Not really. Mind you, my car is fairly new and the scratches and blemishes I'm talking about are not deep scratches at all. It did hide them, but only a little bit. I wouldn't say they're invisible, but it's a good alternative to having to get a paint job or something. I'm going to keep using this product. Maybe after a few coats of this, it'll keep making the car look and shine better. The chipstick...well, I don't know if I'm just not going over some scratches enough, but it's not a miracle worker. Again, it's decent, but not that great. I'd keep using it just to see if layering it would work for me better."
175800,1,It's easy to use and conveniently folds away. Unfortunately it doesn't cover or fit the windscreen properly and I have a small hatchback. But it does reflect the heat and there is a noted difference in temperature within the car.
162676,0,"Have one on a Buick Skylark. I like the leave it in 50,000-100,000 miles. I skip the cleaning kit, as it is $12...for $42 I can buy a new filter, and after that mileage, I do not want a used one. So I do not clean it at all, better cost effective is throw it away after 100,000 and install a new one. Cleaning kit is not cost effective, just buy and install a new one. Yes, it is supposedly guaranteed for one million miles, or 10 years, but that is stretching it.....after 100,000 miles, I have my money's worth. Out it goes."
39160,2,"Good quality product but does not fasten securely to my 4rnr mirror. Even with duct tape, it would not maintain a usable position."
173179,1,Great looking and well engineered hitch. Was worried how clunky it would look under the little HHR but looks fine. Great finish and fit. Installed in about an hour including jacking and putting in jack stands. Instructions say you only have to enlarge passenger side rear hole but there is no clearance for the fish wire spring on driver's side unless it comes out just at the start of the thread on the bolt. I gave it a slight wiggle with 1/2 drill bit and went quick.
169106,1,"I received the mask promptly and it was exactly as described. I was afraid it might have an icky plastic smell but it didn't at all,which I was relieved about because it was a gift. The only reason i didn't give it 5stars is because wasn't as breathe able as i thought but its stil comfortable at least thats what my husband tells me thanks"

184044,0,"Conceptually this is a great product. Unfortunately the hitch receiver on my Toyota Land Cruiser is very flush to the bumper. The lock mechanism is too big / space is too tight to fit the lock on the pin.On the other hand, this works great on my Nissan Pathfinder since the hitch receiver sticks out a bit."
133812,1,"Small, visually appealing flasher that easily attaches to the IR sensor window of hidden audio/video components. Works perfectly in conjunction with the Buffalo IR-100 IR receiver (see my review of that product). Highly recommended,"

So I'm buying another one but not from CTA."
122238,0,Remote works as designed. Amazon shipping was unacceptable. Lost first one took too long to replace :o(
170396,2,"I received the booster with instructions to charge it for 18 hours, so plugged the charger in. Fifteen minutes later it began sqealing, and the charge light started pulsing. It would not put out any current, so shipped it back to Amazon."
24248,0,"extension-mirrors appear to be as described but do not fit my truck with the little insert bracket part...maybe that fits mirrors that do not have chrome trim on them (my truck has chrome) Have not had a road trip with the units at hwy speeds but they appear to be much more stable than the strap-on mirrors I had b4. I think I will use a small bottle cap in place of the insert bracket under the clamp-on screw and tie the units onto the truck mirror with a short string (run thru a 1/4"" hole drilled thru the bottom of the extension-mirror) just to be sure the wind does not blow them off. They fit snug without this precaution but we have some awsome crosswinds in this area."
151004,2,I bought these lights to fill in the black holes left and right of the single narrow high beam halogen headlamp on a 2008 Triumph Sprint ST. Not much help because the beams are not focused; a lot of light scatters to the sides and overhead; little reaches out to 100 ft. Small size does make for flexible installation options.

20733,1,"My '55 Chevy with a 350/350 would maintain a reasonable temp while moving along at least 35MPH, even in this Houston summer heat that tops out over 100 almost every day. But Houston is also famous for its hair-pulling traffic, which is where I had trouble with my conventional fan/shroud set up. Stopped at a light, the temp would quickly go from 190 to 210/220 and couldn't use the A/C because that would just exacerbate the problem. Once I got thru a light and moving again the temp would drop about 10 degrees before the next light but then I'd be right back to over heating again.I installed the FLX-400 on to the back of my stock 22"" X 18"" radiator. Had to modify the shroud a little at the bottom radiator hose to make it fit but once that was done it fit snugly up against the radiator core and the mounting hardware provided made it relatively easy to secure it. I wired it up according the instructions and set the thermostat for 185 degrees. Now it works perfectly even with the A/C on.Note, I did have to also replace my 60 AMP Alternator with 100 AMP one due the additional draw from the fan. I was looking for an excuse to buy a chrome alternator anyhow.This is a GREAT fan."
164149,0,"My title pretty much sums up what this seat cover is. When you first take it out of the package you will be overwhelmed with the terrible smell this seat cover produces. I let it sit out for half a day and it still reeked of cheap plastic.Once put on though, it does LOOK very nice. I have a black car, and love the red accents on the seat cover.But keep in mind, you get what you pay for. This FEELS very cheap and does not feel like it will last very long at all. I will come back and give updates on the longevity of this item, and in the mean time I will go Febreze my car for the thousandth time."
28558,1,"I have these gloves in black (the ""stealth"" version where the leather is not perforated) and they are by far my favorites.Sizing / Fit:I have small hands, and usually wear a small or medium in ladies' gloves. I bought a women's small in these and they fit great. I also have med. length fingernails (maybe about 1/3 inch past my fingertips) and they pose no problem in the gloves.Look / Feel:These are great all-leather gloves that feel great the first time you wear them. They don't look all bulgy and huge like other motorcycle gloves that I've tried -- which is really important to me! I wear them while riding my Vespa and they just blend right in. The protection in the knuckles looks a little crazy in the pictures, but it looks totally fine on your hands. It doesn't stick out much and you don't look funny wearing the gloves when you're not on your bike.Warmth:As I stated above, I have the non-perforated version, so that's the only one I can comment on. These gloves are great for daytime riding in mild weather. Sometimes when I ride my Vespa late after work and it's cooled off outside my hands are really cold by the time I get home. I tried wearing these in the winter for riding (ok, Northern Cali winter.. so we're talking 40-50 degrees mostly) and they were not warm enough. My hands were freezing and after driving a couple of miles going 50-55. By the time I would get home my fingers would be practically numb. I tried wearing another pair of thin gloves under them to keep warm but the fit is so close that practically nothing would fit. I also tried jamming some of those hot packs into the palms, which helped a tiny bit, but it still wasn't really bareable because they didn't help my fingers. I eventually just gave up and stopped riding when it was so cold outside (not just because of the gloves, but overall I was just too cold and not willing to wear all sorts of layers when I could just take the car instead :) I don't think the warmth factor is a negative on the gloves at all - as I didn't really expect them to be all-weather gloves.Overall, these are the best gloves I've found for wearing while riding my scooter. The fit, feel, and look are exactly what I wanted. I just need to find an alternative for wearing in colder weather!"
96799,1,Item received packaged well and in excellent shape. Saved a bunch of money buying on Amazon. Replaced in less than 30 minutes. Checked many sites including e bay and this is the place to buy. I got free shipping since I could wait on the part but still got it in appx 5 working days. Thanks Amazon
164814,2,I got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat. Very cheaply made. The white lint from the pad comes off and is a mess to pick up from leather clothes and car seat. Go to dollar store and get microfiber cloth !

20151,0,We used this to connect our irrigation system to the garden faucet as the faucet is in front of the door and without something with an angle would block the door. First this seemed a great piece but after two month it started dripping quite some - which defies the reason for using a drip irrigation to safe water.
23553,1,I like that this helmet does not have a chin piece because it's lighter for a little kid. I worry they will get whip lash trying to support a huge helmet. The mat black finish hides scratches much better than a gloss finish.

123591,1,This bag was filled completely for our family of 9 trip from Baltimore to SC. It was very durable and when it rained nothing got soaked. I did purchase two 12 feet straps for extra security because we knew we would maximize the space and boy did we. Our bag was the most looking stuffed bag the entire 12 hrs that it took for us to get there! Well worth the money and the best price was with Amazon.com-trust me I have looked.

Without these I could not see my trailer either from the rear view mirror or side mirrors. dropping the tailgate was not possible due lack of room. The guides were easy to install and work well. My only complaint is I was missing a vinyl cap for one of the guides. The directions included show a different installation picture than the one on the box, but it's no big deal."
50715,1,"Amazon quickly helped me find the exact fit for my new truck. I am not an engineer and have no way to test filters, but my dad and a couple mechanics I've known swore by WIX. Not readily available locally. Amazon's price was competitive with other quality filter brands."
78191,0,"The product fits well, but the material is too thin to retain it's shape well and not pliable enough to stay in contact with the floorboards. I was expecting a heavier, more rubbery material that would conform well to the floorboards. The plastic and light weight of these liners allow them to shift position on the floor, then retain a deformed shaped as a result.Seems like they should last a long time. Would be great if automakers and the floor liner companies would come up with an attachment system to standardize on (velcro???). floormats/liners moving around has been an age old problem."
106942,2,"I just re-read the description, and the above seat cover description is a gross misrepresentation. It incorrectly, if not fraudulently indicates that the covers were customized to fit my specific model. The covers are a sloppy fit, especially on the passenger side, and the controls that are not completely covered are available only through wide sloppy generic openings obviously made to account for any number of general configurations."

48900,0,"You dial the pressure you want and turn it on; it shuts off automatically. It's loud, but quick on bike tires. For car tires, it takes longer of course. My only complaint is that turning it on and off requires unpacking the long cord for DC (""cigarette lighter"") power supply, and it's tightly packed. Then you have to pack it back in and I'm afraid the flimsy door over the compartment will eventually break. I'll probably put the cord in a little sack to make it easier. The AC cord is very short -- seems like it was designed mostly for filling tires on a road trip. But it works, that's what I was looking for. It will also be fine set up as a stationary ""pumping station"" in the garage for bikes and cars."

61999,1,"Shipment was quick and well-packaged. Very simple process of replacing the existing bulb & lense hood. Beam from the LED is bright, has the typical LED light source blu-ish hue and focus of the light seems tighter. Since I use this flashlight sporatically, I can't attest to what battery life improvement is attained, but LED's have a well-documented track record of efficiency over incandescent bulbs. I also have a new larger 3AAA MagLite with their 3 watt LED and I believe this bulb has the same light output. Want to resurrect an old trusty AA MagLite and extend battery life, this is a definite option."

It is a simple construction and I can say the brush part still works and is intact. Also the brush is sturdy and it has never scratched my car. I recommend it but you should buy a spare. I'm not a reckless brute with tools and it did break so be warn. Of course in New Jersey I don't consider the winters to necessitate a better/more expensive snowbrush."

123999,2,I Bought These filters for a 2002 Suzuki 800 Marauder VZ-800.They Do Not Fit. You can not put high flow filters on this bike. I strugled for mounths trying to adjust the carb but it was imposable. Finaly I had to spend more money and buy OEM filters. Don't wast your money If You have a Suzuki VZ-800.
116419,1,"Our Toilet was leaking near one of the bolt, so we read online that we can replace the bolts inside the toilet to fix the problem. The video instructed to use Teflon Sealant. And this worked great.Too bad we don't have to replace this old Toilet with a new one that would've cost us more than $200 to replace."
40676,0,These are well made since they're created out of plastic with brass threads inside. The only problem will be if used on newer cars having Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems. If your valve stems are made of aluminum they will not like brass because the stem is basically an electrified antenna. These will weld themselves by galvanic action once driven on salty roads (an electrochemical process in which one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in electrical contact and immersed in an electrolyte). I almost destroyed one valve stem getting the cap off. Just one TPMS valve runs about $55 plus tire removal and balancing - $100 potential loss per a tire. Other than that they are great and look nice.

133255,2,"I had a Torza Top on my 2001 Silverado for several years and loved it. However, for the 2007 (new body style) Silverado it has been junk. While my earlier one stayed nice and tight going down the road, the vinyl on this one flops all over and drives you crazy because you can see it in your rear-view mirror. I took the first one back to where I bought it (not Amazon, but a local dealer), and they tried sealing up the bed so no air got underneath it. That didn't help, so they ordered me a new one under warranty. However, the second one is even worse. I felt bad about repeatedly taking it back to the dealer, so I emailed the company to inquire what the problem is 3 times now over the past 6 weeks, and they won't even respond. There is some kind of mfg issue with this cover, as the vinyl is just way too loose. I'm continuing to try to get this resolved with the company, but for now this product is unacceptable, as is their customer service."
94374,1,"So, when I wired these horns to test them before mounting them on my bike and running the wire for real, they were so loud that I had second thoughts about mounting them as close to me as I had planned. My weenie OEM horn seemed pathetic by comparison to these car-like red monsters. Seriously. Be scrupulous about your hearing pro if you are going to use these on a motorbike. I am positive there will be flinching and swerving by the first cager who doesn't pay attention. Not that big a deal to wire if you use your OEM horns' original wires to hook into the supplied relay. They are pretty large (nearly 5"" D @ and 2""+ deep), so finding a place to mount them, especially on a naked bike like mine will be a bit of a challenge. But if you figure it out, these are very much bang for your buck, decibel wise. Two tones. Reassuringly, though scarily loud. Highly recommended for all bikers who need more audio defense than their sqeeky toy original horns. They are also big and red, but you'll survive that."

105501,2,"The LIM gasket in this set may eventually leak at the water jackets. There's just not enough beef on these red ones to hold the jackets on this tight engine design. The updated gasket set from Felpro uses beefier Permadry ""BLUE"" rubber seals on a plastic frame. It uses the same exact part number and is available at local parts stores. Felpro also makes a set that uses a metallic frame and big black rubber seals. But the seals are so big they get pinched off and can fall down into the intake port, which I'v seen happen."

I have to say that I'm really pleased with these guys. I've put them through their paces and my windshield is clean. No streaking, no missed spots, no smearing. I'd have to recommend them. Finally, a good wiper. I'm putting four stars because I'm reserving the fifth star to see how they hold up over the long run. And since there's not any snow right now we don't get to see how they perform in ice. Highly recommended."
35806,2,I bought the Tinker Bell wheel cover and the floor mats to match. Within less than six months all the white color parts of the Tinkerbell wheel cover changed to brown. The mats are still ok. I am just guessing but I thought it may be due to the sun or summer heat.

134313,0,"I purchased this as a replacement to another fire style nozzle that someone liberated from my hose recently. The two annoying things that this hose does that my last one didn't do is 1)the pressure build up when the hose is left on (when I am washing my car, for example) is apparent when I attempt to turn it back on at the twist mechanism, it puts up pretty strong resistance then 2) when it finally does turn on, it gives goes from 0 to 60 in .5 seconds, shocking the user from the blast of pressure.This nozzle is just OK and does not live up to the 5 star reviews. AT least this holds true for the 2012 model. Better to go with the Carrand 90049 Fire Hose Nozzle on Amazon for much less $ and more consistency. I ended up purchasing another Carrand after seeing how sticky the Bonaire model was. I am sorry I didn't go back to it right away, but I thought this would be an upgrade. It looked and felt like a better product, but fell short on performance."

They are PVC plastic, and I discarded them for this use and got galvanized steel brackets instead to mount the four panels, which are large, on the deck of my boat.The instructions, or lack thereof, are woefully inadequate and do not even describe the correct procedures and assembling orders for the unit.However, the unit itself is very simple to assemble (the hardest part of mine was the bracket installation and getting the wires to the battery in my tiny stern compartment). The solar panels were easy to install, the wiring logical and easy to connect, and the indicator worked.The only element that didn't work, at all, was the inverter. It was WAY too small and shouldn't be sold with the unit. At 200W it blew out instantly. They should have included a 350W inverter, and I recommend listening to the Amazon recommendation to get the higher wattage inverter with the unit, and through out or sell the 200W unit. I got one from Radio Shack for 350W and it works fine.I've had my panels on and running for about a month now and they work great. The only thing to remember is that they are essentially a battery recharger unit, not a true dedicated power source. Your power comes from the 12V battery, and the panels recharge that. If you run out of juice in the battery, your done for the day.Overall, I would recommend this product to my friends, with the caveats that I mentioned above. It is a cheap, effective method of getting power where you need it when you need it, charges the batteries on my boat in about a day, and lets me do what I wanted it to let me do: have a small source of power to run my computer and keep my cell phone charged. I am happy with this purchase, but would recommend that for larger power uses, you go with the marine-grade panels - they are smaller, only need one panel instead of 4, and cost about twice to three times what this is. You'll need to get more than one unit of this type anyway if you need more power, and with the inefficient type of panels used, you will run out of room on your boat, or RV, to place them, before you get the power you want."
6798,0,"We bought these chains after our last set broke. At more that twice the cost of anything else we reviewed I had very high expectations.They are reasonably easy to put on but, because they rely on rubber fasteners to provide cable tension, they don't work well at speeds above 25MPH. They make an awful noise. I had to pull over 5 times in the course of one trip from Tahoe to let cars in chains and SUV's pass. Other chains that take a bit more work to put on ultimately perform better because they have less play. These chains have no way to adjust the length.I've had cheaper models that work better. I used the chains on a Saab 9-3.Turns out having to pull over on a snowy road to let people pass is a lot more dangerous than being able to go with the flow of traffic."

120865,0,"My wife purchased this Timing Light for me as a Christmas gift and it has some of the nicest features you could imagine. Only one problem though, it does not function with any vehicle that has an aftermarket MSD or Mallory ignition system installed. It functions sporadically when these type of ignition system are installed on your vehicle and the MSD website confirms this as well. Many timing lights have trouble reading the MSD's capacitive discharge multiple sparks. Dial back timing lights are not recommended either.Very disappointing that I must send back this full featured Timing Light because it simply does not work with MSD (Multiple Spark Discharge) ignition systems."
30367,1,"I have always held a preference for Bendix brand products. Their products have always fit and performed flawlessly on my vehicles and these pads are no exception. The pads are quiet and low dusting while providing stopping performance near that to more aggressive pads. These pads have been long lasting, so far almost twice that of the OE pads and still going strong. The non-metallic compound in these also save from excessive rotor wear and generate less heat creating less brake fade and reduce the chances for rotor warpage. If there is a downside, these pads do not have the ultimate ""grip"" of OE or more aggressive pads creating the need to press the brake pedal farther/ harder than normal, but stopping performance overall seems to still match OE pads under hard breaking.I would highly recommend these to anyone and I will likely get them again."
162322,1,"I have a truck-camper and needed to tow a little trailer behind. The camper reaches 40 inches behind the original truck hitch. Because I couldn't find a 36/40 inch hitch extender, I bought this tube, went to our local metal shop, bought a 1ft 2x2x1/4inch metal for $8 and went to our local welding shop. They welded the 2x2 inside the 36inch receiver and drilled a 5/8th hole in it. Now I have a fully workable 40inch hitch extension that worked great on our trip from FL to NY and back.The only thing I didn't like a the receiver tube was the heavy fin inside the tube.

I guess that maybe sitting on it compresses the air channels that carry it to the back area? that must explain it - after a while, it just wasnt worth hearing the EXTRA LOUD FAN and lowering my mpg by using power (mostly the noise). too bad, I think it would be worth it otherwise but as it stands, I cannot recommend it."

I buy tons of stuff off the internet because I just don't have the time to get all my errands done through the week and I'm certain not wasting my weekends doing it.Amazon is at the top of my three best sites that I use when looking at price: Amazon, Craigslist and Ebay. I use others like for my sports supplements, GNC, for instance. Amazon is a pro because they have a backend system that reliably takes care of me in case something happens, i.e., no delivey, wrong parts, etc. It really doesnt matter what you order, Amazon ships fast and stays in touch throughout the process with updates and feedback and this is what keeps me as a customer.Everything has always been as described on Amazon that I received because they run a tight vendor program, so as long as you know what you are getting is the correct part, item, etc., you shouldn't have a problem with an Amazon buying experience.

One on the retaining spring clamp did not fit. The bracket arm to hold up the tube was also useless. The black tube is made of pvc plastic and not metal. The vacuum house nozzle is made of plastic, so be careful not to break it. Not sure if it gave the vehicle more power, but it made it sound much better. It gives it that ""Growl"" noise when you punch the gas.Overall, this cold air intake is not bad. Price is little bit high considering a pvc tube with a filter attached to the other end."

188305,2,"I have had 3 of these now, and they've all had the same defect:First one I used for a week or so, then it began squealing on startup. As soon as I'd plug it in, it would begin squealing and not spiinning enough to produce power. If I don't do anything it stays that way, so I must tap or smack it one to 8 times to get it going. Then it usually works fine until I finish using my laptop - until the next day when the issue repeats.I contacted Targus and they sent another and I returned the first. Unfortunately, they didn't bother to inspect it when they got it back, so they have no idea what caused it.The second one worked for a few days, then the same problem started. Targus sent another. That one worked fine the first day, and squealed the next. Been using it almost a week now, and it squeals every day. Had to smack it many times this morning. Seems to be somewhat related to the cold weather, as if the lubricant inside gets too thick when it's cold, and after running for 10 seconds or so the parts can turn more freely.Recorded a video of the issue with my webcam, but Targus doesn't want to see it. They tell me this problem isn't inherent to this model, but I beg to differ. Strange the other reviewers didn't note this issue. This occurs as soon as I plug it in, BEFORE I plug in my laptop. My car has a brand new battery, and I've checked the voltage coming from the 12v outlet while the unit was squealing, and it was over 13 volts. At Targus's suggestion, I plugged it into another vehicle and the same thing happened. Obviously say the issue is in the inverters, not my car.Now I still have a squealing inverter (using it now). If I had a receipt I'd return it, but I can't find it so I'm stuck with it. The first one I had to pay to return, the second one they sent a free shipping label.Targus did offer to send ANOTHER, but I see no point.

60820,1,"I've been a Yamaha guy all my life, until 2005 when I needed a commuter for living and working in Seattle, where the ferry is $30 roundtrip for a car, ut only $8 for a motorcycle. My '00 SV650 is my first Suzuki... and I love it.It was a used buy from an engineer who wanted a track queen to trailer, ride hard, then put away until the next. It came with the K&N; gauze filter above, so its entire life with me has been without the expensive and non-cleanable/non-reusable stock cloth air filter.Another one of our group of friends has the same year, same-spec SV, but in slightly different tune. He however chose to stick with the stock filter, modified.In the time we've both owned our SVs, I've just cleaned and re-oiled the filter. He's gone through umpteen stock filters, and has to mod them everytime perfectly like the last one, which is a pain as the original SV650 has a clearance issue with the underside of the tank, and the opening to the filter, which is the opening to the airbox. The only thing about owning a K&N;, is careful adherence to cleaning and oiling procedure -- it's really, really easy to under/overoil. But once you learn how, it's a snap -- just takes about an hour to allow for proper drying and oiling.I've solved that last bit about the time lag prepping the filter... by buying two. That way one is always clean and ready to drop in, while you can take your time and do right to the other filter. Expensive? Perhaps... but they always act the same, always give me the same mpg, same performance. Can't say the same about my friend and his adventures in Dremelling ABS plastic... not to mention he's spent a lot more than even the cost of two K&Ns; in five years of riding. ;)Pros: More cost-effective in the long run than stock filters. No need to modify the housing to get the flow improvement.Cons: Pricey.Conclusion: I can clean and service my air filter when I choose to, in any interval, without depending on the mail or a dealer. If you have the cash to spend on a K&N; for the 1st-gen SV650/S, do it. With proper attention to jetting, even the bone stock SV will wake up nicely AND use less fuel. ;)EDIT 29 JUL 2012: I've noticed in the course of servicing and using both K&Ns;, that the earlier one that came with the bike has a flaw; let me elaborate.When K&N; first debuted their stock replacement for the 99 - 02 SVs, it had a major flaw -- the opening into the filter was too small and a lip rising above the surface of the exterior of the opening, obstructed airflow. Many owners complained, and the filter was updated: a larger opening, with a radiused edge, to smooth airflow into the airbox. This version was a solid performer, as I've campaigned the bike on the track with no running problems whatsoever -- since I'd had no other K&N;'d SV to compare it to, I accepted its slightly burblier running.However, there was one remaining flaw they'd only fixed recently: the corners of the ""baseplate"" of the filter housing which hold the filter in the airbox, was molded with clearance under them in the first revision -- screwing the filter down, bent the corners before touching the airbox, and as a result the seal can be warped and compromised. I've compared both filters, and the newer one has a much thicker ""baseplate"" -- now screwing it in just puts pressure on the seal a bit before the baseplate touches the airbox. Metering is very consistent when this filter is in (and the proper K&N; hi-temp grease is used on the seal). It doesn't matter with the older one if grease is used or not; tightening the screws distorts the baseplate enough to let air past it and cause a bit of weird low-rpm and coastdown popping. Nothing is wrong with its seal, it's pliable and in good condition. This older ""Mk II"" revision also will crack where the bending stresses the baseplate.So if you do get a chance to try this filter used a la Craigslist, or as an included mod on a seller's 1st-gen SV, make sure when screwed down, the corners of the baseplate don't visibly distort; should be straight as an arrow when installed. If so, get a newer one, or it'll leak. Had no idea how well the bike ran off-idle and coasting down, until I ran the newer filter -- way better. :)"

These mats are pretty well designed but could be better in my opinion.
47315,0,"What's good about this product? It's cheap and easy and produces good results.What's bad? It doesn't produce great results. Other Meguiar's products will, though.This product attempts to polish small scratches and spider webbing out of your paint, then fill remaining scratches, and then provide a wax coating. If you paint doesn't have small scratches or other defects, you don't need a cleaner wax, you just need a regular wax. This product does a good but not great job at polishing scratches. It also does a good job of filling remaining scratches, but this will fade after a few weeks or months. If you want to only use one product, for time and/or money, this will do a good job.If you want to do the job right, you should use Meguiar's Ultimate Compound with a simple random orbital buffer. It will do a much, much better job of removing small scratches and spider webbing than this product. Then you can use Meguiar's Polish to fill remaining scratches (this step is optional, the difference is not huge) and finish with a Meguiar's wax like the NXT Tech Wax. The NXT wax will last much longer than this cleaner wax, so ultimately it will save you time."
147051,0,"I have bought too many road trip bags in search of the perfect bag. This unfortunately is not it, for me, anyway. But it might be for someone else -Pros:TONS of pockets, some with labelsTapered straps, so it theoretically would wrap around your hipVery cool looking - the white is great if you can keep it clean, and it's pretty easy to clean - bleach gets anything out. And the slick material doesn't soak a whole lot up.Cons:No water bottle pocket, something else on the side that is frustratingly just slightly too small.Many of the pockets are only big enough to hold one or two items others are enormous, but nothing for like a toothbrush, but a few for like office supplies, I don't know. Doesn't seem like the pockets were well thought out.White gets dirty really fast, especially on road trips.The strap is not adjustable. I am 5'5"" and the strap was way too long for my comfort. I wanted the strap to start wrapping around my hip, but it starts wrapping around my buttocks. The top of the bag sits around thigh height, impossible to walk for very long with. I had to fold the strap over at the top and safety pin it."

133768,0,"The price on this Coleman line is decent; it doesn't seem to get as many positive reviews as other inverters. I was having trouble with mine powering some power tools off my truck's 12v batt, tools in the 7-8Amp range (900-960 watts). The alarm would go off and the unit would shut down. I was sure the inverter was a dud until I started experimenting with the cables. I ended up using the biggest, fattest cable I could find to connect it to the battery--and keeping it as short of a cable run as possible--and that solved the problem. The 13.5A (1620watt) circular saw still wouldn't work, but it isn't fair to expect that from a unit rated at only 1000watts continuous. If you're triggering that alarm frequently, upgrade to the heaviest gauge cable you can and see if that does the trick..."

176689,1,This was a great kit compared to the K&N kit I replaced it with. Fitment was much better than my last kit.
27002,2,I have been waiting for this product well beyond any reasonable timeframe. I could have bought it and paid just a little more and had it in 3 days. Amazon must be sourcing this item from the Amazon rainforest by mule train. They are unresponsive to previous inquiry. I will cancel soon.
78970,0,"At first the tire gauge seemed to be handy since it could be hook to my key chain, however if you have many keys on your ring like I do, it becomes annoying trying to use it. It worked well at gauging , no problems there, but sometime in 2010 the chain broke and due to it's small size it was gone for good. I recommend just tossing it in your glove box and not worry about the key ring feature."

15075,0,"There is one major caveat to the use of this product that all potential buyers should be aware of. You MUST have at least 1.3 ft or so between the front of your vehicle and where the unit is mounted. It will not be able to register closer than this distance. If you're purchasing this b/c of a ""tight"" garage, this could be an issue, as it is for me.This seems a little silly, but I thought the point of this unit was to help you park close to the front wall in a tight garage but not bump the wall. However, the instructions clearly state that the range is 1.3 to 16 feet. ""We recommend that you never leave less than 1.3 feet between your bumper and the wall."" This, of course, is kind of ridiculous since if I had 1.3 ft between the front of my car and the front wall, I wouldn't need a parking assist device. When properly parked, my garage allows approximately 4"" of clearance front and rear in total (e.g., 2"" up front, 2"" in rear if centered). Thus, I have .25 ft. The unit simply flashes red about 1.5ft before I get pulled into the proper position and then goes off.This may be fine if you have lots of room in your garage and need to park in a very particular position among the piles of stuff, but if you have a particularly tight garage, it may not serve your needs."
98864,2,"I got these because I thought it would be nice to have brighter back up bulbs, but because they are blue they really darken the light housing and make it look well....blue. More than I anticipated they would. Then I tried them in the red brake light side and even there it darkened it to a ruby red that looked funny because of the blue color. They are nice and bright when working, but unless your looking for a blue lens housing look, stick with a clear/amber/chrome bulb. Also, pretty pricy for a small simple bulb."

114609,1,"I purchased a different jacket when I first got my motorcycle, but I only used it for about six months before needing a new one. In my local shop, they had no plus-sized women's jackets, so I was wearing a men's jacket, and the plates weren't in good places to be protective in case of an accident. This jacket runs true to size, and seems more durable than the other brand of jacket I had (Joe Rocket). The two separate zip-out liners are very convenient and easy. I am very happy with the fit and quality. I ride about two hours a day, on the interstate, and my old jacket started to fray at certain seams after only a month or so. I have had this one for over a month, and there are no signs of wear. In addition, the jacket is comfortable from 95 degrees down to 50 degrees (with appropriate clothing underneath, of course). It may work in even colder weather, but I haven't ridden in anything colder than 50. Overall, I'm really, really pleased with this purchase!"

This extra piece is about $35 right now on Amazon, so factor that into your cost calculations.I can tell you that other than missing the Windshield Channel, this product is very tough and solidly built. I did, however, return mine because a half-bikini top (to me) isn't worth the $90+ that the two pieces together cost in order to make this work."
94708,2,I bought one but could not use it znc had to return it. It requires another tool attached to the end of it to be used. Ordinary wrenches will do the same job.
107994,0,"Screws are cheap, put too much torque and they snap, problem is the instructions don't state the size of the hole to drill for the mounting screws.There aren't enough wires in the package to do the job. The lights themselves need one wire connected to ground, but the wire on the light ends in a male bullet connector, the wire is too short to reach anywhere, and there is no female grounding wire provided.Same with the switch, a battery and a light wire are provided, but no ground wire.The instructions are not for this light, but for a similar oval light. The mounting instructions do not state which direction on the bracket is forward; additionally, they state that there is a drainage hole on the light which should be face-down, the rectangular light does not seem to have a drainage hole.Finally, there is nothing that states what the replacement bulb number is, hopefully (when that time comes) it won't be hard to identify."
118836,1,Yakima sells great fitting products such as the recent q-clips for my 9-5 Saab. Amazon is the best place to purchase mostly anything as their discounts and free ship is awesome!
22446,2,"I ordered 4 of these for my shop. I had used them many years ago and was happy to find them on Amazon. I looked at several and saw some had a square, black handle and others had the red, hex shaped handle, like I had used in the past. So, I ordered what I thought was the red handled one, but what showed up were 4 of the black square ones.Now, it doesn't really effect the actual functionality of the product. However, the red ones are easier to see up under a dash and are just a nicer quality. These black ones appear to be a cheap redesign by Thexton. Seriously, if I had known this is what Amazon was selling in place of the red one, I wouldn't have bought it."
164740,0,"Energy Suspension has great products, but this one, although specifically listed for a 2004 mustang, does not have end links long enough to fit.

144645,1,"I am almost 73 years of age and remember the time when gasoline was to be bought for 0.20 to 0.25 cents a gallon in service stations found on almost every corner of the major intersections in a city or town. In those days every station provided &#34;FREE&#34; air for your car tires and the tire inflator with built in gauge looked and operated just like this Milton dual chuck Tire Inflator with Gauge. The new gauge I received was easy to install on my air hose and easy to use as I checked the pressure in all of my tires and add the required air or release any extra air pressure that existed all in one operation. So much better than checking with a gauge, removing gauge, adding air, rechecking, often having to add more air (or release any extra air I inadvertently added), then rechecking with gauge until I finally get the proper reading of PSI on the one tire. The material this gauge is made from looks to be top quality and very sturdy."

It took less than an hour to install and it is very easily rolled up against the cab when you need access to the bed. While it is not theft proof, since you have to open the tailgate to open the cover gives more security than an open bed."
160477,0,"well what can i say? this thing runs cool all the time you are cruising and freeway/interstate traffic, once you get into traffic tho, the engine temp goes up to 210 on the gauge and sits there. i was worried after i installed this with my new water pump that it was faulty and my engine would overheat. But as soon as you get on the freeway after traffic the engine cools off basck to the 180/185 mark. tbh as and when i have to get a new thermostat i will go back to the ac-delco one. This isnt as good as they make it out to be."
174628,0,"Device is OK, but the tubing should be redesigned. They use cheap tubing that becomes brittle after use, and the rubber stoppers they use remind of a child's chemistry class. For the cost of this device, the tubing needs to be longer, and the fittings need to be air-tight brass quick disconnect. This is 2009, and it's ridiculous to sell a product that leaks air like a sieve. Also tubing gets VERY hot when draining the oil, so wear gloves. While I was able to drain the oil from my Porsche Boxster, since it low to the ground; I had to lift the tank up in the air to drain the oil from my Jeep Grand Cherokee. How frigging much would it have cost to have made the lines 2 to 3 feet longer??? The pro's are that they include 3 sizes of tubing along with a hose that I think is to be used to bleed your brakes."
71395,1,I used the clay system to remove specs of tree sap from my new car's paint as well as from the windows.

That would have been nice to know before I bought it. But none of the other mirrows on the market made any comment of that either."
111575,1,This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. The key with the cleaner is to knock out all the junk out of the filter before applying the cleaner. Then allow the cleaner to soak in.I applied the oil in even coats and tried to avoid over oiling the filter; so I ended up oiling it three times to get the right amount on the filter.I definitely enjoy not having a one time use filter.

184798,0,"The Tourmaster/Cortech DSX denim motorcycle pants are what I was looking for to ride in the warmer weather. They are comfortable while riding since they seem to be more breathable than the padded motorcycle pants that I usually wear. Denim, though, can be really oppressive in the hot humid weather when you finally get to your destination.I find that the plastic knee protectors (which are removable) tend to bother me when walking around because the top of the protector hits the bottom of my knee cap unless I pull the pants way up around the top of my waist. In that case I take the protectors out."

It does take a little getting use to as far as handling goes depending on the size of your windshield. I have a Honda Civic so the shade is rather large. For me, with my small hands its awkward to hold onto and roll up. In my opinion its worth every penny."

We had to tape the straps and rips halfway home to ensure it made it. Ridiculous!"

158666,1,"A. C. Bevan's review is right on the money. You need to prepare the cover, gather the right tools, and take your time to get this to come out right:- Prepare the cover by enlarging the existing holes with an awl or ice pick. There are hundreds of holes, just take your time (maybe an hour).- Have a pair of needle nose pliers handy- Set aside at least 4 hours for the actual installation onto your steering wheelTaking your time is the key. I got best results by loosely lacing a large section, then going back to tighten the lacing by using the needle nose pliers. I have not broken a needle during the lacing process.Getting the cover to lie flat at the wheel spokes can be tricky. I actually use a seperate loop of lace going thru the cover holes and around the wheel spoke.It's a lot of work, but once it's done, I think it feels much better than the slip-ons, or lace-on vinyl alternatives."

163685,1,"...from DNL Enterprises, but I'm not complaining.Pros:- I like how it doesn't cover any controls, including the hold switch.- It didn't come with a lanyard, but it came with a belt clip. In my opinion, a belt clip is actually better if one were jogging or working out and such.Cons:- Removing the case can be a hassle. No, seriously, it took skill.- It also leaves the display unprotected.I just shaped the screen protector that came with the Nano package to compensate for the last item. Five dollars for a hard-case, I'm not complaining for what I got."
65631,1,I used it all day the day it was delivered. Smells like furniture polish.
30620,0,I ordered the left and right headlight assemblies. Found that they were not sealed well where the 2 halves are gooped together...just not enough sealant was used. I used some RTV (silicone caulk) to try and remedy this on both headlights.Also...the pass side light was not assembled right...the bucket that the bulbs sits in and which is adjustable has a pivot and 2 ball & socket joints that allow the vertical to be adjusted...turns out that one ball & socket was not assembled...so that this light was not adjustable and would bounce around on the road. So I just used a hole saw to make a hole in the bottom of the light....and then used a pair of needle nosed pliers to snap the ball & socket together...then sealed the hole up with RTV and alum sheet....works OK now.Otherwise...the headlights fit reasonably well in the opening and appearance wise look pretty good....and they are plug and play connector wise.Label says Made in Taiwan...but I'd say they were made in China by some overworked people. Poor quality control.I could have returned these with shipping paid for...but then I'd have been right where I started again. So far the lights are acceptable...though the light pattern on the pass side light is a bit off and I still have some condensation when it rains...more sealant needed.As far as aftermarket lights....it's really a jungle out there. Watch the shipping costs and expect some kind of warranty?* I removed and resealed the pass side headlight using RTV....seems that with headlight use and the heat of the sun...the two halves of the light tend to pull apart in places causing leaks and condensation...also used some extra RTV on the driver's side light where a gap opened up on top.

72166,0,"I have used Haynes manuals for about 6 vehicles. All are very detailed and informative. I don't know what happened with this particular manual. First, the paper used reminds me of newsprint and is very fragile! You usually use one of these while you're working on the vehicle. You know, greasy hands and such. This paper doesn't take that too well. So, be careful. Any chemical will ruin the book! They need to revert to the better quality paper.The pictures are very hard to interpret, and most of the pictures provided prove to be useless for what you're doing. I was replacing a transaxle. The parts it told you loosen or remove were incorrect. I had to end up ""fishing"" it.There are no viable electrical diagrams. I had to obtain these from other sources to trace a radio short.The book is also a bit disorganized. Tightening torques and specs are not where they should be. There is very little ""Troubleshooting"" guidance.Haynes produces top-quality books. I just don't know what happened with this one. They should really consider re-editing it."

If you think you getting a premium product from a company that cares about customer service, you will be as disappointed as I am.Note the positive reviews tend to be from new owners. I felt the same way when the product was new. But the quality isn't there over time, nor is customer service."
48507,0,"I will try not to repeat what has been written by other reviewers.This unit replaces my older, excellent A/C only inflator, a Coido 2068 MassAir Inflator. My main reason to purchase the B&D; ASI300 is that unlike others for sale at Amazon, it could be powered by either a A/C house outlet or a DC vehicle lighter power point ... a nice bit of flexibility for someone like me who does most of his inflating at home (car/bike tires, balls, air mattresses, etc.), yet needs to inflate things while on the road (inflating tubes for tubing, balls at soccer practice, etc.).The B&D; inflator seems to work well, albeit somewhat slowly. In fact, when using it on A/C power, inflating road bike tires (size 700c x 28) from completely flat to either 80 or 110 PSI, the B&D; took 55 sec and 82 sec respectively. This is not horrible, but it is a full 45% SLOWER than my 10-year old Coido 2068 inflator ... a little disappointing as I had hoped this newer B&D; unit would be at least as fast.Granted this slowness is not so bad when inflating a bike tire or a soccer ball, but as you can imagine it would get a bit tedious on an air mattress, large exercise ball, or when having to add more than a few PSI to a car tire.If speed of inflation is important to you and the use of A/C power is not a critical factor, check out the Viair 00073 or Q Industries HV35 units instead, they are the same price or cheaper as the B&D; ASI300 but are (according to at least one reviewer), quite a bit faster than other electric inflators selling for less than $50:Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor:[...]Q Industries HV35 SuperFlow 12-Volt 140 PSI Air Compressor:[...]"
71916,0,"Great idea, but the spout is too thick and short for most mowers, making it useless. Its narrower black extension spout is also too short and doesn't support the funnel when extended, and thus it falls out of the tank. And, of course, it doesn't really work with side-loaded tanks. Still, a clever idea, but make sure to measure your tank's opening before dropping the cash for it. Hope version 2.0 fixes these problems."
114133,1,"ive gotten one for my car and i didnt feel the difference.i put this one in my 2008 sportsman 500 HO and it digs off the line noticeably faster.i got it so i dont have to buy a new filter every so often, now i have the one and only one ill ever need for the lifetime of the bike and you should too"

178786,0,"Seems to work pretty well. Wipes the windshield clean without streaks, but chatters a bit. Still new, and only used during the summer. It needs to last at least 3 years and work well in winter to be worth the price."
91852,1,"I received the cover promptly after ordering. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase. I like the material of the car cover and it is doing what I need it to do. Note: While the mid size fits well front-to-back, the sides could be a bit longer for a 2009 Corolla."
25746,0,"I needed to remove several exhaust manifold bolts that had rusted so bad that the heads sheared when trying to get them out. The tool worked on the bolts that had threads left but not on the ones where the rust was so bad no threads remained. To be fair all the bolts only had about 1/4"" of shaft to work with and the really bad ones did not leave much to work with because of the rust."
3273,1,"I got this as a gift for my aunt for a gift to help get the ice off windshield. It works wonderfully (when she doesn't leave it in the trunk that iced over). Very easy to use, not much force to break up ice, was done completely in minutes."
157488,2,"The floor mats fit well. The driver's side mat does not have an eyelet for the retention hook mounted to the floor, and that is disappointing as the description says they exist when ""required"" (and the general photo shows two eyelets). The floor mats are a much lighter gray than the gray interior of the pickup. But the mats are thick and should last a long time.Edit 11/16/2012: I've changed my rating to 2 stars from 4. Now that I've lived with these for a few months, the need for support of the retention hook is apparent. The driver's side mat creeps pretty fast. And just the other day the accelerator pedal got stuck under the mat. Pretty exciting few seconds before I realized what happened. That dangerous condition would NOT happen if it hooked into the pickup's existing retention hook!"

30354,1,"I had ordered this product as a gift for my husband. When he opened the package the two visors were loose in the box, no bubble wrap or foam packaging to keep them from being bounced around during transit. Of course, one of the two visors was broken in multiple pieces - I was so upset. The surprise gift for his birthday was totally ruined. I immediately ordered a replacement for him & returned the broken package the same day. I hope that the next shipment will be packaged a little more carefully! Duh!! The product looked nice but whoever is in charge of packaging should think twice next time.I just wanted to add....today is the day after I wrote the previous review & to my amazement a new package arrived this morning! The visors weren't packaged any differently but, they were not broken & my husband is very happy (and so am I). Thank you Amazon.com for getting us a replacement so quickly - I plan on doing more business with you in the future."
187497,2,My husband bought this a few years ago. We've added air to a few tires and maybe inflated a float or two. Longevity and reliability are not with this model!
6613,2,This was the wrong product. Online listing was incorrect - I had to call manufacturer for correct product. Amazon sent a return postage mailer by email. Product returned with no problem.
35579,1,A great price on an OEM quality thermostat. Installed fine and have had no problems.
44041,2,"The item arrived with missing parts, the passenger's side wing was missing, and instead came with duplicated driver's side wings. The item can't be install in these condition.

76936,1,installation onto the motorcycle was very easy. purchased this product because of the K&N name and I am not disappointed. this product does add a little bit more HP.
135648,0,they work but I have read that bosch products dont work well in jeeps which I have. I dont know if its the headers I put in around the same time or these but I lost alot of MPG. if you have a jeep I would recommend the ntk brand
39112,0,"Easy to setup, but mirrors are small and tapered. Better than nothing to see around. Mirrors will slide around and have to constantly reposition and tighten down. When raining, the straps get very loose. I almost lost one before I could find a place big enough to stop. Straps stretch out some when wet I found out. Rubber feet on pads move around. Not sticky enough. Hooks will bend if you tighten too much. Overall not impressed at all. Buying real replacement mirrors."
151873,0,"Contrary to the item description, this is NOT gold on one side. It is silver on both sides.I could have purchased this exact shade (silver-silver) locally for less money at Advance Auto.I wanted the gold side because my car is goldish colored.I'm torn between keeping this, since it was only slightly more expensive than the local cost (with tax) and boxing it up/returning it is a pain -- I see Amazon has dropped the price since I ordered -- and returning it to get the gold-as-pictured shade I saw on Amazon (that shade has mostly unfavorable reviews).This Platinum Jumbo shade is stiff enough that it holds its shape when crammed into corners and doesn't sag, at least when it's new.I support mine with visors that have extender shades on them, but it seems this shade would stay up well enough with visors alone.It's too large at the bottom for my '96 Thunderbird; in order to fully cover the corners and sides, I have to use it at partial length (i.e., one segment folded up).There's about an inch worth of dash across its length that's left exposed to the sun, but inexact fit is to be expected from a generic shade."
119121,2,"First of all, my bad for not noticing that it only runs off of a car lighter-there is no 110v AC plug. It does not show that in the photos.Second, it quickly over-heats and shuts down as soon as the backpressure exceeds 35 lbs. if it is running for a few minutes. Then it will not start again for an hour!It finally quit completely after 2 months. Don't waste your $$."
48685,2,"Noisy, slow, awkward, hard to disconnect from tire, impossible to re-store the hose and DC cord once you take them out. Should have believed the other reviews..."
119271,1,I recently purchased this clip to moumt a Curtis roof rack on top of our 2007 Mitsubishi Galant. Loaded the rack with at least 100 pounds of cargo and took it for a 1200 mile road trip. The clip never gave a hint of budging and was as solid as a rock throuout the entire trip. The hardware was easy to install and removes even quicker!
186699,2,I have a VW Jetta and I thought for sure these would fit my car but they didn't. Luckily I had a friend who has a van that they fit and he bought them off of me. I never found out how he liked them but I surely didn't.
488,0,"These things don't work as well as they should, but they do take out random crap from the air. If you don't like buying stuff to smell your car up like fruitiness, a HEPA filter or something would be what you're looking for. Unfortunately, I don't think they make car HEPA filters. This product is the next best. Besides, it's completely silent unlike HEPA's. Don't expect a miracle, but buy it if you find a good deal."

52396,2,"Tried to install this recently. Discovered I would need a 791 bypass for my vehicle. Put everything in and the car will crank but not start. Move the antenna loop around and shazam it starts. Put everything back together and the car will crank but not start again. Went throught this exercise several times. Bottom line when I put the cover on that goes over the steering column the transponder ring is not effective. I can take the cover off and move the ring near the ignition switch key hole and everthing works. Now if I want to leave the cover off this is a great peice of eqiupment. Of course this will not look like junk and therefore I will not do so.Today I have a vehicle with butchered wiring that will not start with the remote. There is no apparent solution to this problem as tech support is short and unconcerned. I have called and emailed several times. They are quick to talk over you and come off quite cavalier.Bottom line after spending $65 for the unit, $26 for the 791 bypass, $100 for the extra programmed key to go in the 791, the best part of the day installing this thing, and then another day or so troublesooting I would have been much better off spending $200 at Best Buy to have them install one of their units. A buddy of mine did so and has been starting his car remotely while I have not. This is a Rube Goldberg device at best.This may be fine for cars without a security system."
15630,2,"Funny turn of fate, I thought I bought 2 of these, got one, checked, and yes, I messed up and only ordered one. I am SO glad I made that mistake, because one of my headlights you have to take out the battery to change. I decide to put it in the easy side just to test. So, let me take it from the beginning.Install the bulb, standard halogen procedure, don't touch the glass part. Turn it on, no low beam. Check connections, fuses, everything is good. Pull the bulb back out, one of the low beam supports is simply not there, it's a filament floating by one leg. Returned to Amazon, annoying, but it hasn't cost me anything so far except time. I ask them to send me a replacement, it comes in 2 days. Nice!I installed the replacement last night, it's all good. This morning, I hop in, and just for kicks, flash the high beams before I go to work. The low beam stops working. I pulled the bulb, and the low beam filament is vaporized.I did look at the bulb carefully before installing, and noticed the 2 filaments were much closer together than my regular bulb.The Hella website brags about Germany manufacturing standards and excellence. But, these are made in a country other than Germany, a country certainly not known for their manufacturing. I'm not going to insult an entire country in my review. Just know, this is not a German made product.And, oh, the irony... the bulb is marked off road use only. I can't even get one to last out of my driveway and these are supposed to be used off-road?So ends my review on the 80/100W bulb. Do not buy it unless you are ready to swap out and return bulbs to help Hella's quality control effort.I have owned Hella products for the last 10 years. I owned their 550 fog lights and frankly, they weren't that good either. Their covers look cool, but even those were problematic, they get very brittle in the cold and break if you try to take them off. I give up. There are too many high-quality lighting manufacturers out there to give Hella any more of my business.Update: The only 80/100W 9004 bulbs not backordered are from Hella. So, I purchased their Xenon bulbs from another source. They have not failed in the driveway. Maybe this is a manufacturing issue, seems more like it. Anyway, skip the halogen, get the Xenons."
87447,1,"K&N has long been a favorite of mine, when it came time to change the air filter on my motorcycle, the choice was simple. The product took about 2 minutes to install and while I can't substantiate the HP or fuel mileage increase, I can tell you the acceleration right off the bottom is noticeable immediately. If you switch your filter, this ""lifetime"" replacement is a ""must have""!"
170621,1,"We originally bought this for ""emergency's"" However, we find ourselves using it all the time. We frequently use it as our outdoor radio. While the radio is adequate and simple to operate, don't expect a high quality ""boom box"". I wish that it also had the emergency weather radio built in though.It's a little bit heavy to lug around, but considering that it's basically just a big ol' battery, it's not too bad. It's reasonableThe charge on the system seems to last for a very long time, although I have never measured the actual charge life in hours. Even when the unit was not fully charged, it jump started a bull dozer instantly!. Everyone was impressed. We have also used it to jump start a car. It was super simple to figure out how to jump start the vehicles. (In my opion, it was easier than car to car jumping). Plus, everything that you need comes in the box. However, the jumper cables would be better if they were a bit longerThe item earns 5 stars because it does everything that the manuf said that it would do. :)This is a great all around item to have. Makes a pretty cool gift too :)"

70589,1,I got this for my Suzuki TU250X and it fit great. Just some mild massaging of the exhaust hanger and it sits just perfectly and slipped right on with the exhaust seal from the stock muffler. The sound is nice and smooth and not overly loud. The chrome finish seems pretty decent for it's price point.
135558,0,"Bought these for a used car that I got, they are a little cheaper then I expected but they are great for the price!"
83719,0,These levels work like a charm. Unfortunately the design hasn't changed since I was a boy. They would look right at home on a 70's or 80's trailer but stick out like a sore thumb on my 2011 hard wall trailer.They do the job at a reasonable price. The double sided tape seems to be secure enough. I'm always happy to avoid drilling holes in things that live outside.

160646,0,"This rack is a good, inexpensive solution to the problem of carrying your board without expensive or permanent racks. There are, however, two problems:First,the instructions are illegible, and you'd never figure it out on your own. Fortunately there is a youtube video that can help. Just put ""Block surf Single rack"" in the youtube browser.Second, if you have a 2-door with back windows that don't open (like my Civic Hatchback), you can't get the racks far enough apart for a stable ride at any kind of speed above 25 MPH. However, I solved the problem by running the strap under the hatchback and wedging the strap in next to the hinges. The rear pad will sit right on top of the little spoiler. But be careful to go UNDER the wiring cable. Now I can even carry my 9'6"" noserider at 70+ mph.Watch the video, though,and you'll have an easy time with this.."
132163,0,"The first thing I noticed was it didn't fit on my 09 Honda Civic sedan. The base fit into the harness but once I put it into the entry where the bulb is suppose to go, the orange circle was to wide to fit into the hole. The second problem was the color wasn't really amber but more of a orange-red color. The brightness is good but it will not fit 8th generation Honda Civic sedans. I ended up returning them."
29026,2,"WAY WRONG. Why do people get heating fan motors confused with engine cooling fan motors? It's chronic. Anyway, this will keep you warm and comfy in your car while your engine overheats from no engine cooling fan.....until your engine blows up anyway...then you'll freeze anyway."

29333,2,"Purchased inverter from ""The Inverter Store"" which apparently is AIMS sales division - same address. Original unit died after 4 or 5 uses but just out of warranty. Bought another of the exact same part number to match all the existing wiring and mounting points. New unit was completely different, even the amount of outlets was different; only one on this one. New unit arrived with a screw sticking 1"" out the bottom. Service tech told me to screw it back in. Installed the 'new' one - it did not work at all. So, AIMS no longer carries this unit - it's still in warranty so they are refunding my money BUT NOT THE RETURN SHIPPING. I asked how they could expect customers to pay for returning a product that had manufacturing defects and they said: ""That's our policy.""DO NOT WALK BUT RUN AWAY FROM AIMS INVERTERS. They are absolute junk."
139299,1,"This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away).

They're so good, I've gotten another pair for a different vehicle, same excellent performance. I wish they came in other bulb models/bases, because now that I'm used to having them, the stock ones on my new Corolla S are very weak. The Corolla has a wedge-type base for the back-up lights and I haven't found the halogen back-up bulbs with that type of base yet. Everyone should have a set of these to replace the very-inadequate stock back-up lights. Excellent product!"
175566,2,I've used this product for a few months and it has completely lost its shape. It is now flat and more or less useless. The cushion is very soft and doesn't hold its shape. It's relatively useless now. A little pillow would be just as effective

The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."

My only complaint is that they seem to be about .75 inches shorter than the OEM wipers that were on my vehicle. This is not a huge deal, but it caused me to not give five stars."
184133,2,"We bought a new radiator from amazon.com -- a Spectra Premium CU2307. Installed it, drove around the neighborhood, and everything seemed okay, so I drove it about 30 miles. Then, just as I was parking, a couple ounces of transmission fluid suddenly spilled out. The transmission dipstick was very hot!After leaving it parked for 3 hours we added transmission fluid back to the appropriate dipstick level before driving it again. At first it slipped badly in reverse but worked okay in all forward gears. After 2 or 3 more attempts reverse no longer worked at all, and it slipped in all gears.We discovered that the new Spectra Premium radiator's transmission cooler passage was obstructed so that no transmission fluid was getting to the cooler. The pressure had forced the override vent normally intended to open only in freezing weather. Amazon sent us another radiator whose passage isn't blocked. But now my transmission needs to be rebuilt -- a $3,600.00 job!The response from Amazon customer service was disappointing. They sent me a free replacement radiator, but refused to consider compensating me for any part of the $3,600 damage caused by their defective product! ;-("
129929,0,"Owning 2 mercedes, it is a pain to drain normally. Using the MityVac, you insert the hose, pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil. My only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid. The resulting leak requires additional pumping to create more vacuum. Still, it is definitely easier than lifting the car and crawling underneath to drain it.I also tried on my truck engine and differential and found it easy to use. It was a real time saver on the differential since I did not have to break the gasket for the cover.Update - had for several years now and the seal at the top is leaking. Reduces the suction but still works. Just takes longer.Update - had it for6 years now. Tried to use it yesterday and the mityvac imploded while pumping. Scare me to death. It seems that the plastic did not hold and cracked in multiple places. So now I'm half way through but No way to finish. Had to put new oil in just so I can drive the car. Didn't want to use the old oil fearing plastic bits may have falling into the old oil.Overall , I rate the product as 3 stars. It does what it says and saved me lots of money in oil changes. However, the canister should never implode like that. I don't know if this is a material isseue or inability to deal with oil over the long term. My unit is always stored in the garage. Also since the unit leaked air at the seal from the top (see previous update), it should have never caused it.I'll probably but another one only because I dd not see anything better out there."
133683,1,"This windshield wiper arm puller is super simple and just does the job. I used this to pull off an old rear window wiper arm from my Buick Rendezvous. Granted the stud is only 1/2 inch, so it isn't that massive front window arm, but the arm popped off way easier than I ever imagined.The tool is good metal, it appears to be solid construction for what I'd expect at $12 - it isn't Snap On or Facom, but it does the job. If the plastic knob ever broke off, it would incredibly easy to unscrew the center bolt, add another nut to the top of the bolt, and use a wrench to turn the nut. That's about a 2 minute fix, OK, maybe 10 minutes including time at the hardware store. But the puller is totally usable even if the handle were to break.I had no problem with the plastic handle. It appeared to be reasonably solid. The end of the bolt has a nice rounded face to keep the bolt centered on the wiper arm post.It took maybe a minute to figure out how to turn the base around to grab the wiper arm.Overall, I like the idea of using this as opposed to pry bars or other things with the risk of cracking the windshield. This is a good reasonably priced tool."
57789,2,This dash mat does not fit our dash. Some of the cut outs are correct but many are just a little off. This item will be returned.
158735,0,"I just finished installing this cover on 09 Accord using cross-stitch method described in the instruction paper. It took 2 days (approximately 5 hrs) mainly because my fingers were hurting. I don't recommend this product if you are impatient/don't have time to kill and do not wish to have sore fingers. If you are still planning to get it, here are some tips from personal experience: 1. Take something like the needles but with a nice grip and make all the holes little bigger before installation. 2. Don't just pull the leather to fit the circumference; you also need to make sure the leather is evenly stretched around the diameter. If you don't do it correctly, you will notice of the leather is nicely stretched and the remaining looks a little saggy. 3. Place a piece of cloth but prefer pillow on your lap to hold the needles. Also to protect your legs. 4. Adjust to comfort position by spinning the wheel. 5. Have some entrainment in the background (laptop, cell phone, music, etc.). Yes, you will be sitting there for a while.So yeah, came with a box with the steering wheel cover, 2 needles and 2 long thread. I was able to install it using just 1 thread and still have about 5 inches left on both end (cross-stitch). No broken needles. No sign of ripping on the leather either, even when I pulled it really hard. It only made the holes slightly bigger.I give it 3 stars because 1. Amazon lied about the size. It's for 14 - 15 1/2 diameter and 3 5/8 - 3 7/8. And no, it does not fit the 09 Accord wheel, and yes, I heated it before I installed it. 2. Amazon shipped an used one because there are premature stitch holes that are out of place. Well, too late to return it. 3. Leather quality is not ""super."" Overall, I still give it a 3 because it looks ok, definitely will look better if it were stitched on a car with smaller wheels. PS: It comes in size A, B and C."
100328,0,It's been over a year's experience that I have had with this product. This is the first time I tried it. I see no difference in the length of time it lasts on my car and truck vs other good quality waxes. I'll use the rest of the container on my truck and car again but will not buy more product. The traditional waxes costs less. I gave a 3 star for average but will not buy again
7480,2,"The Color Morphics is as pretty nice system as far as installation and be able to change the color to whatever you'd want. It has a lot of pattens that flash slow and fast as it cycles through out all the colors. I have mine placed inside my vehicle over the gas and brake peddle and under my front seats. Its neat to watch for a few minutes and then gets really annoying if you're trying to drive. I got this mainly because it was advertised for its ability to dance with the music and on the Computer Unit of this device, all the wires fit right into place and there was a little light that would light up where I plugged in the RCA cord to get it to dance in sync with my music and whenever there was a low bass part of any song, that little light would light up to show how the other lights would respond. Unfortunately all the other lights don't dance in sync with my music, they just flash a fast paced pattern of all the colors whether my music is playing or not. Also whenever I have the system on and I dont have music playing, the device feeds back into my amps and causes them to play this weird computer noise??? Don't know why but I'm still having hope that maybe I got a broken computer unit and it can be replaced and solve all my problems, if not then even on sale price this system is way over priced."

179194,1,"Heat over time will eventually kill your v-twin and v-twin oil has to perform triple duty. 1.Lube 2.Cool 3.Clutch. Mobil1 does all three better and extends the life of your bike's engine over dinosaur oil. I use it in my roadliner in florida and it keeps cool even in the hottest weather. I have also been using Mobil1 in my cars for 30 years and after 200,000 miles, none has burned a drop of oil. The only problem with Mobil1 is that it's super slippery and when your engine's gasgets get old and brittle after 10 years, mobil1 will leak out easier than dino oil. That's when it's time to switch to dino oil to prevent drips on your garage floor. Your local motorcycle shop sometimes has it on sale at 8 bucks a quart just to get you in the store so stay on their mailing list and buy enough for 2 oil changes at that price."
70409,2,"I looked for a non-toxic cleaner. I bought Simple Green. Then i found out - Simple Green uses SLS.-----CORRECTION / EDIT: While some Simple Green products do contain SLS, I have discovered that the All Purpose Cleaner does NOT. Those wanting to confirm this for themselves can find the data sheet here:[...]----SLS is a xenoestrogen and I already have fibroids and estrogen dominance. SLS is Not safe, and they use it anyway.Worse, the excuse they use for it is insulting. Is SLS carcinogenic? No, they say. But xenoestrogen exposure is a factor in estrogen dominance, and estrogen dominance HAS been linked to fibroids, cervical cancer, breast cancer, adrenal exhaustion, adrenal fatigue and related subsequent issues such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism leading to insulin resistance and then diabetes, and more.I specifically researched and spent money for a ""green, non toxic"" cleaner, only to discover they use this known toxin.You're better off cleaning with vinegar and baking soda!"

141359,0,"I recently ordered this to replace a broken driver's (left) side light on a 2004 Shoreland'r trailer. The light arrived and I found that while it is marked as being ""Left-Driver Side"", it is actually the light for the passenger's or right side. Whether it is incorrectly marked or Shoreland'r puts their mounting brackets on the opposite way, this was not the driver's side light on my trailer. This light has the curve on the left side, which makes it fit the right side of trailer. You can't go by the pictures of the two products on the webpage since both lights show the curved side on the left. So if you have a Shoreland'r trailer, make sure you check to see if the curve on your bracket is on the right (driver's or left side) or left (passenger's or right side). It could save you having a spare light laying around the house."

After put into this, that two side edge holes are not able totally tightened together. The manufacture should provide two extra steel pad. I do not know about other truck with this situation.3. The slope of connecting tow loop are not exact the same. This causes the bolt are not fully tightened on steel pad provided from this item.The consequence of not fitting are not able to expect full pull strength. I think push strength should be ok. Any way, it has been installed. If you expect to use it for big load, you should choose something else. For bike mount, it is more than enough."

6977,0,"I bought this as supposedly the latest and greatest in spark plug to replace a J19LM/RJ19LM Champion plug for my mower. I should've been concerned when it purported to replace a list of about 10 plugs compared to the specific fit of my previous plug. Anyhow, the connector at the top of the plug is visibly too short compared to a Champion J19LM/RJ19LM. I tried it out anyhow, but the plug cable kept falling off and no amount of messing with the cable would make it fit - the connector is just too short to grip properly. Returned it and replaced it with a proper fit, USA made Champion plug (this E3.10 one is made in China)."
184032,0,I bought this in hope to be able to clean/polish my alloy wheels fast. I have some high end OZ wheels with 17 spokes (!). It takes me usually 20min just to clean the wheels. The product is a fantastic polisher but not a cleaner. Using a soft brush and elbow grease it will probably yeald better results. The Mini Powerball started to shred after first use. Maybe its me that I dont know how to use the product. I have not tried the PowerBall being afraid that the results would be disappointing. The power Metal polish works great just with a rag and a buffing mitt. I am now looking at Mothers' web site or experts to get idea on how to properly use the tool to get the best effect. 3 Stars its all I can give due to the extra work I had to do which would be cut in half by using a brush instead.

158223,0,"First, my perspective: I'm a full-time RV traveler, and purchased this item for basic electrical power while dry camping with no electrical connections. Based on the price, as well as reviews from this site, I expected to be able to operate my small 19"" LCD tv & DVD player, as well as charge my small items such as computer, camera batteries, and handheld vacuum. When I recieved the item, I attempted to charge it for the suggested 15 hours. After 2 hours however, the charger turned off, with a green light indicating the battery was full. When I went to use it a few days later, it was dead. (AGM batteries should not lose charge that quickly, with only a 2% rate of discharge.) The next time we stopped, we plugged the charger into an outlet, and left the unit charging for 24 hours, and it again read fully charged. We watched a two hour movie using only a dvd player, 19"" LCD tv, and a set of computer speakers... (I made sure to turn everything else off, and switch the fridge and water heater to propane.) and by the end of the movie the battery was fully discharged. Based on my experience, I would only purchase this item for emergency lighting, or other low-powered uses. I can't imagine a powertool, or other high-powered device lasting long enough to justify the high cost of this item. I'll keep it for recharging batteries, and powering my phone while off-grid."

175177,1,"I purchased this pump head to repair the Shurflo water pump on my newly aquired RV which had been setting in a garage and unused for about 6-7 years. The pump motor ran but would not pump any water. The repair kit was very simple and easy to install. Instantly,upon re-connecting the pump and turning it on, the unit began to pump water & shut off as soon as full pressure was reached. The pump had been used very little before but I think setting so long deteriorated the check valves inside. The new kit fixed it perfectly."
70315,2,"I purchased an MV50 Portable Air Compressor on 13 July 2011. I have only used the unit a couple of times and it worked OK on my truck tires. While pumping up a bicycle tire, however, after allowing the proper, stated, cool down period, the unit quit on me. I checked the in-line fuse, after retreiving the green 30 amp fuse that came with the unit (I have never before opened the fuse holder or changed the fuse in the unit), and found that the plastic part of the in-line fuse was melted in the holder. I managed to extract half of the fuse but one of the metal arms was welded into place and broke off so that the holder and, therefore, the compressor was unusable. The melted plastic part of the fuse was red, which means that it was a 10 amp fuse, the instructions said it needed a 30 amp fuse and the unit was therefore sent to me with an incorrect fuse installed in it and explains why it was melted. I bypassd the holder (using the 30 amp fuse in the new line I made) and the unit was still dead. Since the unit was still under warranty, I called the Superflow number in the owners manual and was told by a computer to send an e-mail to Customerservice@qindustries and was then hung up on. There is no other phone number provided. I did this and explained the problem and asked for a return authorization number. I got no response after four days so I sent another e-mail with the request and it is now 18 days later and still no response. I've given up on Q Industries equipment and bought another companies compressor.Don't waste your money!"

After deciding where and how I wanted to mount them, it took me longer to design and build a mounting bracket than it did to install and wire these lights. (Mounted lights without drilling any holes in the bumper) I found the instructions very straight forward and complete. For their size they put a great amount of light and clearly light up the night. The light output is very close to HID type lighting, and make the OEM headlights appear yellow.

31536,1,"If you are like me and you bought your car used VW without floor mats then you may be familiar with the frustration of trying to replace them. No longer available from the dealer, the oem mats are only available used at a price way higher than these. After trying several different generic fit and cut to fit mats I still could not get mats that fit properly. The contours needed are to aggressive and I could not trim enough to keep the mats flat on the ground. The other issue I personally had was all of the other mats were too long and I no longer had the clearance for the clutch pedal. Sounds strange but it's true. I wore a hole through one mat in a matter of weeks due to this. These mats are cut perfectly, In my car they match the contours just right, finally the mats can sit flush on the floor. They also stop right before the clutch pedal so my aforementioned issue is now a distant memory. Not only do they avoid the problems of the generic mats but they also cover more area of the floor which is great. You can't go wrong with these mats. The material isn't all that great but it's still better than the auto part store mats. I can only imagine the higher end options offered are far superior in feel and quality. But these get the job done for a fair price , I am pleased with these."

However, when the newly installed wipers sweeped up the screen in a SNOWY weather yesterday, there were annoying squeaky noises all the way while I was driving. It snowed not that much. I guess the problem might be that the blade is not suitable for some cold temperature range like yesterday's 15F.

138026,0,"Ok, I'll be honest... Typically I am NOT all about Coining made in china items as junk. But, I will admit that when I ordered this pump for my 94 bronco to replace my 19 year old original water pump I was shocked to open up my new motorcraft pump to see a sticker on it saying made in china.. Furthermore, when compared to my original pump stamped with 94 on it I realized that the original quality is not there.. This pump is lighter and feels more like a tin can compared to the original pump. Granted, it is working as a replacement and it is going on an almost two decade old truck with 178,000 miles but I am starting to think that if this truck lives long enough that this pump will not last nearly as long as the one being replaced. Honestly, I think I might keep the original as I believe it was just the paper gasket that failed in a section. Just incase.Buyer tip: It comes with the gasket but the original bolts will need to be reused. I recommend having some new replacement bolts on had as theres a good chance your going to break one or two (assuming they have been on the truck long enough). Soak them down in PB for a few days if possible before attempting to remove them. If they do get break be prepared to remove the harmonic balancer, crankshaft pulley and timing cover to get them out. Not a huge deal all in all a few extra bolts but still would be nice to avoid it. I had to do all of the above and heat the seized studs with a map propane torch several times and vice them off. Turned a few hour job into a job that took a couple days between chasing down parts and extra tools.Summary: for the 70.00 price range I thought I couldn't go wrong. Ford direct wants an easy 55.00 more for the same part number pump. Don't know if there's is made in china as well now or what but if I knew it ahead of time I would have stuck with the pump I had originally intended on purchasing at advance auto for 35.00 cheaper."

2167,1,"We previously had a ""shock absorber"" type tailgate damper. It was fine until it broke 3 months after purchase. We bought this and like it better because it also assists in lifting the heavy tailgate of the pickup. Installation was not difficult (our son did it easily) and it works great."
16002,1,"Nice battery. Tossed it in my Cessna 172 to move it around on the ramp, and it turned her over quicker than she ever did with a wet battery. Went down to run it up about 3 weeks later, and it's still topped up. Highly recommend."
106938,1,Having broken two Rallye 4000 lights off road I decided to invest in some cheap protection. So far these have stood up to 4000 miles of on and off road driving and are still clear and bright. They do allow dust and mud to be trapped between them and the light and this needs to be cleaned immediately to prevent excessive scratching.

115211,1,this is portable and user friendly. I bought the washing brush attachment as well. I cleaned my carburetor with this. Use a 50/50 mix of Krud kutter and water or other water soluble cleaners. Not for use with solvent type cleaners Simple green and water works well too!
118295,1,"Seems that Amazon doesn't want to sell this item because they don't tell the most important thing about it, that is that it's a 0 - 60 psi gauge to be used for tires needing about 30 psi, give or take 10. The illustration is incorrect, but they show the same picture for all the different Moroso gauges. I measured accuracy against a digital and it's within .5 psi. Best thing is that it makes a perfect and instant seal with the tire. Put a little extra air in, press the button and it's an accurate fill. Seems like a very high quality product. I think the rubber cover is a must. Amazon's is the best price."
116501,1,"This is a great helmet. I have had mine for almost 2 years now with no complaints. I really like that it has slots for glasses. Most helmets do not take that into consideration and Shoei did. I live in West Texas and was worried that it would be too hot in the summer, boy was I wrong. It moves the air quite well. It might be heavier than some other modular helmets, however the quality is there. It is a little noisier than a full face helmet. That is a trade off I was willing to make. You can't go wrong with this helmet."

When I don't use the holder, meaning I hold the EZ-Pass up to the windshield, the Pass works fine. When I put it into the holder, I have a 50/50 shot of it working. So I've decided to use the adhesive strips and be done with it."
167005,0,"This product is ok. Not enough power is the only complaint. The fan is not loud at all, actually when I was using it, it never came on.

28082,1,"The product seems to be great. It was a little tough to install though, but not too bad. I installed one side, but didn't tighten it down all the way, but when I moved to the other side, it wasn't fitting. After a struggle, I decided to install the second side first. This time, it worked just fine. Hooked up my cargo carrier and was on my way. Nice product. I do have to say though, the shipping package was pretty sad. It came in a box with nothing to keep the receiver from shifting around inside it. The corners of the box were torn up, but the product itself was not damaged. A little padding or packing material would have been good."

187697,1,"I have just recently bought this air filter and man i cant tell you how great it is. First of all it great build and made to last. When i installed this filter in my 2011 Camry SE, i felt the difference right away, the throttle response increased and made my car quicker. I would highly recommend this filter to a friend."
167896,1,I used this with my eDead that I purchased from Amazon also. It helps you get into those corners and crevises that you normally couldn't get too. You don't have to buy it but it makes the install much easier & smoother. You can use the handle end as well to get in those corners that the roller can't get too.
96085,1,Better than the O E M lever for sure. Seems to be working well. Feel like it will hold up much better.

3990,1,I had cut of the Ford Plug to install this on my Sport Trac. I wired it to the wire harness after cutting the bulb fixtures off. It is not bright at any angle other than directly behind it. Also the cargo lights are 5 times brighter than the stop red.It looks great and I do like it no matter what.
70401,1,"I bought this to use on a stainless steel outside grill. I've been using it in cold weather, when the metal's cold, and it takes away all traces of grease, handprint, and other residue with one good wipe. I've been pleasantly surprised at its strength and ease of use."
143365,1,Got these for my 93 Camry and they fit perfect and look great! We used fasteners to hold them in for added support because I have had hubcaps in the past and they tend to fall off sometimes...no matter how good they are.
99935,0,"So I didn't give a 0 star review, but I will say that these plugs do not fit into a 2009 Dodge Charger with a 3.5L V6. The plugs are 1/4 inch short on each side of the nut (1/2"" total) which will not allow them to mate properly in the coil or have the correct spark location.I'm not saying they're bad plugs, because they're probably great in the right vehicle, I just wanted to warn people that there's an error in which car these go to. If you go to Bosch's website, they do not show this plug for this car."
38767,1,These In-channel window visors really give the vehicle a sleek look. Replaced outside mount ones with this set. The back visors go in no problem as they do have a very thin piece of clear tape to hold them in place because they are not held in by tension like the front windows. Use extreme caution with the front windows because you have to bend and twist these to get them into place. I actually broke one due to it was slightly larger on it's size versus truck spec. The reason I say that is I had to buy another front only set and that replacment unit went in with no problem. Best to warm them in the sun as some have suggested to make them pliable. Suggest if you have not put any on your vehicle yet go with the in-channel upfront. To remove old outside mount visors becomes a real chore and you can damage your vehicles paint trying to get the old tape off. They Look Great!
146510,2,I bought this item to keep things from rattling around in the back of my F350. The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place. I would recommend trying a different cargo bar.

63310,0,"This is a awesome idea in my opinion but the cart got a head of the horse.. There is something I'm seeing with these reviews and my own in regards to it saying 100% charged, then immediately dropping to 60% or so when you turn it on. I have solar panels at home that charge deep cell batteries which I use to charge battery banks, phones, my laptop, etc, and this is good to do for building off of that.JUST DON'T EXPECT TO SIT THIS OUT FOR A DAY AND HAVE IT CHARGE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO 50% AND IT LOOSES CHARGE IF NOT USED RIGHT AWAY....HOWEVER, a plus to this is that you can charge it via 12 volt plug like in your CAR (cigarette lighter) which is great for the business man/woman on the move a lot.."
90203,0,"Works great when installed in a cool environment. I operated a microwave oven in my Volvo tractor. It was install in the compartment below the bunk, so it would get warm in the summer months and I would have to lift the bunk to let cold air from the A/C cool it so I could use the microwave. Install it in a cool place and you will not have a problem from this inverter."
28324,0,"I have to admit that it's hard to order a windshield screen sight unseen, even though I had relatively good assurance the size would work. Unfortunately, it wasn't obvious to me that the screen didn't include a cut-out at the top, so the window-mounted mirror became an issue. Fortunately, I can use the shield over the mirror, as the sunshades still hold it up OK. This is a good product, it just wasn't a perfect fit in my case."
98301,1,"This is built well, and hooks right into any standard air compressor's threaded fitting adaptor (not the snap fitting.) As with any screw fitting, you want to use a little gasket tape to prevent leaks where the tool attaches.The gauge reads the line pressure when you're filling the tire, and when you release the trigger, it reads the tire pressure. So filling the tire is a matter of pulling the trigger a bit, then looking, repeat. Couldn't be much easier. The gauge appears to be very repeatable, the needle resting without jitter or wiggle at the current reading in either trigger position.There's also a convenient bleed button that lets you easily drop the pressure in the tire if it's too high.The tool itself is metal and feels substantial in the hand.I used it with a source of 60 psi, to fill tires to 30 psi; everything went perfectly smoothly.I would have liked it if the hose were longer, so that the fill could be done without bending over, but this is really a minor point and I wouldn't take credit off for it. Terrific addition to any tire-filling toolset."

126251,0,"We choose to order this Spark Plug Gapper over other ones specifically because it said it was made in USA. I opened the box today to find on the back of the package the words ""Made in China.""

170683,1,"Put this on a 1979 Mercruiser 140, along with a new aftermarket exhaust manifold. Great combination! No leaks and runs at the perfect recommended 140 degrees. Easy install.

62331,1,"We just ordered two of these coin holders and are very pleased with them. They hold plenty of coins and we have had no trouble getting the coins in and out. I love mine for when I am traveling, keeps all the coins organized and is so easy to use. It sure beats digging to the bottom of the old pocket-book. Great quality product, I have seen cheaper ones in the stores, but this one is made of heavier plastic and seems much easier to use."
28680,0,"My $.03.. Fairly easy install. I had to pry open the accessory panel because it was rhino linered. Electrical cable was a tad short and I had to extend it to the passenger side. When it was installed and locked there was some play in the lock before it would catch and the gate would still open. So I had to adjust the handle to not open instantly. Hard to explain but I basically had to adjust the handle so it wouldn't engage right away (about a 1/2 - 3/4 pull on the handle before it engaged). So I added handle play. This would allow the handle to not engage before the lock engages (contact to the scissor part). But if you pull really hard, the lock would slip off the scissor part and open the gate. I had to bend the scissor part a bit up to help stop that. I could probably pull really hard and have it slip again but I didn't. So like I said decent deterrent only. If someone really wanted in they would just bash the window in on my topper. Different if you just had a lid though. BTW: the picture is not right for this product. This is just the internal lock and your stock handle stays. The picture looks like a cover with a key hole. Do your research and know what you're getting first."
145323,2,I bought this to replace stock lights on my mazda mpv which were getting weaker. This one produced a somewhat whiter light but not any brighter than my 6 year old stock headlights. So it didn't serve my purpose and but at this price not too much of a loss.
89266,1,Only cost 3 times as much as a typical filter. But can clean and reuse over and over. Only have to by a recharge kit and clean each time you change the oil.
68672,1,great item . makes hooking up the charger very easy .Hanging the cord from the ceiling with a retractable cord to replace lead works excellent .

I clean the car regularly, and have used Simple Green for years to remove brake dust, and for a multitude of other cleaning jobs. P21s was about as effective as Simple Green, but costs many times more, and is just as environmentally safe from what I can tell. I can't see spending about 10 times the money, ounce for ounce, for a cleaner that is no better than a readily available general cleaner that does the same job. P21s is very good, to be sure, but for my money, I'm sticking with Simple Green.simple green All-Purpose Industrial Cleaner/Degreaser"
183054,1,"I bought this because my steel cable broke while plowing the furthest end of my driveway, and it was a pain to drag the plow back to the garage.

Easy to install on quad, and hopefully it lasts me a couple more seasons."

I noticed an immediate difference from take off and the trucks ability to pull from mid-range to high RPMs. I have a magnaflow exhaust system and lets just say the combination has made my F150 wake up from the dull and boring.

173143,1,"To the guy who rated it 1 star, you dislike it because you are using it wrong. EVERY car enthusiast I have spoken to on the topic says you dont need to let it haze rather just wipe it off immediately, I agree. Then you dont have to worry about the glue condition etc...If you REALLY want a great looking car here is an excellent recipe:1. Hand wash the car well2. Clar bar the whole car3. Make sure that sucker is as clean as possible with Quick Detailer perhaps4. Use the All-in-One Klasse on the whole car5. Use the High Gloss Sealant on the whole car (3x for perfection but you must wait 24hrs in between coats to avoid hazing)6. Use S100 Wax as a topper and reapply every month and your Klasse will last 1 yearThis proceedure while intensive will make your paint POP! Trust me I've done it now for the past 3 years and tried other products without finding anything better.-Happy DetailingBeefey"
122668,1,"I installed this on my F-150. It was well packaged and had two sets of adapters for the hitch power. There is a lot of wire that I had to tape up under the truck and attach with plastic ties to keep it from hitting the pavement, but no problem, The connections are solid. The unit seems solid, and does not really stick out.In reverse there is a single beep to let you know it is on. As you approach objects it gives you a yellow warning and intermittent tone, I never really got the slow beep and green light. Then it goes into red and steady tone. The LED lights are hard to see in daylight, but the tone is loud and unmistakeable. So far I like it."

159827,0,"I have many batteries that need maintaining for cars trucks boats, motorcycles and equipment.For years I've been using Battery Tenders. I have probably 10 -15 of them for various 6 volt and 12 volt batteries, however I was a bit frustrated that they hadn't updated the product for probably 20 years, and they didn't seem to work well with the AGM batteries I've been using more and more.A friend told me about the Battery Minders and that they were supposed to desulphate as well as maintain charge in the batteries. That sounded like a great thing.I bought one of these larger ones and one of the smaller ones a year or two ago.Both of them charge batteries fine and seem to maintain the charge on them fine.However I've been disappointed with the claim that these will desulphate the batteries and make them work better. I've placed this larger Battery Minder and the smaller one on batteries that were maybe verging on weakness and have not been able to recover any performance from the batteries.One was a small AGM battery out of a motorcycle. I had the battery minder on the battery for probably 3 months. Every few weeks I would run a test on the battery with my battery load tester - I found no change to the battery capacity over that time.A second was a larger wet cell battery out of a Sea Doo. Same story - I left the battery minder on the battery for probably 4-5 months - no change in battery power - in fact, that one actually got worse.I had this larger one continuously on a large 12 volt forklift battery for probably 5 months - the battery remained weak.This particular charger will charge at 2,4 and 8 amps and has a setting for wet cell as well as AGM batteries - It's a little frustrating setting it up in that it resets itself to 2 amp charge and AGM setting every time you disconnect it from a battery.So - does it work? Well yes, it seems to be built well and it charges and maintains batteries fine, but I'm not going to expect it to ""recover"" any batteries. I'm sure this will offend the manufacturer, but in real-world use, I don't see any advantage of this Battery Minder over my Battery Tenders that cost half as much and have kept my batteries charged for many years.I'm not going to throw it away, but I had hoped for additional value"
117171,1,Recently bought this from Amazon. Appears to be well made. Easily loosen a lug tightened to 100ft.lb with a torque wrench at 80psi air pressure. I am sure it can do more but my torque wrench is limited to 100. Seems 180ft.lb max torque is true. My only complain is the forward/reverse change needs tremendous effort. I had to hammer it the first time but easier afterwards. This wrench will do well in those tight areas. The torque adjustment knob is built in the air inlet housing and handy.
23124,2,"I am not wild about this item. Maybe my technique is at fault, but...

If clearance is tight, then I would look elsewhere for a set of higher lifting ramps.

40551,0,Wagan Ortho Wedge CushionThis product did not meet my requirements but was a beginning. It did not fit my driver's seat. The cut-out at rear of cushion was not comfortable and there was a gap between back of seat and cushion. The height and foam consistency were o.k. I took it to a custom upholsterer who made a new cushion the same general measurements with a rounded back edge and no semicircular cutout. Set me back $100 but at least I won't have to stare at the setting sun any more.
123775,2,The first strap broke 30min into our trip. It flew off and went under the car behind us-lucky no crash! We had to stop and buy bungee cords to hold it on the rest of the way. We when arrived the bag had multiple tiny tears. Our stuff got wet when it rained. Before we came home we had to tape the whole bag with waterproof tape. Half way home (about 6 hours into trip) people on the highway started honking at us as another strap had broken and the bag was sliding off the bag of our van- suitcases and all. We had to buy a 20$ strap to hold it on. I called customer service to report problem and was told rep was at lunch and would call me back- haven't heard back from them at all.
162703,1,"Purchased this lock set for our motorhome. The existing lock did not have outside key slot for the bolt lock, just the spring handle latch. Installation was easy and the fit was very close. Lock works fine. Quality fine.The problem is that we ordered chrome, not white, per the listing and the picture. However, we were about to leave on a trip so the white one was installed. Fortunately, the door is painted white so the lock looks fine. Any other ""wrong"" color and we would have sent it back. The previous lock was chrome and, we believe, more durable. There are already visible scratches and chips on this one. If you purchase this I would suggest confirming the color by email or telephone."
59089,1,"Came in time promised and in good condition. Colors are bright and distinctive. Not as difficult to put on as it first seemed. Once on it stays in place. Seems like it will be lasting. To be seen if colors fade in the sun, but so far look beautiful."
133416,2,"I was purchasing a CD for my Son. During the process I searched for TR4A's. That's a 1960's Triumph Sports Car. I found a Triumph Magnetic Drain Plug there which I am reviewing now. Although I thought I was receiving a TR4A drain plug (that's what I searched on), and the description indicated ""Triumph"", I purchased it. The drain plug did not fit a Triumph Sports Car, it fit a Triumph Motorcycle. I couldn't use it, nor affort to send it back. I wasn't pleased with the product or how it was portraied."
99656,1,"Here in South Florida, we have what would be described as unpredictable weather... which leads to unpredictable power ;-). Since I work at home on the computer, I need to be able to work through our unexpected power outtages which can last several hours at a time. My UPS just wouldn't cut it for power outtages lasting more than an hour or so.Enter the king of UPS's, the APS 750! I bought a marine battery at Walmart for under $70 and connected it to the unit. Just the one battery gives me about 5 to 6 hours of run-time for both my desktop and my LCD monitor. If I need more run-time, I can simply connect more batteries in parallel.Like a regular UPS, the unit charges when it has power, and switches to battery during a surge or blackout. Though the transfer time is a bit higher than a typical UPS, it doesn't seem to matter."
62135,1,this is good product but is streaky i dont know if because need to wash it with the soap they have or abosorbtion or its the material some things it works really good on
33562,1,We recently purchased the Lund Cargo carrier and carrier side bar attachment. They were a great combination. Smaller than a trailer but big enough to carry all our camping stuff that would not fit in the car. To complement the two items a cargo net really helps.
102192,0,"This cargo carrier must be used with a four rail luggage rack on your car. My car only has 2 side rails so the carrier slide backwords the whole trip. It is very difficult to get things in and out while you are travelling, if you need to access items daily on a journey its a struggle.Some water does get in. There is no lock so it can be cut easily and broken into. A hard top carrier with a lock is much safer."
146739,0,Bought as gift for someone. Overall not a bad product & does what it says it does. Gave it three stars because there is too much plastic in the design.
128055,2,"Main sticking point: the product description says, ""Comes with access to innova.com RepairSolutions which gives trouble code definitions, a full diagnostic report, probable causes, most likely fixes, and more.""The problem is that you have to pay for the report. You don't even get a free ""generic"" report. The supposed ""software"" that comes installed sends you to INNOVA's web site where after a long and convoluted registration process--your private info, your car and VIN info--you get bumped to a page where you have the opportunity to spend even more money for a report of the problem."
137372,1,I have been using this product for a few years and it is great. The shine last almost two weeks. It make your car look brand new!
61420,0,I purchased this product and when it arrived it had no instructions..... Okay I am pretty handy at putting things togeter so I get started using nothing but the picture on the box to assemble the unit. After a couple attempts to put it together I discover that the unit is missing the holes in the handle to attach the stand. Luckily I have the tools and skill necessary to make this thing work but if I had been mechanically challenged this thing would have been in the trash or back to the seller!
121609,1,Product was exactly what I ordered and worked perfectly. Installation was simple and required very few tools and very little time
23769,1,"just as nice as any on the market at a better price, charges up small tv takes time but works well"
62991,1,I was shocked to get a replacement taillight assembly for under $15 with free Prime delivery. It fit perfect and now makes the other side look not so nice!
91259,1,My Dad can no longer find this product in stores. It has been discontinued. He loves it. He always keeps his car looking like it just rolled out of the showroom.
137688,2,"Seems like a decent quality cover for the price. However, I rate two stars because Nelson-Rigg and Amazon are so unhelpful about selecting the correct size. Even the Nelson-Rigg web site is so unhelpful, lacking ANY dimension information, that I have to think was intend to mislead you in order to sell a second cover that is large enough. As someone else noted, if you get a cover that is too small, you can send it back for exchange, but only if the package hasn't been opened. That means, you can't really send it back because unless you open the package, and you can't know if it is the right size until you open the package.I did my best, and ended up with one cover that is way too small, and one cover that is barely large enough. I ended up ordering one more cover of XXL size for my Harley Sportster, and it fits pretty well, but that isn't the largest bike made. The XL cover that I originally ordered for the Sportster, I now use on my wife's Honda PCX 125 scooter, and it isn't overly large. The Medium size cover that I originally ordered for the scooter is worthlessly small.My suggestion is to go to a local dealer that will let you test fit a cover. If you want to mail order a cover, select what you think is the correct size, and then order two sizes larger. Unless you are worried that strong winds might tear an over-large cover, it is far better to have a too-large cover than a too-small cover. A too-small cover stresses seams constantly, and makes for difficult install and remove with every use."
32065,2,I bought this item about 14 months ago.I am constantly in remote areas in the winter so I thought this would be a good idea.Well I was wrong I used it twice to put some air in my tires and it now doesn't charge on either mode of charging.I am glad I did not depend on this piece of crap to help me in the winter or I would still be stuck.I would never buy an item made by this so called tech company again.I wish I could give no stars.
94228,2,I ordered one of these for my subaru- didn't even come CLOSE to fitting properly. It's the usual cheap automotive grade carpet as well. Avoid and get something you can see in person and make sure fits.
162023,0,Easy fitting with the brackets from my old Memphis fats screen. Less buffetting than the latter but more wind noise.
140606,2,"I purchased this from the Gold Box offer and just got it today and there's a tag on the cord that says:WARNING: Handling the cord onthis product will expose you to lead,a chemical known to the State ofCalifornia to cause cancer, and birthdefects or other reproductive harm.Wash hands after handling.I guess as long as you don't let your kid chew on the cord, there's no problem if the cord contains lead, but just another reason why the US needs to have stricter imports from China for products that do contain lead."

52823,1,"convivial good, all you have to install it with the car off when you turn it on whenever the engine is automatically turned on but then you can turn on and off."
176491,2,"Purchased a mechanical water temp gauge about a year before I found an alternate use for it. During the installation process I discovered that there was no sensor nut on the capillary tube. Apparently the nut was not installed during gauge assembly. This tube is filled with ether gas and is pressurized and sealed. In order to install this piece, the tube must be disassembled from the gauge. Needless to say there is no way of installing the nut without breaking the seal and loosing the gas. I wrote to the their customer support about this situation and have yet to receive a response. I am now going to toss the gauge into the trash and buy another from one of their competitors. Can not be any worse regarding their quality control and lack of customer service."
156339,2,"For some reason I thought this product was a made with natural based ingredients, which it is not. There is alot of chemicals in the ingredients and it is not biodegradeable. If you are not concerned about this I'm sure it's a fine product. The way it was packaged also made the lid pop open during shipping and the wipes were dryed out. I called the company and they sent me a new one no problem, great customer service."
152924,1,"I like this wind shield. It is just large enough to take the majority of the wind-blast off of your chest increasing ride endurance. It does not affect your temperature at all like a larger shield so it's not for those looking to keep warmer. It also will not help against bugs.I do recommend this windshield, provided people understand that it's not a full height windshield."
46112,2,product was supposed to have a timing tab..i paid 22 dollars for an eighteen dollar item even after contacting customer service..........i'm disappointed but not to where i'll never order again...i've ordered several items since and they were right
77862,1,I bought these right before the recent snow storms in Colorado. They have worked great on my Acura MDX with no problems at all! Better than the comparable Rain-X wipers that I bought last winter season.
82817,1,"In Germany rare-to-find spare part. Good quality, fits perfect to 40-year-old Buick. Easy to install. Because of the adjustable diaphragm it can easily be adjusted to individual needs. Works very well. But be careful when turning the adjusting mechanism, it seems to be quite fragile."
44727,1,I havent tried this product so I dont excatly know how to review it but it looks good though
110076,0,This socket uses a ratchet that turns the outside of the socket. If you don't have the special wrench don't buy this socket because the inside is just a hole.
8924,2,"I bought this generator (Same model and specs, but different paint and details from the picture of what is now sold) way back in January 2008, unpacked it, made a quick test that it worked, drained the fuel and oil and otherwise prepared it as per the manual, and put it in storage. When I pulled it out last week after a wind storm, it started and ran for eight hours straight...great! The next day, it would only run two-to-ten minutes, then quit. On inspection I found corrosion in the fuel tank. I cleaned that up, and also the fuel valve, plug and carburetor, but it still ran only a few minutes at a time.Looking closer, I also found damaged parts: The spark plug ceramic; the spark plug cap; the plastic panel behind the control panel; the plastic box that holds the air filter and mounts to the carb. Other metal parts were bent here and there, including the fuel valve assembly, idle adjust bracket, and choke and regulator linkages.Though pieces were broken off and missing, there were no loose parts rattling around in the shipping materials when received, and I certainly did not cause the damage. There is also evidence of touch-up painting. My conclusion is that this item either was not new when I bought it, or was damaged in the factory, and then quickly ""cleaned-up"" and repacked. I cannot accuse Amazon or the shipping provider of the damage, as the carton and packing was fine when I received it.My conclusion is that there is (or at least was) poor quality control and little sense of responsibility to the customers in this company's products! I tried by email and phone to talk to them, but neither call nor email has been returned. I take responsibility for not seeing the damage the day I unpacked it, but I write this as a warning to anyone considering buying anything made by ETQ. Also, their manual's storage instructions are evidently insufficient, and if and when I get another generator, I will be running and inspecting it regularly to be sure it is ready for an emergency."
83122,2,"This clock was supposed to be 5 x 4 x 1 inch-it's about 2 1/2"" by 1"" by 3/4"". I bought it for my car but it's not large enough!"
127969,2,"I bought this kit thinking the digital tire gauge would be great. I guess it would be great IF I could actually read it when it was on the tire. I can never seem to position it so I can see the readout. The pliers and flashlight are useful, but I already had those. The bottom line is that I am disappointed with this purchase."
57515,2,"I have a Toyota Corolla 2010. Then, I have this little vacuum that did not work at all. You can't say that there's something wrong with the car or its car lighter. My car is newly purchased and the car lighter is 12 volt.The vacuum was a defective product.For potential consumers, purchase it on your own risk. It's $20 anyway.If it's okay for you to spend casually, buy me one too.But, now, I'm just going to get my refund. Peace out. One love."
96581,2,Description suggests that is better than OEM. FALSE. It's crap. I wasted money buying it and even more money getting it installed.
165760,2,"The value is good, but the quality of the bags is horrible! After 2 days of use, the two saddlebags tore and were rendered useless. I would not recommend these saddlebags, unless they are to be used for decoration. So, remember you get what you pay for, in this case a cardboard filled ""leather set""."
159978,1,"These wipers installed quickly, read the directions though. They've been working well. Because of the AZ sun they need to be replaced more frequently."
170746,1,"I bought my Cargo Carrier a few years ago to carry firewood for bonfires with groups of friends. It is amazing how often I use my Cargo Carrier to move around items that I normally wouldn't want in my vehicle, such as; sandy beach furniture, bags of concrete, grills and potentially leaking coolers. The best part about this particular model is the entire cargo carrier folds up and locks into place so that I can still have my cargo carrier with me at all times even if I'm not using it (extends about 6 inches). It makes it extremely useful to be able to leave it on the back of the vehicle when not in use and not having to take it on and off (as many times, you are away from home before you realize you need it). It turns any vehicle with a tow hitch into a 60"" x 20"" bed pickup truck."

45591,2,"I just received a package of this product centric 105.034 posi-Quiet ceramic brake pad with shims... but I am confused, first because I was thinking it was the kit. 2nd. Would I be able to know if this order that I made is for the forward wheels or back wheels? because I need the back ones, in case that they are diferent that I need, would you be able to change it?I really appreciate it. thank you/"
9667,1,"I'll have to let you know how these hold up after a year... but for now, I'm loving these wipers. So smooth, so quiet, hugs tight and doesn't miss a spot. Wow, what a difference from the cheapos that were on my car when I bought it. There's no turning back now, I'll always have to buy top-notch wipers after this! Very easy to install, as well -- and I'm a newbie at this kind of thing (pumping gas was the extent of my mechanical know-how). The Bosch ICON wiper blades are streamlined, too... a nice change from the overly engineered look. I'm thinking my PT Cruiser is feeling pretty sexy tonight."
25465,0,I bought these ties for an exhaust wrap job on my Harley. I can't say I'm impressed by their performance. I used one as a starter strap to hold down my exhaust wrap but when I was done I ended up using a hose clamp to fully secure the wrap in place. These ties are difficult to pull really tight so they spin easily on the wrap material. They look good but don't live up to their looks.
127992,0,"Very nice gauge / tool. Ruggedly built with a nice storage case. But... The back-light feature is nice and needed. It illuminates the screen in dark places, like on your hands and knees beside a car in the garage, and without it, a flashlight is required. Problem is, this is a two hand gauge, so without a miner's hat or very strong teeth, it is impossible to use in lower light. The back-light in mine became intermittent after the second use. By intermittent, I mean it might work 1 in 20 times. The gauge functions were fine though (with the miner's hat) Soon after, I shipped it for repair on my nickel, figuring it would not make a handy paper weight. I haven't heard a peep since. My fingers are crossed."
151306,2,"I purchased this due to my previous experience doing rear brakes taking 4 hours with twisting the piston a quarter turn with channel locks and pushing in with a c-clamp over and over and over again on my 03 Maxima. I was hoping this would make doing my mom's 02 Monte Carlo a breeze. First thing I noticed when I received the package were misspellings on the box and the 2nd was it was made in China. I opened the package up and there was obvious signs of wear on several pieces. The 08 piece for GM products had some sort of oily/greasy feel. I know some factories put rust inhibitors or products to protect pieces but ONLY this one had this oily/greasy feel. The packaging and case are new but it appears that used pieces that are returned/salvaged get recycled into new units from what I can guess. All of this I would probably be alright with if the dang thing came with instructions and worked. There is one piece of paper that says it is the instructions but on the backside of the page is a picture of all the pieces and labels for what manufacturer the discs are used for. On the front side, half of the page is dedicated to safety tips and recommendations. Another quarter is dedicated to listing the parts included. The last quarter lists warranty information. I couldn't figure out how to use this on the piston and rather than wasting daylight I used the C-clamp and old brake pad approach and thankfully it was a breeze. I took this over to my uncle who worked as a maintenance tech, electrical engineer, and is now a software engineer and he couldn't figure it out. I'm just going to return this. I'm not going to waste my time calling their customer service for real instructions since the job I needed this for is complete. I was going to give this 2 stars but I can't come up with a positive thing to say about this. Maybe its a good product if you know exactly how to use it before you purchase it?Oh and if you just vote me as non helpful because you were able to figure out this product and I couldn't that's just low. Comment me and let's debate. If not, then keep being a coward and hiding in your mom's basement. I gave a detailed explanation why I rated the item so low, not every person has the same experience using the same item"
22334,1,"I own four different styles of wheel chocks, two self-locking and another one similar to this. Each have their good and not so good points. I have used this one successfully for two seasons and am happy with the results.The unique features of this chock are the high quality chrome finish, the 99% ""removability"" and ""V"" shaped front. The chrome plating, as well as the tube stock, is seemingly very thick and durable. Although the main chock tube assembly is removable, the two rear cleats remain secured to the floor. That's only a problem if the floor surface is shared for walking such as inside a toy hauler or camper, as it can create a tripping hazard. I countersunk mine into the reinforced floor of the toy hauler, though it was difficult because of the irregular shape of the cleats. Other chock companies use round cleats, so countersinking is more easily accomplished with a ""light touch"" of a hole saw and chisel. The front anchor point for the ""star"" wheel bolt (wingnut-like) is a threaded insert and fits flush with the floor. I found that the ""V"" shape of the tube frame held the front tire more securely than my other chocks with the round ""U-shaped"" tube. My FJR1300 is rather large and top heavy (700 lbs) with dual front rotors, so every advantage is helpful. I purchased this 6-1/2"" version so that it would be secure but not damage the rotors, and it's worked well. Obviously, this is only a good point to start the securing process of a motorcycle. In addition to this chock, I used a combination of ""E"" channels, rubber matting, and suitable tiedown ratchet strapping."
187146,0,"I am relatively happy with the Jeep Garage Park Stop Light. It does the job it says it will do. I am not happy, however that the manufacturer does not offer the AC adaptor as an accessory. I wrote to them and they replied that they did not offer an adaptor. I tried a ""universal"" adaptor, but it did not work. I may have to stop using this device because it can become unreliable if the batteries are low."
95633,1,"This mat is huge, covers the WHOLE rear floor area. You have to flip up the seats to install, but it fits perfectly. A far cry from the skimpy 11 X 6 carpet mat Ford installs in the rear-what a joke! This mat stays put and will pick up whatever your rear seat passengers drag in on their shoes.Amazon had the best price, over $25 cheaper than ordering direct from the Mfg. Keep up these great prices Amazon!"
185983,0,"I must admit that I was a little disappointed when I received my LITE Hammer. They make it look like it's metal - it's not. The hammer handle is plastic with metal pointed tips and an embedded razor blade for cutting belts. The silver version is painted to look like metal, mine had a pretty nasty paint job. Also, the light is very cheap; it has an inconvenient swinging on/off switch that is small and would, I assume, be hard to use in an emergency situation. One last con, they don't give you anything you can use to mount it to your car - they just give you some dumb suggestions (double-sided tape - like that will hold). All in all, I think the product would perform just fine if required, but this is not a high-quality tool by any means."
42140,0,"Do not get this, ""PIAA 95065 Super Silicone Black Wiper Blade - 26"" (driver side wiper) for 2007 Honda CR-V. Although, it installed properly, it will not wipe evenly due to the shape of PIAA's wiper and how it 'touches' the CR-V's windshield surface. The wiper does not have enough 'curve' pressure at the end, to keep it press against the windshield, so it ended up not wiping whole glass area it covers. Some people recommended getting shorter length than 26"" to solve this problem. I have not try that, so I cannot confirm if that will work. The 16in wiper for passenger side, ""PIAA 95040 Super Silicone Black Wiper Blade - 16"", works fine on the 2007 Honda CR-V though.This PIAA wiper is nice, it's just too bad it doesn't work for driver side of Honda CR-V. :("
186263,0,"This product does the job, and fit right in to the car with no modifications or hammer-tweaks required. For the price, you really can't find anything better. This is not a 'performance' item, with its incredibly smashed/crinkled construction, but my mileage is same as usual, about 22.5-23 mpg. When and if this thing finally rusts out, I'll buy another one."

121112,2,"This was a humongous waste of money. I bought it to help keep pipes in the back of a covered bed truck from freezing in Georgia. We had an unusually cold winter and I had to find something that could just keep the pipes from freezing when my drivers were coming from their homes to the shop. These trucks were all covered bed vehicles, parked in garages, and heated all night. This little heater just had to keep the pipes from freezing for a 30 minutes drive and it couldn't even do that. Unbelievably weak little things!!!!I bought a cheap ceramic heater from Home Depot and it did a much better job. BUYER BEWARE!"
8960,0,This did not fit my car as it listed. The power plug was a different size and shape to my car. I could only get one motion - either up and down or left and right.I gave 3 stars because I not sure if it was the mirror or the car which was the problem.

25026,0,"The locking mechanism is steel, but the body is all plastic. I'm not sure how well it will hold up to abuse. I think it would stop someone from stealing the trailer, but even the most minor attack and I'd have to cut the thing off. Easy to use, but just doesn't seem as tough."
66618,2,"I expected a lot more for the price. I figured I would give it a try since I have used Meguiars on my cars and the polishes have always been good. To be blunt, the stuff I eventually made for about $1.25 worked better. The spray bottle was .99 of that. You can easily make better cleaners with household chemicals for far, far less. I'm not going to give a recipe here but it's easy, cheap and works better. I was looking for a silver bullet and we all know that's a myth."
117655,0,"These are heavy duty and look alot better than an outside the window mounted visor, it did take a few days for them to seat properly in my window without it getting caught in my window, you may need some more double sided adhesive tape to prevent this from happening on the backside of the visor."

150427,0,"I really love the idea of the cab. It is much warmer inside and of course dried, but, the view around the close proximity is obstructed, and for snow plowing it is a critical view for the work involved. The headlight is also obstructed and the zippers on the windows do not slide smoothly. They catch sometimes getting stuck. I wonder how long they will work, or last.The top is not tight and therefore holds snow or water, it should have some curve to it and be tighter. Over all,, I think it is over priced. You can buy a really nice tent for under $100.00 with more material, work, and better quality. A good idea that needs some improvements.I must say though, I am keeping it. I would rather have it than nothing:-)"
47817,0,Not the greatest but what can you expect for the price. it does get the job done as a cheap day to day wheel.
122248,1,"This tank is well built and contained all of the parts described though it is very expensive for what it is. Took a while to find it on line and there were no competing product manufactures? For some reason in the RV shopping ""world"" prices are extremely high for all products and supplies. You must deal with the closed dealer network (ie Camping World) to buy almost any accessory. The company who built your RV does not respond to requests for replacement parts. Though most items are produced in Indiana there are no online companies selling any of the products made in the area. This keeps prices high and makes adding accessories or refurbishing your RV next to impossible. With the economy down turn this market has collapsed on itself. If any other product where the price was supplier controlled people would be outraged. Next thing you know the they'll be looking for a Govt. hand out."

125755,2,"I bought 5 cans of this for a project... Horrible!! It's not the paint, it's the sprayer. I sprayed it on the ground to figure out what the heck it was doing and it made two lines... With one spray? Three of the five cans did this. The two that didn't do this had the normal spray top on them. The chalkboard paint by Krylon was perfect and so easy to use. Good product if you get the regular spray button top thing - check before you buy."
112746,1,We have been renting a small UHaul to travel from VA to MS in order to keep space for everyone in the car. We purchased this one before our trip this year and used it instead. It was awesome! Very easy to install and load. Allowed for the back door of the vehicle to still open and for the dog to get in and out of the back easily even with it fully loaded. Reasonably priced and definitely well worth the money!
58666,0,"The pros: It seems to work; that is, it cushions underfoot, as it is supposed to.The cons: It has a rather industrial appearance, and I am not sure that it's 3/8"" thick as described.

My advise is to be aware of the supplier and if you have to return it make sure to get the return shipping pre paid otherwise you may be out extra cash!!!"
70533,2,"This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals.

The plastic cleaner in the Rain X kit isn't as good as Meguiar's but the sealant makes a huge difference. So if you do buy this product, be sure to buy a sealant!"

76020,1,"Well made and was easy to install. I've had the chance to use this plow in many snow falls from several inches deep up to more than 2 feet. This product works well and holds up to hard use very well. Using this plow my ATV will clear my drive way and walks quicker than my diesel tractor with a rear snow blade. The ATV is much more nimble and much quicker in tight quarters and gets the job done in about half the time. Most of our snow comes a few inches at a time. For lesser amounts of snow the Swisher is the first implement I reach for. I don't bother using the big tractor unless we have a very deep wet snow. The Swisher's only limitation is the power of the ATV it's mounted on. My Honda Foreman is a 500 cc power house that handles snow very well with the Swisher Snow Plow. For very deep snow (18"" or more) I have to take it off in 2 or more layers. That is not a problem for a small area of deeper snow caused by drifting. But if Mother Nature dumps a foot and a half or more on us, I fire up the big diesel tractor to do the heavy lifting. If your ATV has the power, this plow is WELL WORTH THE MONEY."

In my opinion the biggest problem with it is that in order to use the tools, you have to open it, exposing the sharp serrated knife blade, and it's small and a bit awkward to hold so you have to be very careful about how you open and use it so you don't slip and slice your hand open. I never give it to someone else to use for fear that they'd hurt themselves with it. I'd much rather use a Leatherman Micra or something, even if it's a little bigger."

I guess I just have a knack for logically figuring things out. When it came to simple things like determining what is causing a Check Engine Light to come on, I got tired of taking my cars to Auto Zone to have the code read.The final straw was when my girlfriend's car had a persistent Check Engine situation that required to have the code continually reset, so I went out and bought this unit. I could have gone with a cheaper unit for resetting the code, but I am glad that I bought a medium-end model like this that can store codes and hook up to a PC. The unit is well built, comes in a nice carrying case, and is easy to use.The screen is backlit which makes it easy to see at night. In the daytime, the screen is just as easy to read with its sharp pixels and several rows of information.So far, I have successfully used this on a Toyota Corlla, Hyundai Sonata and Tucson, a Pontiac Trans Am, a Honda Civic, and a Mazda 3 with no compatibility problems.If you do a lot of routine maintenance, this is a great tool to have, to help troubleshoot problems."

It was very helpful including the installation videos on the net. I noticed that there is a connector in my car where those little wirings seems to converge to. This connector is not connected to any. It must be for the T-harness they call it. I might have installed it easily if I have it. I have a car manual and I can read diagrams so it helped a lot in the installation. The only cons: The LED tester that came with it was defective. It only light up RED on positive hit only! So I used a VOM for the Negatives.Tested it at more than 400ft unobstructed, signal is capable. From inside the building to the parking lot- it didnt. Overall, I AM SATISFIED with this starter."

116376,1,Had to return it simply b/c when you tighten the blocks they are not even. It causes and forces you to keep an eye on the two blocks to make sure they are evenly lined up with each other. Not having the wing nuts makes this one of the better products. One way around the issue is to tighten both nuts slowly and as you get tighter use a vise to keep them aligned otherwise if you flare you will not get a the opening dead center on the tube.

(I wish Amazon would allow vulgar language so that I may accurately describe this piece of... waste product)The cars on T.V. were being shot with lasers and exposed to ocean water. Nothing was damaging the paint; the water kept sliding right off the car and leaving a spot-free mirror finish with no effort. I would be a fool to believe every single thing on T.V., but I certainly did not expect the paint on my car to WEAR DOWN ALL THE WAY TO THE PRIMER even though I repeatedly used this product!!!Save your hard-earned money and buy a real wax.

Two seasons ago I purchased NAPA winter blades and by mid winter the rubber ""housing"" was shifting, ripping and the main wiping part of the blade was getting rough. Last season I installed I believe Bosch winter blades .. again this is what was available locally. I would say they were in the same category as the NAPA. Both of the mentioned blades were not as heavy duty as the Anco winter blades and in the past I've always got about 2 seasons from the Anco blades.. I should also mention the NAPA and Bosch blades cost more than the Anco. ""Make them cheaper and charge more"". I'll stick with Anco."
51561,1,"Found this inexpensive clutch slave as an alternative to purchasing from the ""normal"" parts places for my '74 FJ40 Land Cruiser. I also purchased the matchingBeck Arnley 072-4757 Clutch Master Cylinderso I could replace the whole setup at one time. The installation is as simple as draining the clutch system, replacing the parts, and properly bleeding the setup. Here are the side problems I had with the installation:-I found that the old crush washer, and rubber hydraulic hose were worn, so I replaced those as well with braided steel instead of rubber. Went to a local hydraulic hose/fittings place with the old rubber hose and they made a new one on the spot.-It may be a fluke, but the rod on the clutch slave was too long for my truck, so I cut the rod down by about 1cm on the threaded side. It may be because another part, like my throwout bearing is worn, but I am unsure. Better too long than too short, I guess.I'm glad Amazon has parts for my truck because I've been having trouble finding parts at my local auto stores, and when I do find them, there is quite a premium to the price. Just on this clutch overhaul, I saved about 50% through Amazon. I will update this review if I have problems with these new parts. My FJ40 is all stock with ""1.5F"" engine (oil filter on passenger side, 3.9L Inline6, not 2F), stock 4speed transmission."

71534,0,"We received our ROLA cargo carrier and it looked good, and assembled easily. The hitch light assembly was not long enough, so I had to buy an extension - not the end of the world, but it should be longer considering how far back it fits from the hitch receiver (this adds alot to the overall length of your vehicle).I plugged everything in, and the right taillight did not work. I went to the autoparts store, got the new taillight (a standard size), and plugged that in. now the light worked, but the blinker and brake light function do not.I've sent two emails to ROLA support (there is no phone number listed) without an answer.I hope this isn't a harbinger. We're going on a 500+ mile trip, I'll update after that.Edited: Its been two years, and two of the 500 + mile trips.The good - it ""tows"" great - you literally do not know its there on a small SUV (Ford Escape). There are no sight line restrictions with it, it sits back and below the hatch and you essentially don't know it. As the main plastic portion is solidly built, there is no waver and no issues with wind.The bad - The rest of the item is very cheaply made. The locks on the bottom, while a great concept, are so cheap its almost laughable....and one arrived broken. The wire that holds the top to the bottom to prevent it from hitting the liftgate area came out of it's holder after six times (6) of opening and closing. The aforementioned brakelight and blinker issue was the wiring, it has not worked ever.The price to send this thing back is so prohibitive that I have it, and have to work around the issues.I had high hopes for this item - the build quality is so 180 it is amazing - the exterior shell and underpinnings are great. The locks, wiring, and other accouterments are terrible. I don't get it, but I'd rate it lower if I could after usage."

113148,0,"I bought this jacket for my husband along with the matching pants. It was difficult enough to find a set that wouldn't make him look like a Power Ranger so I settled on a black and grey combo, seemed to be the least flamboyant or clownish looking. The Pants seem to be fine and other than having to return for a smaller size (from large to medium, the legs were fine but once you got to the rear area it made him look like an inflatable lawn ornament) but the jacket was a huge disappointment. First time he put the jacket on the front zipper jumped the tracks and although we toyed with the idea of returning it we decided to keep it since we assume they installed shoddy made zippers into all of the jackets. He now has to pay special attention to how he zips it up, even if he is standing on the side of the road in the pouring rain. Now it DOES keep the rain out once you have it zipped up and as long as that zipper holds he should stay dry. Upon packing for a trip, he attempted to use the built in pocket for packing up the jacket. Well we were not surprised to find that the zipper for the built in storage pocket is equally if not even more shoddy and burst the on the first try. I am so disappointed! Tourmaster was at one time such a great company and you were able to find quality gear for a reasonable price. Now it has apparently 'outsourced', or made some other change to save money like so many others and, like everyone else the quality has suffered. I despair that we will ever again be able to find rain gear that works, we can afford, and doesn't make you look like a Power Ranger."

89984,1,"In 1991 I was piloting a commercial fishing boat from Cordova, Alaska to Bellingham, Washington. Coming into Wrangel, Alaska the #8 bearing on one of the 460 engines began to ""howl."" The mechanic told us it would be at least a month before he could look at the engine and that time delay would have put us into foul weather, come the middle of September. The mechanic drained off 2 quarts of oil and replaced the lost oil with 2 quarts of Slick-50. We headed south pushing the engines to 3200RPM, all the way, and swearing that if we heard the howl, again, we would have to put into port and ""pay the piper."" 2-1/2 days later wepulled into Bellingham, Washington. When we pulled the engine, there was no babbiting left on the bearing: just copper. I've used Slick-50 in my engines, ever since. But now the formula has changed. Why would they do that...? Why would you mess with perfection...? And, Why should I try this new watered-down formula they're trying push in our face...? Why mess with perfection...?Slick-50 has allowed me to get over 400K (and/or 9700hrs..!)miles on every vehicle (Boat;car;&Truck;) I've owned in the past 25 years and now the tried & true formula is, no longer, available.

83595,1,This is a very well built mount. Very easy to install. I bolted it to the square rear bumper of my travel trailer to mount my 4-bike rack. Setup has worked very well. Can be mounted over or under bumper. Very stronger and high quality.
55045,1,Works as described. I am a infrequent rider of my motorcycle and this tender/charger keeps my motorcycle ready for riding any time. I surely recommend this product to anyone looking for a battery tender/charger.

75115,1,"I bought these shocks to replace a leaking shock on my 2003 GMC Sonoma . So I decided to replace all 4 with KYB. I did not notice a big difference from to old GM shocks to the new KYB ones. I have bought this brand before when I had a 2000 S10 with a ZQ8 suspension, and loved the ride. But the new ones are a little to soft for me. That is why I gave it a 4 out of 5. The shocks are a good deal for the money."
61290,1,This is a wonderful find My motorcycle takes this particular filter (without mods) which no paper filter can compare thank you Amazon for carrying this filter.
178877,1,"I took a chance on this cover as it was far from the most expensive. I was pleased with the quality. It is of thicker material than I was expecting. The fit is really good with elastic around the front and back of the cover and grommets mid-way on both sides. I live in a windy area and the cover stays securely on the truck. There is nothing abrasive on the cover to cause rub marks. I also receive a lot of intense sun so we shall see how it holds up but 1 month out it's, so far so good. I'm glad I made this purchase."
140401,1,"I have a set of aluminum rims which are a pain to clean and maintain. I used to use Meguiar's wheel cleaners, which removed the dirt and dust but never made the rims shiny. I did some research online and bought Mother's Mag and Aluminum Polish. I have to say its an awesome product. I used a polishing cone, which I attached to my drill to make the whole process faster and easier. Polishing 4 18"" rims by hand would take for ever. It did take a few hours to clean all 4 rims but the after effects were amazing! From far away they look as if they are chrome. I highly recommend this product. Check out the pics I uploaded."
71687,1,Replaced the stock air filter on my Suzuki GS500 with this. Very easy swap in about 15 minutes. Great price for a high performance filter.
11325,2,"I was very disappointed in this item. After looking at my local Lowe's for this item (they didn't have it though they would gladly order me one for over $500!!!) No thanks, I could get a two-stage snowblower for that. Anyway, my dozer blade arrived via Fedex 3 weeks after I ordered it. The day it arrived, we received 8 inches of snow. I was anxious to install and get busy clearing the driveway. The box arrived in decent shape. I opened the box and did a quick inventory of the parts before getting to work. I was very disappointed to find that most of the hardware was missing. I had to drive back to Lowe's in the snow and spend about $11 buying hardware so I could install the blade. Then, I found out that the seller packed two right-side frame brackets. I needed a left-side bracket and a right-side bracket. I figured out a workaround. Later, I found another poor design issue that I couldn't overcome with a workaround. I will be calling the manufacturer's customer support line tomorrow because I was unable to use the blade tonight on my driveway. In hindsight, I should have bought a snow blower."
131653,0,"i'm usually very happy with dowco products. this scooter cover is okay, but not as thick as i thought it would be and kind of a one size doesn't fit all. Its too big."
113705,0,"This is a very well made set of adapters of various shapes and sizes.My problem is they connect to a male bananna type connector vs fluke type. Or you can use their little adapter which screws onto the end of a threaded test probe. So, instead of plugging directly in, you plug into their adapter, which screws onto the threaded test probe, which then finally plugs into the meter leads.The purpose of getting this set was to have a good positive connection and eliminate the use of multiple homemade spade adapters and aligator clips leaving exposed connections. What I ended up with is the need to find a fluke to bananna adapter, 2 more connections I'd rather not have to worry about when testing and, another dangit it aint gonna work.3 stars since they're well made and would probably work well for the old timers still using their simpson analog metersUpdate 11/18/12A trip to my local electrical supply store, and I got some simpson to fluke adapters, so now they work great. Bring your fluke leads and this kit into the store so they know what it is you're looking for."

118718,1,The grit guard is a basic utility but is a staple of every single car wash. The grit guard saves your mitts and saves your paint by not allowing the wash mitt to sit in the dirty water at the bottom of your wash bucket.The only think better would be a taller grit guard.
21765,0,"I had great trouble getting these on and off a 2007 Ford Focus. The tire had sunk a little bit the day before into now frozen icy snow, and as such the clearance around the tire was restricted -- not by much but there is very little clearance to work with when attaching. It was most aggravating. After chipping away at the ice around the tire, I finally got it on, but it did not bode well for the times I would have even less favorable conditions.I also tried the Z Chain -- easier to install given the extra wiggle room, but on the uninstall it got tied up behind the wheel given the tight clearances. I got real dirty on that one. Perhaps if you kept your car garaged it would be an easier set up -- but in my location install happens outside and then removing them will undoubtedly happen in an unplowed parking lot at best. I'm going to invest in Thule K Summit system."
26808,0,"If you are buying this unit because of price and features beware! I can tell you as I am looking at the product right now the discription ""Continuously display the charging current or battery voltage on the LCD digital meter"" does NOT apply to this unit. But the discription below it ""Automatically indicates the charged condition of your battery on the LED bar graph"" is accurate. So if your good with that buy it. I haven't used it and I'm not going to so I can't comment on how it works, but the other reviews seem positive."
103877,2,The locking arm doesn't work so I took it off and put a pole under the extension when I want to use it. Now it's much sturdier.
130197,0,"I purchased these for a 2002 Olds Aurora. These were more expensive than average but felt the desire to ""upgrade"" to a nicer blade. On the positive side, they do install very easily. Unfortunately, the blade doesn't conform to the windshield as much as you might think - the last 2 inches of the passenger side blade didn't touch the glass until the blade was 6-8 inches up from the at-rest position. This left an unwiped spot down low on the glass - not enough to cause concern but also not what I'd expect from a premium priced blade. I tried them only for one day; it snowed about 1-2 inches. The blades picked up water/snow at the end of each travel and smeared across the glass. I never had a full cleared windshield for the 6 minute test drive. They do provide a slight improvement in your view because of their lower profile, but wipers are there to clean the glass! I just didn't see anything ""ultimate"" about these. I feel better having gone back to standard blades that cost less and perform equal or slightly better, as well as wiping *all* of the glass."
26054,0,"The bars installed OK, but when tightening down the u-bolts they bent with just a rachet wrench. Gotta figure out what else I can use. Otherwise, they'll need constant re-tightening until they break."
155348,0,"Too light but that depends on what You use If for. I use It to as a outer cover for Water hoes then with the uses of a hair dryer thaw out My Water lines, but threading My Water lines through It, It tears apart too easy but Not as bad a dryer vent hose. The best thing I have found for Water lines Is If possible go to Lowes and get some 4' flexible sewer drain line this method works much better than heat tape You can use far less heat tape and You do Not always know If the heat tape works or Not."
71104,1,"I bought this because a Jeep was stolen out of the parking lot at my employer's building. Later I was informed that the older model Jeep was probably stolen because they are so easy to steal. Since I have an older model Jeep too, I bought this.I don't live in a high crime area, so I'm sure this device will turn thieves away toward easier prey. However, I have been told, not sure about the reliability of the source though, that thieves will just cut the steering wheel with bolt cutters to remove the device.So, I suppose it's possible that a determined and prepared thief might be able to get past this pretty easily. Something to look into if you are in a higher crime area. There are other designs out there that I think address this problem.As for putting it on and off the car, very simple, and I use it everyday at work now."
39802,2,"This Tire Inflator Compressor is the worst one that I have ever Purchased. Do not Purchase this Compressor if You want something that will last. I very rarely use it and after a few uses it did not have Pressure. My brother found that the inflator hose had melted and was leaking. We cut it and reattached the hose and it worked for a few more times. The hose melted again and now there is no pressure, so the problem is not just the hose this time. I am purchasing a new inflator and hoping that the Viair 85P will last longer."
126291,1,THIS PRODUCT WORKED AS IT WAS DESIGNED. MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE FOR TWO APPLICATIONS AS THE TUBE HOLDS A LOT OF THE MATERIAL. DESCRIPTION SEEMS ACCURATE FOR THIS PRODUCT.
175837,0,"I've had my Magic Shade for my other vehicle for years and its still going strong. This product has the same feel to it but, unfortunately, the shade is a little smaller than the windshield on my other car. So the tops do not quite fit and tend to fall. The sun visor on both the driver and passenger side need to be open to hold the shade in place."
173108,1,"I am happy with the overall performance of the headlight beams. Since I do a lot of night driving in rural areas having a good high beam is very important to me. What is lacking is the lifespan of this bulb. After trying most of the major bulbs on the market I would say the lifespan of this bulb is average... which is not good. If you use your high beams like I do, a 3-6 mo lifespan is all I get. I assume that part of the problem is in the overall design of the headlight unit itself as heat buildup is a killer along with the turning off and on repetition. I would like to see a better bulb developed."
157864,1,Pretty much the same tnah other towers but these ones allow to take off and put back so easy since the landing pads kept atteched to the car.
102844,2,"This item was ordered for one 3000 mile trip. 1500 down to FL and 1500 back to NH. The heat and vibration aspects get a four out of five and are still working well as of this writing. The method of securing this to the car seat gets a one because there is no zero. The first of the two seat back straps broke at 500 miles. The remaining one is still working but is insufficient to hold this in place. The straps for holding the bottom portion to the seat are absolutely useless and are the cheapest thing in the construction. It should also be noted that there is no way to enter and exit the vehicle that allows the cushion to remain in place. A woman with a silk dress couldn't do it. If you are flexible enough to climb out of the sunroof and lower yourself back in the same way, then the cushion MIGHT stay in place. I however, am not that flexible so be prepared to spend another five minutes of adjusting after every gas stop. Duck taping or super gluing the cushion to the actual car seat could work but...really!"
39053,0,"The waist and length are just right. I wear a 34W 32L pant size and the thigh area is diffucult to pull up to where it needs to be. I am by no means thick around the thighs. If I ordered a larger size, I would have excess in the waist and in the length, so pick your poison. Otherwise a good value and high quality product."
51987,2,It is too big for my car. Luckily my moms a seamstress and she can alter it but amazon is so deceiving. They said that it can fit.
119164,1,"This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car."

Maybe for high horsepower performance engines but not noticeable on an average car.Still keeps you from buying numerous cheap filters over a cars lifetime.I'm still lucky my 14 year old towncar still gets 17 mpg city just like the sticker on it's window rated it when new.K&N; 33-2272 Replacement Air Filter"
153690,2,"The instructions are poor and the unit will not work with my application. Apparently, there are different types of resistors used on sending units.

44243,0,"When i ordered this i probably should have waited until i had a better understanding of what i needed. One problem for me is thae the display is hard to read when it is laying flat on my workbench. Especialy the top of the display which shows if it is displaying in ohms, kilo-ohms or megaohms. If i had to do it over again i would not have bought an auto-ranging meter. Otherwise it works good."

184321,2,Both the drain cap and the larger top cap leaks oil no matter how well you tighten it. Grid on top fell in when I set the oil filter to drain on it. I bought to save myself time in the clean up. I lost more time than any I could have potentially saved.
55828,2,"This item is NOT WATERPROOF if your buying this to put on your trailer that sits outside hoping to keep the water off of it do not buy it.

103860,0,The sink cover works but not more. I needed it because my cats love the sink and sleep in there or eat everything that is left on a plate. I bought this item because it was one of the few I found.It says it will not rattle but that seems to be depending on the size of your sink. It works kind of OK on one of mine and not that great on the other.It does the job of not letting my cats in so it is OK.

120237,1,"Remove 3 screws from the lower steering column cover. Pull apart the upper and lower covers for access. Put the key in and lower the gearshift to neutral (provides room for pin to come out). Tap out the pin that holds the gearshift in place. Unplug the wire harness. Just slide the old one off, slide the new one on, and put it back together. 15-20 minutes and no big bill!"
161531,2,"Nice item, but due to the way it hangs on the wall (I am lead to believe this is to help cool it) the weight pulls the top of the plug out the socket enough to expose the top of the electrical pins. I've uploaded a photo. This is not acceptable in a household with children!"
54956,2,"Failed after only two months. Disappointed. I did nothing extraordinary, or abuse the charger. Just kept a 12v deep cycle charged in the float mode."

1148,2,"Okay, thought I was getting a deal here, but this kit just connects the car wires to the pigtail and isn't any better than ""just"" a pigtail. Called the company and they said the 2003 Ford Crown Vic does NOT need the circuit protection ""anymore."" Noticed that it was changed on other Crown Vic year models also. Not sure if I need circuit protection or not with this car, but got a kit that wires directly to the car battery, just in case. My trailer has a bunch of lights and it's probably cheaper to get the more expensive kit from another company, (Tow Ready 119176KIT from etrailer.com $65) just in case."
157179,1,"This steering wheel cover is very comfortable to grip (it has &#34;bumps&#34; on the sides where you put your hands). Before I installed the cover, I heated it up with a hair dryer for about 5 minutes to make the material more flexible. My only disappointment with it, after installation, is that I've had the &#34;bumps&#34; slide out of alignment (the &#34;10&#34; and &#34;2&#34; positions on the steering wheel) twice so far."
90913,1,"For those of you who perfer a non-grit waterless hand cleaner, this is it. If you are out and about, camping, biking, or whatever, take some along as after using this product, it leaves no grit behind.Also, this is a great product to apply to stains on clothing before washing. Even if it is left to dry, it will reactivate with the wash water to get the stains out.After purchasing this product thru Amazon, it arrived quicker that it said it would and in great condition. Thanks Amazon, for making this product easy to find and purchase, as most retailers in my area don't carry this product."
188037,1,"Excellent product! They really make the brakes feel much firmer more solid than the stock brake lines. Expensive, but worth it!!"
65838,2,"Had these in a previous truck 2 yrs prior, wore like iron! Manufacturer changed material to cheaper stretch-poly, netting for pouches, equal to covers half the cost! Very disappointed in the quality after being excited that I thought I'd found the exact-same product. Not worth the money! Buyer beware!"
52900,1,"I highly recommend this product. It is well hidden behind the bumper and isn't unsightly one bit. It is easy to install, although I do recommend having a helping hand, as it is difficult to hold above your head and line up the bolt holes. But with someone to help hold it for you, it is quick and easy to install, probably 5-10 minutes for a novice (my vehicle had factory - threaded bolt holes in place). Make sure that you purchase and/or have someone install the proper wiring harness for your vehicle, as this product doesn't include the wiring harness (as they vary greatly from one vehicle to another), universal wiring harnesses are available but require knowledge and skill of vehicle and trailer wiring for the DIYer. Also you will need to purchase the right size of ball (e.g. 1 7/8"", 2"", etc.), most hitches do not include this because of the varying sizes and the need to have the correct size."
68895,1,"The price for this filter ($31.00) was less than the OEM paper filter you have to replace every 6000 to 7000 miles. And the beauty of K & N filters is when dirty you just wash it with K & N cleaner & water & just let air dry,then reoil with K & N filter spray oil. Also the filter will probably out live your bike."
39447,1,"I noticed that after I changed my filter, my bike seemed to be breathing better and really accerates to the redline quicker. K&N is one of the best and this is cheaper than at my local bike shop, I use them in all my machines now. It is Economical when you buy two or more over the long haul, good protection from dirtst and du, especially where I live where its always dusty and dry. Gotta have an air filter so might as well get the best..."

44503,0,"Installed this in two Mazda 6 cars in the Summer of 2010. The Summer of 2012 the one Mazda 6 that we still own started getting a dead battery when it was not used for a week or so. This car has recently passed only 15,000 miles so the battery should not be bad. I tested it with a tool that performs a drain test and it was bad. I replaced the battery and the dead battery problem came back. The only thing that stopped the battery from draining was to unhook the Bulldog Remote Starter. I plan to upgrade to a better brand next Summer."

37740,0,"Yet again the quality was fine. The problem again lies in the ""Universal-Fit"" The floor mats were to long for my car! So the only way I could have used them is if there was around an inch rolled over either at the driver's seat OR under the gas and brake. Neither of which was safe because they would shift while driving and keep you from fully depressing the brakes when you need them."
87299,0,"This is a pretty basic item. I bought it because jerky scum in SW Washington steal other people's drift boat trailers while those people are on the river. Jerks aside, the locking pin is a pretty basic design. The plastic cover for the locking mechanism will probably fall off the first time I hit a bump though. It would not have cost over five cents to attach the cover to the lock in some manner, I bet. Oh well, the lock will get full of grit and fail. Then I'll buy a different brand."
104034,1,"Found this in the warehouse deals as used, but brand new in box and still is. I used the old chain and have this as a spare."

172850,2,"I ordered three sets of these reflectors. Out of the six, 2 of them had malformed reflectors, as if they had partially melted during the manufacturing process. As well, all of them have very thin plastic at the nail hole, suggesting a relatively short lifespan no matter what. All in all, a lousy product."

88042,1,I'm skeptical of infomercial products but this one DELIVERED AS PROMISED! People always ooh and ahh on my 2001 BMW's finish.I don't know which is the biggest positive point: 1) Ease of application and removal or; 2) No white crap on your rubber trim 3) hides minor swirl marks 4) makes windshield glass smooth and wiper blades stop chattering.Worth every penny
75922,2,"I purchased two of these. Both leak through the valve stem and are useless. I'm no valve expert, but perhaps running some water through these to see if they leak would be a good quality control check for the Chinese manufacturer. The ones I received were in boxes labeled Four Seasons."

The filter did fine until on the interstate; there it threw a check engine light. Worried, I returned home and plugged my OBD II reader in with no avail. I think my reader may be bad. I disconnected the negative battery terminal and waited for the morning. The car ran fine for the next four days with no CEL. Then I had to merge on the interstate today. I had to accelerate fast, and another check engine light. I think the engine is just too lean under these circumstances.Also, the cold air intake hose is not long enough. Using the provided instructions, I cannot understand how to route the house without cutting some of the the plastic cowling under the motor.In addition, the hose would be under the car. It would probably get full of road crud. I rerouted mine toward the air intake at the front bumper.The engine noise considerably increases with this mod.Finally, I hope to have better mpg and hp from this filter. With the commentary above, I cannot past judgement on the filter at this time. I have very good mechanical skills, so I do not believe this to be an install issue. I will be contacting K&N.;I will update ASAP."

137222,1,Wheelskins are the best leather steering wheel wraps. I have tried others but have been disapointed. I have a wheelskin wrap on the steering wheel of each of my vehicles. They may be a little more expensive than some of the other wraps but they are definatly worth it. They are made of quality leather and fit smoothly and tigtly to the steering wheel.They are easy to install and last years without loosing their shape. They feel luxurious on the steering wheel and add to the pleasure of driving.

184618,1,"This is a great bandanna for wearing under my helmet, especially on the hot days. It keeps my head cool and my forehead dry. It is an easier bandanna to wear, since it pretty much comes already to go you just tie the two ties on the back of your head."

101487,1,I bought this for my 2011 BMW G650GS and have no complaints. The installation was smooth and everything fit as it should. Don't forget to install the foam restrictor if you're not going to get a custom tune! It's nice that this was thought of and included.
1369,1,"I bought this product because, I had purchased a Bulldog Alarm system for my MGB. Well, after nearly five years of daily use the transmitter finally 'bit the dust' but, I must say the alarm unit is still doing it's job. I was glad that I found another transmitter to replace my old one, and at a reasonable price, I might add. I Would highly recommend any of the Bulldog products to any of my friends."

141899,0,This solar panel worked great for 3 years then stopped providing any voltage to the controller. I took it off the roof and dissenbled it. I found the ground wire disconnected from the panel. I managed to solder it back in place and also re-soldered the positive wire to the panel to ensure conductivity. It has provided reliable service since then. But for someone of less techinal abiltity they are going to probably throw it out. What a shame.
4048,1,I bought two sets and put them on my 89 bronco and 88 f-150. They fit fine and seem to be of good quality.
69528,0,This Belkin inverter is much louder than the 140 watt inverter (which is difficult to hear at all). You can easily drowned out the noise with your radio but the pitch was a little too high for me.The 300 watt unit is only a little bigger with a second outlet than the 140 watt inverter. It comes with an automotive type fuse (30 amp) which does seem to be very useful if your car lighter fuse is 10 or 15 amp.
21747,2,"I installed the cable chains (Security Chain Co., SZ339 Shur Grip) on front drive wheels of my car. I tried to drive up a moderate slope asphalt paved drive with some snow and ice. The drive tires spun on the asphalt and never gained traction even after repeated slow controlled starts. I removed the chains and drove up the asphalt drive with no problem except for some minor slipping on the ice and snow. On reason for the failure could be the cable chain design. The cross cables have wire rings which just spin on the bare asphalt and never gained traction. Very disappointing! On the positive side: Amazon's return policy and process was great."

161720,1,"Considering it's just a black steering wheel cover, it is made with great quality! After slipping the cover on, it felt weird. The next morning it transformed to the wheel and grips it firmly. Looks much better and I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality product. The wheel of course is Genuine leather and was around $20 USD."
139497,0,"When I got mine it showed a too-low psi. The weather was a bit cold. I put the device in the windowsill to warm up and then tried it and it worked normal. I took it apart and saw that the part that moves the needle is a curved copper ""lung"" that of course would be more resistant to movement in the cold because cold makes metal more stiff."
146535,2,This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.
13338,2,"I ordered two sets of these from Amazon for use leveling a tiny house on a trailer that I am building. At the time I purchased them, the total weight of the trailer was just 3000 lbs. The jacks started breaking at the very first use. The hardware that holds the hex head onto the handle sheared off. This happened eventually on all four handles. The jacks were also extremely difficult to turn. Needless to say, these were returned to Amazon immediately. Do yourself a favor, and buy something that's more expensive and better quality."

109597,2,"The compressor sometimes stalls if you try and start it after connecting the airline to the tire first. Oh, and when it stalls it will also blow the fuse to the accessory outlet in your car. I also find that now after a couple months the quick connect on the air line to the compressor leaks a large amount of air unless I hold it and keep pressure on it - the included air line is a piece of junk.On the plus side the compressor is solidly built, runs very well off my battery charger, and is faster than the combo emergency light/compressor I intended to replace. But I can not count on it to run off the car due to the stalls and blown fuses, so it remains n the garage, where I would have been better of with a 120V unit."

43931,0,The product does what it says. It has some issues with my 2001 Subaru Outback but I was able to get around it to address my needs. I did speak with their support and there is a chipset upgrade you would need to send the unit in for. After that it should work with anything I guess.
185702,1,I put this on my son's bike and he really enjoys it. Be careful of the mounting bracket and don't over tighten it. The bracket will start bending and it seem like it's not tightening.
94237,2,All the sites that i have seen this plug on state that it has a Removable Terminal Nut. The package i received in the mail came without the Removable Terminal Nut. I am somewhat unhappy with that and the only way for me to use this plug is for me to cut the top down to size to fit my coil sticks on them.Here is a ling of the same plug with a Removable Terminal Nut:[...]This really sucks and now i have to spend money at a machine shop to modify the plug.

148025,2,"Bought this gauge for my wife and her new car. Put it in a tool box in the trunk without even using it. Two months later decided to check the tire pressures with it. Unfortunately a bottle of window cleaner had fallen over in the trunk and leaked. Seems despite the gauge being in a tool box and the window cleaner outside the toolbox, it managed to collect enough moisture to short out the batteries and the device was dead with droplets of water covering the digital display. Never got to use it once. Think mechanical gauges are more robust. Never had a problem with the old stick kind, and they are lot cheaper."
50979,1,"Thank you Amazon for providing this product at the best price. It looks great in my 08 Ford Escape. Easy to install with little knowledge . works great, compass is very accurate and temperature read out is perfect I would highly recomend this product."
146340,0,it fit but it appears to have missed that a large rivet in the frame. it needed a hole drilled 1/2 inch to clear the huge rivet
52446,1,I bought this to replace another brand that never worked. I found it to be not that hard to install compaired to the other one (DEI-BOA). As a basic start/stop the car unit it seems to work fine.
32012,2,"Bought this, charged it and set it aside until needed. Took it out few months later, battery dead and won't take charge. Why bother having a ""backup"" if it dies long before you need it."
172287,1,"I have never experienced a paint like this before. It is very thin, but on the first coat it goes on deep black with excellent coverage. It clings onto rust and metal leaving a tough, shiny black gloss. I usually end up pouring more into the paint tray than what I really need. Use a piece of plastic kitchen wrap before putting the cover back on and wipe the rim of the can, otherwise it will get welded shut. I used this on things like my rusty pool pump mount, SUV trailer hitch, wiper mounts, outside of a drain pipe, and a lot more. Once you buy a can, it will last for many projects (longer than expected) so I recommend to buy a smaller size first. Also get some small disposable brushes and disposable latex gloves."
76116,1,"I'm impressed with the volume which this absorbent material soaks up. I use it to wipe down my jetski after each usage. It removes water from nearly all hard-to-reach places and leaves the craft virtually dry. Conventional towels or other rags would take 2-3 wipings, and this thing seems to act like a squeegee, except it doesn't push the water, it soaks it up.I am giving this product 4 stars in hopes that it will be 5 (let's see how it stands up over time) in a few months."
35443,0,"this unit works great once you get the bloody thing installed. The installation is a nightmare if you don't have a fairly comprehensive understanding of automotive installation. I'd recommend you find a good installer that will install this particular unit into your vehicle before you buy. Installers in my area refused to install it, but did help me sort out a few of the wires I was unable to find in my car. Now that its working I love it, but it wasnt worth the stress of putting it in myself. The tech support people are knowledgable and helpfull on the phone, but they can only assist so much over a phone line.That was my experience. Good luck"
153222,1,The shade is high quality and works really well at keeping the car cool. My only complaint is it has a crinkle foil feel/sound when I fold it up. I do not know how long this will last but so far it has held up.
120317,1,We use this pad to warm the hydraulic oil on one of the gun club's Pat traps. The hydraulic control valve on the trap does not function well when cold and this pad really makes a difference. Highly recommended. Good product.
61358,2,"The first problem I noted was it came not in a retail package but in a brown box. There were no instructions or paperwork of any kind. The next problem was finding a location to mount the device. The cable on. The AC adapter is only a couple of feet long so if AC isn't close to where you intend to mount it. Finally the biggest problem is the motion sensor doesn't work. The laser would come on briefly, bit no movement would trigger the laser to come on. After all the fiddling mine finally wound up in a box in my garage. I would never buy this product again."
119505,2,"You have to be an artist to match the color correctly. Even if you get it to match when the mix is wet, the color changes somewhat when it dries. Looked better with the small whole than it does now."
18702,1,This is exactly what we were looking for and the extra pockets were a great feature for this product. I would recommend.
19162,2,"Dear friends, I make the purchase of this product I was accepted, I was charged to my credit card, I was assigned a purchase order after the order charged did not then appear and I have no way of tracking that purchase, I would like to know which was the that way, if you do not have the product Deveria publish, that we the buyers do not go through the hassle that this generates, time and hassle, thanks."

91132,1,"Looked all over and finially found this filter here. Lowest price anywhere. Not exactly like the original filter, but it fit fine. Haven't noticed any different in mileage yet, but only put on about about 200 miles. Like the idea, never have to buy another motorcycle filter for my bike, ever. Recieved it very fast from Amazon Thanks, Jim"
48735,2,Great machine until it's 10th use. Simply stopped working and there is no way to repair it if out of warranty. Wasn't abused in any way. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Spend a few more bucks and buy a better quality compressor!!
124516,1,Excellent non-contact thermometer for use in the kitchen. I use it to measure the temperature of the pancake griddle. It has a dual display. The main display is the instantaneous reading and there's a smaller max-hold in the upper right corner. Has a bright orange LED back light. (Display is translucent so you see the innards. That's a bit annoying.) Front button allows switching from F to C.
42681,1,"I did both head lights 3 times in sucession and each time the lights got cleaner and cleaner and after about 15 minutes I was done, I used very little of the product and didn't have to rub very hard to get results,It's similar to applying car wax,I'm very happy with the results and now my head lights look new again."
42445,1,This machine works great. air compressor pretty loud but it works great. Great to have during black outs or flat tires.

24158,0,"Roof top carrier worked on a ski trip we took to Colorado over Christmas break 2010. Carrier was weather proof the entire trip. We experienced a lot of icing on the carrier as well. I used it for the trip traveling to Colorado from Texas without any problems. On the return trip I had the carrier broken down flat on the roof with the cover attached and did not exerience any problems. I ran 70-80 mph with no issues. I would not recommend driving with the carrier empty and open on top of a vehicle. It needs some items in the carrier when extended for it to ride without flapping and moving around.The big issue I had was related to quality of construction. It took two returns to finally get a carrier that was in good working order. The first carrier I received had damage to the aluminum frame (broken rivets). I called Amazon about the issue and they promptly sent a next day replacement to me at no charge and provided a prepaid UPS label for me to return the defective product. Unfortunately, the replacement carrier also had defective parts. One of the straps on the front cover was not completely sewn to the carrier, and the cargo cover seam ripped the first time I tried to tighten the strap. Again, I explained my issues with Amazon and they graciously sent another replacement with a prepaid UPS label for the return. The third time was the charm since all parts appear to be in good working order. I give high marks to Amazon customer service but low marks to the quality of workmanship. What do you expect: it is made in China."
129015,2,"The LCD panel is bright and legible. The LED lights provide a quick overview. The unit correctly identifies the monitoring mode, battery vs. charging. I personally found the 2-decimal place voltage reading unnecessary and distracting while driving.I suspect the voltage reading is not totally accurate; one of my cars has a brand new charging system and battery, 6 months since they were installed and less than 2500 miles in usage, but the battery voltage reading tethers 12.3v. I get the same reading on my other car as well. I hooked up both cars to a battery tender and with the tender in floating mode (indicating the battery is basically fully charged) the voltage reading still doesn't exceed 12.4v and the battery icon shows the batteries about half charged. I believe a few other people have reported a similar problem with the battery icon."
162045,2,"Fit was okay for my 2009 Civic, but material (carpet) was very flimsy, so much so that you could easily see light through it. I returned it for a refund and will look elsewhere for a dashboard cover of higher quality."
78533,2,The crotch and inside leg seams ripped apart the first time it was worn. Not a very happy experience with this product.
89122,0,"Having taken an age to be delivered, it finally arrived. Plan ahead - this isn't going to arrive in a hurry, and in my experience, not on the 2nd or 3rd scheduled delivery date. Oh, the 4th time it did arrive. On the back of an 18 wheeler. With no lift gate.Putting the unit together (fixing the handles and wheels in place) was a little interesting - as a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, you have to pull out a stabilizer bolt to get the wheel brackets in place. That alone means you need two people to, safely, get the job done.That said, when I oiled & gassed it up, flicked the switch, it fired up first time.I have been starting it up every month or so, as recommended in the user manual, running it for 10 or 15 minutes at a time. It's been about a year now and I have not had to pull the starter cord more than once each time to get it started.We did end up using it last winter: saved us a whole mess of problems. I was running a couple of sump pumps, a 240V well pump, first floor lighting circuit (4 rooms) and two family refrigerators.For the amount of money we saved in *not* having to re-finish the basement, as other people in our street did because of flooding, this generator is a bargain.Oh, and while it is 'quiet' running, at 3am in the morning, ANYTHING sounds loud. Hey, if it wasn't for me and my generator, no one else in the street would have known the power was out."
129206,1,The damper itself does exactly what it's supposed to. My only complaint is that I had to re use the metal sleeves for the bushings out of the old dampener and the mount from the old dampener. Overall an easy problem to work around. My application was for a 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
37234,1,I bought one 5 years ago and it just now tore up. I just bought my second one. I really enjoyed my first one.
149260,2,"This Gel type of seat cushion was lousy in every way. It's too small for your backside when sitting down, plus the way that it is slanted was to uncomfortable an essentially pushed me forward to much. You may notice the same issues -"
27313,2,"It's completely different from description and photo. Open the box to assemble 4 pieces - cushion, seat bracket, pneumatic shock, and wheel base. Look underneath the cushion to find the screws to attach bracket to the seat. After attaching the bracket to the seat, place wheel base on the floor. Put shock into hole on wheel base. Place seat bracket on top of shock. End of assembly.PROS: Seat is comfortable.Wheel base is square with 4 red wheelsEasy assemblyCONS: No all-steel constructionWheels are plasticNot durable - Instead, it's built for occasional, light usagePneumatic shock did not work at allDoes not stay assembled when picked-up by the seatI think the manufacturer substituted a much cheaper-quality seat and did not tell Amazon. With gentle usage it should last one year. If everything worked it would be worth about $20. But definitely not professional quality or worth the money paid."
106921,0,"I bought the standard black and white Hella 500 covers a couple years ago when I got the lights, and yes, they were kind of snug fitting, it took a little doing to snap them on and off, but by the same token, they stayed on well at high speeds and over rough roads. However, when I took them off for a drive this fall, the plastic just fell apart- the formerly solid and uncracked cover absolutely disintegrated in my hands. My guess is UV damage from being in the sun. Wanting to continue to protect my lights, I learned about the clear covers, and promptly bought a pair. They are very slick, but i see two problems right off the bat- I am a little concerned that they are much less securely mounted, with four corner clips instead of the 360 wrap around lip on the black and whites, and a related issue is that being a flat piece of plastic up against the light, its obvious that there will be problems with dirt and water both getting trapped between the shield and the light. So while i am excited about being able to use the shields with the lights on while driving, its clear that they will bear watching and regular cleaning to get the full effect of the lights. And i've decided to get another pair of the B&W covers, despite my prior experience, to fully protect the lights in the snowy off season when they are not being used regularly; i'm hoping that maybe with regular applications of Armorall, or 303 Protectant, the new pair will outlast the old ones."
95201,2,"I purchased 8 each, of this item, Bosch (4509) HGR9LQI0 9 Platinum IR Fusion Spark Plug, Pack of 1. A rebate was offered at the time of purchase that amounted to about $30.00. I applied for the rebate by completing the rebate form, and sending in everything the offer required. Eight weeks later I was informed that my request for the rebate was denied - the old UPC code was not sent in as required, was stated as the reason for denial. I had sent in everything, but the spark plugs, yet my rebate claim was still denied. I never expected this company to use this old ""bait and Switch"" policy. Needless to say, I'll never purchase another product from this company again. I'm also telling all of my 'facebook & email friends' about what this company is doing."
26433,0,"Seller said they would send an email when shipped. They DIDN'T send email; and while item did finally ship and arrive, it did NOT ship by the promised date. Tracking info thru Amazon was no help on this particular item because it was not updated regularly; just showed up in my mailbox. Other than delayed shipping on the part of the seller (Pacific Industrial Components), item was as promised and I was happy with the product itself. I wouldn't advise buying from this seller unless you are not in any hurry to get your item shipped."

180449,1,"Shipping was fast. Installation was pretty easy. Purchased the product based on the reviews from amazon customers. I thought I would just give it a try anyway. I am pleased to say I am happy with my choice and as far as the noise, doesnt bother me one bit."
99501,1,I followed the instructions including the reviews as posted in Amazon. As long as you push the lift gate up to its maximum opening there is no problem replacing these and they work fine. Another person helping does help but it can be done with a prop and by yourself.
158862,2,"I bought this converter hoping that I could convert my newer 250gb SATA hard drive to IDE so that I can use it to replace a 20gb IDE hard drive. I mainly use this computer to watch video and listen to music even though it's getting old (pentium-4). After installing this converter, I can transfer files onto the SATA drive no problem, but i get all kinds of crackling noise and popping sounds from my speakers when playing music or video from the converted SATA drive. The video (mkv, avi) is also very jittery and starts & stops frequently. The computer even downgraded the SATA drive to PIO mode after playing a couple songs, which means the converter or drive itself is having major communication issues. My feeling is that the converter is fine for routine backups of files, or even basic computing like ms office. But FORGET audio/video. I would be interested to hear if anyone has experienced a/v related issues after installing this converter. Or.. has anyone tried to burn a CD or DVD using this converter connected to their SATA CD/DVD burner? &lt;---That answer would help solve this problem."
35926,0,"The pads look fine. However, I was not expecting to see a ""made in China"" stamp on a Beck Arnley product.

132714,1,"Used the RV9YC to replace the plugs in a Mercruiser 470. Perfect fit. They are a little expensive, but if you live as far from the parts store as I do, it's worth it.

43724,1,"Does what it says it does. If you need to pull codes then it works great. Dont expect it to tell you what is causing your problem. Thats not how these work. For example; If you have a cylinder misfiring it will give you a code telling you what the problem is, but not what is causing that cylinder to be out"
41946,0,"I purchased the Hella Optilux 1250 Blue Ion Carbon Fiber Fog Lights recently thinking that they were some of the best according to what I read. I had mine installed professionally. When I got my truck back I noticed that one of the lights was completely white and not a yellow fog light. The other one was very yellow with a blue lens. I wrote the company, when I eventually found them on the web, and told them about this. I did get a response in a few days and I was told that they were going to go to the warehouse and find me a yellow light replacement. About a week later they sent me another E-mail saying they were going to send the replacement to me. I got the replacement and right away noticed that it too was not very yellow like the other one nor did it have a blue lens like it is suppose to. The replacement is slightly yellow however compared to the totally white lens I had gotten originally so I went ahead and took the white one off my truck and put the slightly yellow one on. When I shine them on my garage door you can plainly see that one is yellow but the other is more of a beige. I wrote the company again to let them know that this was still not right but this time I was ignored. I got no response but I am going to try writing them again and see if I get this resolved. I am disappointed in the inconsistent lenses and there customer service for ignoring me the second time. If I can get them to send me another dark yellow housing with a blue lens I would be very happy with this product. They seem like they are built well and come with a nice wiring harness etc. Well,I tried E-mailing the company one more time but they still are ignoring me so I personally will not buy products from this company again. People should get what they pay for, not half of what they pay for.Update.... Okay, I just got a call from Hella and they have found out that there was a problem with some of these lamps not being yellow. So he is sending me a whole new kit and personnally hand picked them to make sure that they are yellow ones. Now I am going to give kudos on the customer service here because he appologies for not getting back with me in a timely manner and now is sending me the proper lamps so I will update this again when I get the new ones in about 5 days or so. The guy that is now taking care of this has been extremely nice so I am hoping that what he is sending me is the right because I would like to change this review completely."
49883,0,Dodge Ram Head Logo Universal Bucket Seat CoverWell I got it alot sooner than expected.As a female trying to hook my car up it was fairly easy and I just love how it complements the rest of my dodge stuff for my car.Only flaw is if you have a newer model like i do then the two strings in the front won't stretch to the back.Just tuck them under and it will be fine.
51982,2,"If you think that this will give you step by step instructions you'd be wrong. It's basically a good reference to look up what things are called and where they're located. But at that point, I jumped onto Toyota forums for more details...youtube was also a great help. Unfortunately I had to open the wrapping to find this out."
180352,1,they were the same as the ones I bought for the 2004 I have but were a lot cheaper and of the same quality
91581,0,"I don't like the plastic swivel anchors they use in wiper blades nowadays. If you bump them with an ice-scraper, or let the wiper snap back onto the windshield too hard, it breaks the reatiner clip. Then, when you really need your wipers the most, it comes loose from the wiper arm. In my case, the metal wiper arm ran a big scratch across my windshield. Now, I look for all-metal blade bodies."
162401,0,This charger does what it is supposed to do...charge a battery. It is nice as I have both 6V and 12V batteries in my RV
29196,2,"This review is about the seller of these boots, rather than the boots themselves. 11 days ago I placed the order for these boots, never having received a shipment notification... I emailed Motorcycle Superstore for an update. My reply from them came in the form of issuing a credit, no notifications, no explainations. While I am very pleased to have my funds returned for an item that I did not receive... it seems to me that a communication of any sort, be it an out of stock issue or other issues that would prevent the order shipping would be a good business practice."
156173,0,"The dimensions are correct and it is sturdy. However I found out the chrome layer is thin, it started rusting right away. I expected it to take a while for the chrome to wear off, for my use level, about a season. However it started rusting before I even used it. Most hitch balls will rust, it just makes me wonder about their quality control if it rusts so quickly."
67272,1,"I bought this nearly two years ago and it still works great. It covers the entire back seat and then some of my Subaru Forester. The long velcro strips at either end and the and rubberized backing hold it firmly in place -no creeping or shifting whatsoever.The rubber-like back prevents all unpleasant liquids from getting through to the upholstery! Dog hair and dried mud vacuum off easily.Also, the sturdy material and ruberized backing prevent the cover from tearing if you cut it. I put two 3 inch slices in it to fit the seat belts through and there has been no tearing at all at the cut sites.This car seat cover will last forever! I even washed it with no problems.I wish they made them for the front!"
119068,0,"I bought this two years ago and have used it about 10 times. It worked well the first some times. I compared its pressure reading to that of a nice digital gauge, and it's accurate.The automatic shut-off stopped working after 7th or 8th use not sure, which means it will keep inflating even after it reaches the pre-set pressure. The pressure pointer however will stop at the preset reading because it is mechanically stopped such that one time when I did not watch carefully, my tire was inflated to around 60!"
183787,2,"2007 Honda Odyssey in Syracuse, NY. I bought these when they were on sale and I had a rebate which ultimately made them 2-for-1 cost. At full price, I would have been resoundingly disappointed. The driver side wiper never makes complete contact with the windshield at slower speeds. From what I have read in hindsight, this is not uncommon. Would definitely buy the less expensive wiper blades and save the premium price."
128005,2,"I purchased two of these gauges several years ago since the price was attractive. Although they were used very little, both have gone bad. Both gauges now read ""L"" whenever applied to a properly inflated tire. I even, painstakingly, disassembled one of them and replaced the battery; but, that did not help.Judging by the other reviews, my experience was not unusual.By contrast I've owned a Brookstone tire pressure gauge for about 15 years which still works perfectly with the original battery."
47880,1,Exactly the filter needed for my Honda CRV. Have always had excellent form Fram and expect the same from this.
99690,2,"Had this installed for about a year, never worked correctly because it kept flipping to C no matter how many times I'd set the switch to F. About a month ago it started displaying ""LO"" for inside temp. GARBAGE! JUNK! I finally got fed up with this ... device ... and threw it into the garbage. Bought Radio Shack wireless 63-1088 a few days ago and am testing it in the home for possible car use. It is working so far, so if it continues to work properly, I will try it in the car in a week or so and report back. Main issue is the display is rather large for car use, but that can be overcome by mounting it under the GPS bracket."
161802,1,"This steering wheel cover does not work for my nissan maxima. It does not fit!!! The steering wheel is a bit bigger than this wheel cover. Make sure you double check with the size or else you have to return it like I just did. Thus I have to minus 1 star.Other than this issue, the steering wheel is very well-made. The leather feels and looks real. Good quality and definitely awesome if it fits."
10952,0,"I like the shape of the cover, the vent lid opens sufficiently and it passes enough air, however, the cover hinges broke when I lifted it during the installation (they have cracks along the lap that hooks into the slots). I used nylon straps to strengthen the hinges. My rating is based on price and design discounted because it is so fragile."
72747,0,"i don't know what it is about the 95 Camaro's but the dashboards are all cracked or missing. anyways, this did the job of covering it up but it doesn't fit great, it's almost a pink elephant in a... car, lol. but it does the job of covering up the cracks. it's just a bit too big and it doesn't lay flat and it doesn't come with enough Velcro. i bought more Velcro and it still has little humps in it."
134651,1,Works pretty well...I have bought 3 of these so far and they've worked well. I would buy this again if I had to.
163819,2,i chose this tach mainly for it's size and the fine history of Sunpro. I needed a small tach because I planned on installing it on the steering column of my 1970 Mach 1 Mustang and I needed it small enough not to occlude the vison of the speedo and dash gauges. It installed nicely but the tach does not read out accurately and it hangs intermittantly at 4000 rpm sometimes and then falls back when the moter is shut off. I really don't know what the rpm of the engine is as it seem to read about 200-300 rpm lower than the actual rpm.
45177,2,This part came up on a search for a 2006 Mercedes Benz C280. I ordered the part and was very disappointed because it was much to large and had to be returned. I called Gibson Racing directly to order the correct part and they informed me they do not carry any exhaust tips for a MB C280. So don't get your hopes up like I did and purchase this item..it will not fit.
13359,0,"This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately."
16631,1,"With this installed in the 650i Convertible, there is virtually no wind with the 4 side windows up. Even with all windows down, the wind is drastically reduced. I've had the car over 100Mph (on a closed race circuit of course...), and it works really well. Having the back window up doesn't seem to help any further, and if you have tint it makes it harder to see through the rear view mirror (especially because of the black mesh). You will notice a slight breeze coming in from between the driver and passeger seat over the center column, due to the fact there is a small gap in the back center of the top piece (where the screen mounts into the back seat mounting points). Overall, very expensive, but worth it for a night out with your wife('s hair) or a drive on a cool day."
183632,1,Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
97784,0,"I should have read all the other reviews before purchasing. This thing is cool, but small. It has a few bandages, a wrap, scissors and some gauze; but nothing I couldn't have done with an old shave kit and some extra first aid supplies out of the bathroom cabinet. I guess I could use it for a shave kit bag after while- it does have the BMW emblem embossed on it..."
44192,1,These stupid things always break when I try to take the ones out that are already there. Nice thing about these is you can unscrew them to take them out and still just snap them in. And at the price for how many you get......can't beat it.
84186,0,it works well but it does not have as good of a seal as the oem filter
169450,2,"I was very interested on ways to keep my license plate from rattling, sadly this Dynamat 19100 License Plate Kit didn't make the cut. Looking past the absolutely disgusting appearance of the actual license plate, the sound dampening design to quite the license plate is just awful. I'm was not pleased with this purchase, but I guess that's what you get for $10.Bottom Line.. use a different avenue on how to damper your obnoxious rattling license plate."
33382,2,liberally sprayed this on a polyester storm jacket and let dry. a couple of days later wore my jacket in the rain. Nothing! The rain drops soaked in like it jacket was made of Downy paper towels!
109649,2,"Cleaner works very well. Top treatment........not as well as I hoped. Water beads off only with light rain, if it rains all day, or HARD - it really doesn't seem to be any better than when it was untreated. I will try a different brand next time."
51555,2,This item is pretty poor workmanship and doesn't really work very well. Would probably be OK if you just wanted to use it with one car but with two it's very hard to line up. The lasers quit after about 4 days and I returned product for refund. I guess the best thing to use is a tennis ball and a piece of string!!
90313,2,"Is very inconvenient. The top part that is supposed to accept the trash, is not working very well, the bottom part opens up too well for the part that it's supposed to stay closed. I used it for a while, and I figured, it's not as convenient."
80652,2,This filter is too big to fit 2006 Z4 3.0i. Found out after draining the oil :(Ran to the autoparts store and picked up the correct filter (STP brand) which was good because it was well made with good pleats and silicone seals between the ends.
115058,1,These fit my van pretty well. They are attractive and make the car look a lot newer. You can vacuum them pretty easily for spills. I've had a little trouble keeping one of the arm covers on but other than that they are great.
142114,1,"I use this with a solar panel on our camper. It's a great addition. The panel alone would draw down the battery at night because it did not have a blocking diode on it .. this Charger is nothing fancy, but prevents pm drawdown, and overcharging. I would recommend it for camper use. I don't think I would use it for a home setup however."
70948,0,"They're not exactly sturdy - made very thin and light. On the other hand, they're pretty inexpensive, so I guess you can't expect them to be the best quality. All in all they do what they're supposed to do and they look good."
184364,2,"Bought for oil changes and whatnot. Mine actually worked decent most of the time. It did not leak from the side cap like many reviewers said. My problem is that every couple months, while in storage, that side cap would split. Thanks goodness I did not have oil in it. Anyway, I emailed the mfr. (Blitz) from their website. I never heard back in terms of a response but a couple weeks later I got three new caps in the mail. I thought that was nice of them. Unfortunately, it's been a year and all three caps have since split so I threw the thing out. Would not recommend this product."
7975,1,"Bought this set of lights to replace my dimming OEM VW bulbs on a 2007 Rabbit. I can see a marginally increased light output with slightly better distance vision, I have not noticed a significantly wider light pattern. Given the cost of these bulbs I would consider them a great replacement and worth their value. I can not comment on their longevity yet, but going strong so far."
94500,2,"I purchased these ramps to perform service on my cars. Figuring that despite all the negative reviews I could make these work! No such luck. These ramps are worse than useless, they are dangerous! They ended up sliding around on the garage floor, and when I got one wheel up onto one of them it ended with an ominous looking bulge on its sides. They are sitting on the side of the house waiting for trash day to go where they belong!"
61467,0,No noticeable improvements in MPG or power for my truck. I wonder if buying a few cheap replacements would have been a better value for my Nissan Xterra.They are high quality products though built with good quality construction. You can see it easily when compared to the standard paper ones.
161507,2,"I wasted a whole bunch of time trying to get a plug for my Lenovo. When I finally got through to them, they didn't even know Lenovo was a laptop maker. They don't answer eMail, either.I would advise anyone contemplating the purchase of this to buy the plug first and have it in their hand. Their claim of fitting most laptops is borderline false advertizing."
90257,0,Pretty much strictly for looks. It is extremely lightweight and can break easily. Also had to fiddle around with the alignment and headlight to get this to fit correctly.
115527,0,"Just got this and haven't used it yet, but that's mostly because I have to figure out a way to fit this thing into my car! The picture is deceiving because this thing is huge!"
185196,1,"It is a perfect sized bumper sticker. I have had mine of the back of my car for just about a year, and it is still sticking very well. Stays through bad Ohio weather, car washes, and normal wear and tear, and still looks great. Best impulse buy I have ever had. Great for the price."
146905,0,"The air filter here is not a match for 2010 FJ Cruiser, however many store databases say that it is. The FJ Cruiser takes a fully rectangular filter so this will not fit ( I tried)."
77562,0,The Amazon Part Finder indicates this blade fits the 2007 G35 Sport Sedan. In fact it is too long to fit.
62465,0,It says universal but I think it was for 2&#34; pipe. I wasn't sure how you could have a universal muffler clamps but without having a good product description on my walker tail pipe I thought I would give it a shot. I returned it and bought a similar one from orielly's for about the same price.
36831,0,Not as sturdy as I had hoped but it does the job of holding bags and milk cartons etc. A little smaller than expected as well. Ok for the cost.
66963,0,"Recently installed HAWK performance pads to replace the OEM pads on my 2006 Infiniti G35 coupe. Brake system is stock other than the pads (refinished rotors, flushed brake lines, etc.). Pads are great ONCE WARMED UP. When cold they seem to lack the grip that the OEM pads had - softer pedal feel and slight squeaking from time to time. If you tend to drive lots of short distances Hawk performance pads might not be the best set."
4868,2,"I used this a few times and it worked great. It jumped my Volvo quickly. However, after a month the lights that say how much power it has went out. Within 1 1/2 years it wouldn't hold a charge enough to jump a small car."
117052,1,"This Accutire digital gauge is So much better than the ordinary tire pressure device we all use. This is easy to use, gives a very clear and accurate readout and makes testing tires more fun. I keep one in my wifes van and my own car at all times. I even let folks at the gas station use it when I see them using the tire pumps before me."
95621,1,"This is the very common RV vent cap for a variety of uses. These are easy to install, and inexpensive enough to have a couple spare on hand!"
62768,0,"The first one I received did not work properly. I sent it back and it was replaced with no problem, they even had a note in the box that they opened and tested it. Be aware that the alarm is obsolete, the manufacturer stopped making it about 6 years ago. It also goes through a 9-volt battery in about 2 months. But as a cheap deterrent it is fine."
168340,1,Excellent step - completely safe and secure and easy to use. One star deducted because the carrying bag only fits if the step is in it's lowest position. Excellent step!!!
59508,0,These are NOT like factory equipment. A lot of trimming and drilling required for my Taco. Hard to get perfectly straight. You get what you pat for.
81033,0,"There's not a lot written about these products, and I had to search a little bit to be sure these blades would fit my car. I have a 2011 Chevrolet Equinox and this fits my rear window. I wish the product had come with instructions for replacement, it was a big mystery to me."
97375,2,"I got this hub thinking that it would fit my warrior. Because the picture is identical to mine. Apparently this is for a honda and the picture isnt even close. Go by the model number, I hope someone can learn from my mistake."
176909,1,"Not too noticeable on a street bike, but now I have more air and clean air going in. Move tank for install."
110465,1,Clean and as described. No issue with the screws or the nylon nuts. It appeared the nuts were zinc plated... (?)
148550,0,I only bot this cuz of the $7 price. The accuracy given its very large range (10-160) was off. If you need something very accurate this is not it.
59628,0,The filter does a great job of filtering the water and the fact that you can extend the filter's life by using the included cleaning pad I like. The really big downside is the fragile nature of the filter element. I have broken two during transport of my RV. The fact that the elements are not a cheap replacement I will when my next element either breaks or can no longer be cleaned find a more durable alternative!
94120,2,I ordered this downpipe exhaust more then a week ago. The product still hasn't been shipped and promised 19-22. Today is the 19th why even promise a time of delivery.
98632,1,Been looking for this product for quite awhile. Great for securing clasps on jewelery for that extra safety feature. Great product - easy to use and hard to find.
182254,1,"Here is a great helmet for riding on the open road.It has the retro classy look to it and is very comfortable to wear.I bought this helmet in anticipation of purchasing a motorcycle this coming summer.The helmet was well packaged and it came in a scratch free clothbag with a closing drawstring (I thought that was a great idea).I have always liked the half helmets,so when I decided to make plans to buy a motorcycle this was my first and only choice.The visor was very easy to snap on and adjusting the chin strap was a breeze.Shoei really did a great job in doing this helmet retro!The removeable ear protection is nice and well padded.I like the idea that it has a zipper to remove the leather ear protectors as this won't wear out if it were velcro.I opted for the color white as the motorcycle handbook was always mentioning being highy visable to others on the road (what better color,right?).It is well constructed and will last for years to come.I look forward to wearing it as I ride on my new motorcycle on the open road."
75710,2,"Bought one for the moulding on a 1968 Buick GS 350 CA because no one local had the other ones. I will never use it again-ever. You have ZERO leverage to pop the clip loose and must use significant brute force. The two rubber ""feet"" at each end quickly went M.I.A. resulting in metal on glass contact. The plastic molded around the grip broke into three strips (sides and top) and fell off, leaving the squared corners to dig into my hand as I tried to ""jiggle"" it. I would recommend this tool to someone I REALLY hated. If this review stops even one person from making the mistake I did, I will sleep better at night."
52821,2,"Cheap feeling plastic, dont know how it would survive if dropped on a shop concrete floor. Light is bright enough when working properly.Here is the main complaint on this item, the inductive pickup. If you have smaller diameter wires say 6,7 or 8 mm, you will have issues with the inductive pickup not sensing the spark. I have brand new wires(7 mm), brand new cap and rotor, and brand new spark plugs. Tried sliding it in different spots on the wire, same issue random light flash's. Borrowed my buddies timing light made by another company, and it worked like a charm . The inductive pickup is large I assume to accomdate large diameter wires, but with standard size wires there is too much space for it to proper pick up the signal. Tried all kinds of varations of wire placement, etc and same result, random flash's making it not useable.Sending this back, disappointed as the super el cheapo one I had from harbor freight tools worked better then this one."
25451,1,"I'll say, right off the bat, that there aren't any instructions and I didn't look any up. I acknowledge that I may not have used them in the exact way they're meant to be used. I secured a wrap around my muffler using three straps put together. They don't exactly bite down with the strength of a velociraptor but they do cinch down a bit. you almost have to cinch them down and then fold the metal bands over to hold them in place. I haven't had any issues with them yet, so maybe they're doing the job I asked them to do just fine..."
72046,1,"Not much issues were felt without tuning but definitely can feel the bike breathing more. Maybe tuning is next to fully maximize this mod but for something I'll never have to replace and just clean, its great."
59754,1,A must have item for pop up camping. Very well made and lightweight. Would highly recommend.
186808,2,"Bought it so that I can have it in my car. After charging it the first time, it seemed OK. Stored in my car. When I needed to use it (about 3 weeks later), I took it out and it didn't work. I thought it was the battery so I plugged in into the wall. The red LED wouldn't turn on. I left it to charge for a few hours and it still wouldn't work. Waste of money!"
95860,1,Great price and excellent shipping...arrived on time and very happy with the fit/install on my son's Polaris 300. It was easy enough that he helped out. Good times
8110,1,"There was a strip in the middle of the roof of my truck that I just couldn't reach by hand. This stick extends my reach far enough that there is no spot that I can't reach anymore. The pad is nice and soft, I love it."
179278,0,"I bought this because I wanted a pink snow brush. I didnt realize that it states colors may vary. You get a black brush. I kept it anyway and gave it to my husband. It looks like it will be a sturdy brush for the snow. For we have not had snow yet, I cannot comment on how well it holds up."
30868,1,"I have an '08 Polaris Sportsman 800, which by itself is not a slow machine. Once I added this filter as a replacement for the original, however, it was a whole different ballgame. I immediately notice the boost to acceleration and pickup from the motor, and as someone who rides mostly off-road in the desert I'm sure I'm adding longevity to the bike as well. Simple install; fits directly in place of the stock filter. A very inexpensive way to grab a few more horses."
156800,0,We had to replace after one season. We do not leave in an extreme temperature are either. We have very mild winters and very mild summers (guess where that is).It worked well but after several month it started to streak.
8825,0,"I received my ETQ TG32P12 generator on August 17th. I took it out of the box (the sides of the generator are right up against the sides of the box) and immediately noticed one of the rubber motor mounts was torn. I figured no big deal so I put on the feet and then started on the wheels when I noticed that the metal leg that leads to the motor mount on the side with the control panel was broken into 2 parts. I stopped and went in and called Eastern Tools. I received a message (this was during posted service hours) that said "" Hello. Thank you for calling. Goodbye."" I thought I had called a wrong number so I called it again and heard the same message. I then e-mailed Eastern and described the broken parts and asked what I should do at this point. As of this writing I have still not heard from them. After the phone calls to Eastern, I called Amazon and got through to a rep who said he would get back to me within 24 hours about getting a new generator/refund. Well after 24 hours, I contacted Amazon again and they finally replied that they were shipping me a new generator and how to send the broken one back. I received the new generator today, August 20th. I put it together and ran it for about an hour and everything seemed fine. As noted in many other reviews, the oil is difficult to add and it does take slightly less than a quart before overflowing. It ran fine and I powered up a couple of small items with no problem. I had to take the old generator back to a UPS store (about an 8 mile trip) with the return label Amazon sent me but that went fine. I bought this generator after reading many of these reviews but I am now skeptical about it lasting very long after seeing it up close. I would like to thank all of you that have written reviews on this product and will update this when my power goes out and I have to use this generator for real."
3603,1,The HELLA 007424801 Twin Trumpet High/Low Tone 12V Horn Kit with Bracket is feels really solid and well constructed. It sounds very loud and has dual tone. Totally recomended. Thank You...
24057,2,"If this product has the same battery as the Black and Decker VEC157BD, than stay away from it.And is thus equipped with a lead acid battery. Which will die within the first year of usage. I used the VEC157BD only when we are traveling with the RV so thats only 3 to 4 times a year. The battery is already dead and finding a replacement is impossible. And btw replacing the battery is not easy at all and will take some technical experience which is not for everyone.The type of battery is of course totally wrong as that should have been a lithium battery.If you already own one that do not deplete the battery all the way stay above 45% depletion. It might last you more that a year.Anyway total waist of money and a perfect flashlight going to the landfill."
106776,2,"I bought this piaa thinking it's a good horn... wrong!! I shoulda check the horn before I install it . After I bent the bracket to make it fix , go to hit the horn only one work . I test the bad horn , no sound . Can't return it because I bent the bracket . Piaa is junk !!!"
60716,2,"I had to send this back, because the Amazon description is so bad. It fits Dodge Ram 1500 for LATER years, not earlier. Before buying one of these, make sure it fits your truck. I bought this one, read the package, called the manufacturer, and learned that I needed LH-006 rather than this one. Once I got the right one, it worked fine."
110799,1,Unless you have a secondary method of applying this to the air filter (squirt bottle) then don't buy. Purchase the one that comes in the squirt bottle. Good product otherwise. I've used this on my K&N air filter as well as putting the filter back in dry. No noticable difference.
107797,1,The product was as described. There were printed instructions which left much to be desired. The internet has better instructions. Product easy to change and works!
49844,0,I bought these wiper blades for my Corvette. I have purchased many wiper blades in the past and had no problems installing them. These came with no instructions and I could not figure out how to keep them clipped in. They just would not stay. I finally used zip ties to keep them in place. They work fine otherwise.
161979,1,"I can't believe these spark plugs. Even though I have only used the boat twice, the plugs have sparked every time they should have. It is really great to know that you could order (4) spark pugs online and get such good ones. Again, They have sparked everytime they have been called upon (at least I think they have)!"
163681,1,My husband put these mats in my car and was amazed how they fit.....just like they were hand made for the car. They fit great!
126348,1,"This was about $13 cheaper than my local parts place. Arrived in only one day!! I have had great luck with moog joints over the years, and even though they have a lifetime parts and labor warranty, I have never had to take advantage of it. Used these in my VW dune buggy project and have had great luck with them. They don't shear off under stress like cheap brands of joints do. You can't really go wrong with moog, and at this price, its a no brainer."
147026,2,This is a universal part. It actually gives you a package of washers and a printed list and makes you install the one you need by smashing it in with a punch and hammer. Says it will fit a Dodge Ram D250 5.9l but it don't. It usesStandard Motor Products EGR Valve. Now i'm out 3.99 plus return shipping.
184047,0,"Looks like a nice quality lock, but it is not long enough for many of the newer receivers. No specs provided on the shaft length to enable buyers to determine till it arrives. e.g. it is not long enough for Tundra and some Ford receivers.

44996,0,"The item looks nice and is made of quality materials. The 3 holes provide several options, but none were perfect fits on my hitch. It leaves a little gap between the hitch and the flat part of the cover.Fits both 2"" and 1.25"" receivers. Does not come with pin."
146276,0,"It's the little things that define the quality of a product. Having just received the Eton FR400 I can't attest to how well it will work under emergency conditions -- which is, after all, why one buys something like this. But there's a few little things that make me nervous about its quality and design.The plastic strikes me as cheap. How will it stand up to getting knocked around?The case is a textbook case of poor design. It fits the radio so tightly that it turns on switches when you insert the radio -- if you can get the radio into the case. Plus there's no room for the AC charger. This may sound peevish, but it's this kind of poor craftmanship which can be symbolic of a short sighted company. What good is a case if it's a pain to use? What good is it if it turns on features that drain the battery? What good is it if you can't carry accessories that comes with the radio?And the key question, how good is a company that puts out a product so poorly designed? Was Eton trying to cut corners? If so, where else did they scrimp? Did anyone test the case before manufacturing it? If so, what kind of standards do they have?Bottom line: the device has all the features listed here, but their execution makes me wonder if it was worth getting."
36346,2,"The company said they had two items in stock... understandable since they had two packages with the part number on each. The company deals in overstock, closeouts, going out of businesses, etc., so it is also understandable that they have mismarked packages.1st package had all the right paperwork, but wrong connectors.2nd package had different edition of right paperwork, but different wrong connectors.Since they had no more packages with the right part number, they refunded my money.Good company, but know that you are dealing with an autoparts yard sale."

21418,0,"This concept, a laser to assist garage parking, is excellent. The problem here is that these 2 beams come from one source & they cannot be spread far enough apart, even from our high garage ceiling, to contact one's cars in the preferred easily visible location. The solution would be either for the manufacturer to adjust the design to allow a wider spread of the laser beams or for the buyer to purchase 2 single units."

19433,2,Well i purchased this item to protect the bike from the sandstorms and some rain and it really doesn't protect from either of those elements. This is a dust cover for inside use only. Will invest a little more and get one that will at least protect from the rain .

82258,1,Myslef & my friend replaced original transmission oil in our 2003 chevy malibus. Whereas I never had any problem with my transmission he complained that gears in his car weren't working well when cold. This solved his problem. We are satisfied with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for good transmission oil.
143449,0,"I needed a front wheel stand for winter storage and maintenance and this one looked like a good value for the price with double-wheels and rubber fingers for lifting the fork.The good news is it's well built, easy to lift, adjustable and the rubber fingers grab the fork on my 2008 CBR600RR perfectly.The bad news is that it doesn't actually lift the wheel off the ground. Yup, I thought I was crazy, but the ""throw"" on the arm is so little that it momentarily comes just off the ground but then swings back down as the handle touches the floor. It is lifted enough to relieve some of the pressure off the tire, but not enough for the wheel to spin.Since I use it for winter storage and wanted the stand off the ground anyway (to avoid any pooling water in my garage during the winter from snow melt) my work-around was to place both sets of stand wheels under two lengths of 2x4, which lifts the front wheel almost 2 inches.I don't know if my (stock) bike is an exception but I wouldn't think so; if the limitation described above is okay with you then its a good value for a well built stand, otherwise keep looking."
179722,1,"I have a 2002 pt cruiser and my headlights were all milky and not very bright, so I thought I'd buy these and my brother-in-law could install them for me. The product was great! Nice clear lenses, bright bulbs, and it fit like it was supposed to, BUT... this is in no way easy to install. In order to replace the headlights on pt cruisers you have to remove the tires, remove the front finders, remove the entire front bumper, AND take off the grill. So unless you know someone who has lots of tools, jacks, experience with body work, and time on their hands, don't get these thinking you do this yourself. I felt so sorry for putting this on my brother in law, but he did it for me in a few hours. To make things worse, my bolts holding the bumper on were rusted and kept breaking, so he had to saw some of them off. With all that being said, I can see so much better at night and the lights have performed great so far!"
1534,1,"It works as advertised but it has two major drawbacks: lack of any meaningful owner's manual and an extremely annoying beep that it makes everytime that backup power is used. Since there is no owner's manual, I can't figure out how to disable this beep or if it can be disabled at all. This basically provides a few minutes of emergency backup so that you can safely turn off your devices in the event of a blackout or similar problems. But the beeps make it impossible to use the backup power for too long."
120982,0,I tried using it in my 4Runner but it did not fit my drain plug because I have kinda widen the hole.
11606,1,PRO: Great product. Charged my custom chopper's battery and keeps it stable. The bike cranks up with full power when i start it. I like the fact that it comes with the alligator clips and also the fixed terminals that you can permanently attach to the battery terminals. The fixed attachment terminal makes it very convinient so that after you ride you can just reconnect to main charger with out any hassle of taking off the seat. I just keep the connector tucked in under the seat. FYI the connector terminal that you are leaving exposed (...or tucked in the seat) has a molded cap so that there is no way of shorting the battery out.CON: It should be water proof. I think there is a waterproof version...if there is why bother with this model.
23472,2,according to the item description it says: Each package contains six seat belt shoulder pads .... i only got one seat belt pad.... i havn't contacted the seller but if the issue gets resolved then i will add to this review later.
130347,0,"These wipers have a rubber 'spoiler' on the back that I'm sure is designed to push down against the windshield with wind. the issue is that it also effectively functions as a shovel for snow and ice. These wipers 'freeze' up much faster than the cheaper pair i had on the truck. It's pretty bad in wintery conditions. When there's no snow they are pretty good at clearing the windshield. The passengers' side wiper does leave the windshield at the bottom of the rotation about 2 inches before the end of the wiper, presumably due to the curve of the windshield. I've had others in the past that did that, so it's not uncommon, but I was hopeful these would do better.For rainy conditions, they've performed very well. I'll keep these in mind as a summer time wiper, but they've gotta come off before it gets too cold."
4401,1,"Small, inconspicuous. My vehicle stays litter free. I just dump it at a gas station trash bin when I fill up."
103079,1,"I like this wind shield. It is just large enough to take the majority of the wind-blast off of your chest increasing ride endurance. It does not affect your temperature at all like a larger shield so it's not for those looking to keep warmer. It also will not help against bugs.I do recommend this windshield, provided people understand that it's not a full height windshield."
129242,1,"I have had the Q-tower system for a number of years, through three different vehicles. All in all a great rack system, except for two items: The cost of the little parts that you need to convert from one vehicle to the other are stratospheric! I really don't mind Yakima making their money on the big ticket items such as towers, boxes, etc. but the little adapter items should be priced more fairly. It seems to me that once you are locked into a Yakima system they fully intend to hose you on the little things. Too bad. Further, the Yakima website is a mess to try and find the specific little items and accessories that they intend on hosing you with!"
25396,1,Love this buy. Nice quality short ram intake fits perfect. Low cost parts with a great sound and function. Does what it is supposed to do.
161361,2,I cannot review this product as I never received it. They kept sending me AF1160 air filter instead of FF1160 fuel filter.
30335,2,"I bought this so I could siphon some automatic transmission fluid out of the dipstick entry under my hood. Squeezing the ball and putting the tube inside the liquid, pulled the ATF about halfway up the long end of the tube. I was unable to build up enough pressure to pull the liquid any further along and certainly not enough to get a flow going."

80074,1,I used this as a replacement spark plug for my 1977 Honda XL75. It fit perfectly and the bike runs just fine.
22317,2,"Where should I begin? Hmm...how about...don't buy this item. I got this item because when I got my car (a '97 Acura Integra GS-R)there was no shift knob and I didn't really know much about them so I browsed around and decided to get this one since it had a good price. What a waste of money.First, this is a universal-fit shift knob, which means there is no thread to put onto your shifter. It came with a few plastic covers that go on top of the shifter and fit the hole under the knob. none of the covers was an exact fit to width of the shifter so I had to use duct tape to get a tight grip. The knob then has 3 hex screws that are supposed to keep it in place. This would probably work out if I didn't actually use my car and had it for presentation. After driving around for a few weeks the knob started to get loose. As I would shift, the knob itself would turn. Eventually, the hex screws would wear down the plastic cover and there was no more grip. C H E A PSecond, the handle itself isn't very sturdy. I don't drive crazy but from time to time I like to drive my GS-R how it was meant to. One day I was shifting from first to second and as I pulled toward me the black part on the knob separated from the silver part. It didn't completely come off but it stayed loose ever since. I put super glue but even that can't hold it very well.Overall, 1 star rating for such cheap quality. If you want a new shift knob for your hooptie, make sure to get a threaded one that fits your car. I had this same problem with another universal knob I bought after."
21556,1,"I looked around before I ordered mud guards. It was raining almost every day and living on a dirt road didn't help. I had to clean my Hummer H3 all the time because mud would be all the way up to the windows. When I read the other review that said these were wide I thought I would try them. My tires are wide and I wanted something to cover good. My husband put them on in no time at all and he said they went on easy. Then I waited and it didn't rain for a couple of weeks. Well, finally it rained and I went out just to try the mud guards. I am very excited to say I no longer have mud all over the side of my white Hummer. I'm not sure why they would make a Hummer without these already installed. They look great, like factory made. Shipping was so fast... Love them!!!"
25324,2,"Products were shipped in a timely fashion. They were NOT as advertised. Only one of them was NEW. The other, though it worked, was clearly used, with definitive signs of exposure to an exhaust stream.

Now it is more than a week later and I still haven't received my package, or an email saying when it will become available. I could have bought this item from somewhere else and had it by now. I will never order from them again."
16907,0,"My pump had been squeaking but was functional. Just a little annoying. Bought the pump which does not come with a pulley which was fine because mine was in great shape. You will need a pulley which can be purchased from your local parts store because your pulley cannot be removed without destroying it. New pulley pressed on with the included hardware. New pump no longer squeaks but once in a while it is hard to steer as if it is fighting your input. Not that easy to change on a 2000 Olds Silhouette so I will deal with the hard steer instead of sending it back and waiting for a replacement. If my wife were driving the van I would buy another and try again. Bottom line if you buy the pump, be prepared to buy a pulley."
74415,0,"The minute I opened this PackRight, I knew I would not be fond of it. Why? Because it opens towards the rear of the car. I knew that, but thought there would be a zipper or something that goes along the side to help with packing. Instructions say to load the carrier while it's on the roof. Unless your supplies are light, that's the only way to do it. With the opening facing backwards, it's very awkward to load. We tried it that way but gave up. Since we only had pillows, blankets, clothing and sleeping bags in there, my husband loaded it on he ground and threw it onto the roof.There is no zipper for closing. Roll it up like a potato chip bag and secure with a buckle. I'd feel better if they added a zipper to it.Went on the trip and everything held together. My husband was nervous it would all fly off the roof, but that did not happen.So . . . it works, but is very awkward to load."

They really seem to capture a lot of dirt without obstructing airflow.

The inverter failed to invert on the first opportunity for it to do what it is made to do. So I asked for a replacement given infant failure. Was told that ""We are sorry to hear that the unit was damaged due to Hurricane Irene. Please see the warranty policy indicated on the invoice included on the order.

133587,0,"I found the application to be tedious. It goes on streaky and dries that way too, even if you keep the applicator soaked. needed a minimum of three coast to look fairly even. A sealer / protectant on top of it makes a big difference on the shine and appearance. After it dries I thought that the trim looks as if it was painted, not the natural finish you'd expect. I only did the areas that desperately need it to be re-dyed. If your surface can use one of those temporary coatings that last a few months, that's the way I would go, then you know you can recoat it or use something else when you need to do it again. I taped the painted areas next to the trim to avoid over runs, it was a good idea but not really necessary, the dye wipes off clean when it is still wet and, with a little extra work, after it dries. it is absolutely necessary to clean the surface BEFORE you apply the dye and the stuff that comes with it works just fine.

I reached back and dropped the wind deflector and my wife's hair was blowing straight forward, pulled the deflector back up and no more wind. I have tested it at very fast speeds and you just feel a little breeze on the top of your head. I really enjoy having the top down when it is in the low 50's with the heat on. The wind deflector keeps the heat in the cockpit. I bet it will be the same on hot days and will keep the cool air conditioned air in the car.Great company, quick to ship and it is exactly as described. Buy it without hesitation!."
154747,2,"I don't understand what everyone thinks is so great about these wipers. I had a set of these on for approx. 3 months and they were basically shot. Right out of the package they left streaks that previous cheapy blades never did. I though maybe they'd break in or something but nope. I cleaned the windshield thoroughly, wiped down the blades with IPA and still they never actually cleaned the windshield that well. I even ran Rain-X with them and it didn't really help. For the price these things should work flawlessly and last a long time but they don't. I'll never purchase these blades again, ever. I wouldn't put them on if they were free knowing I'd just have to change them out in 3 months when they were worn out. The cheapy blades give me a year plus usually here in PA. Right now I'm running the Rain-X brand wipers and Rain-X wiper fluid. They work awesome together and it saves me from having to coat the windshield with the Rain-X treatment. So far these have been on 5 months and still working great at roughly 2/3 the cost of the Bosch, it's a no brainer for me."

12516,1,"I debated between this and some cheaper knock-offs but finally decided to go with the Battery Tender. I have no regrets about my decision. I don't use my car (97, Accord) to drive much anymore and the (2 month old) battery seemed to always be dead when I did need the car which happens when you don't drive and your car sits in Florida sun.I connected up the terminal adapter that came with the product to my car battery and left the connector hanging out from under the hood. I then plugged the Battery Tender to an outlet in the garage, connected an extension cable (which I additionally purchased) between the Battery Tender and the adapter attached to my car battery. My car battery was initially dead but after 2 days I checked the Battery Tender and said that it was now in float and the battery should be good to go. I disconnected the Battery Tender and the car started right up.The Battery Tender works as designed and comes as a compact sturdy unit. For me this was a small price to pay to have piece of mind that my car will always start when I need it to.Excellent product."
100708,1,Wiper blade arrived within 48 hours. Fits perfectly on our JEEP Grand Cherokee 2000. Easy to install. Looks like original equipment.
48286,2,"I bought this steering stabilizer for my 1992 F350. Even though this product is the correct part (according to Skyjacker) for my truck, once reading the instructions, I quickly realized that my truck was an after thought. Skyjacker bills this kit as a ""universal"" kit. I guess as long as welding is involved, any kit is universal? Reading the instructions, Step #2: you are told to bolt the bracket to the frame using the supplied u-bolt, but that the u-bolt won't work on 1992-96 F350's and that either drilling holes in the frame or welding will be required. Once you are finished with Step #7, you are told that if you are installing this on a truck with 6"" or greater lift, you must weld the bracket even lower than Step #2 states. So, if you've already welded it to the frame like Step #2 instructs you and you have 6"" or more lift on the truck, you are gonna be pretty pissed by the time you read what comes after Step #7.Since I have a 6"" lift kit on the truck, I went ahead and cleaned off my frame rail and c-clamped the bracket to the frame for fitting. Once it was in the correct position and ready to weld I noticed something else wrong. When the bracket is welded to the frame, there is not enough space between the bracket and the passenger side leaf spring. It looks good when it is clamped up (or welded), but once you install the stabilizers and their bushings, you realize that the threaded shafts of the stabilizers will contact the leaf spring at the slightest bump. And this is on a truck with 6"" lift. The threaded shafts are even closer to the leaf spring when no lift is installed on the truck. Very poor design all the way around. Even when mounted as instructed, the angles of the stabilizers are very bad.If you have coil springs on your truck (F150's and Bronco's) you shouldn't have the problem I've just described. But if you have a 1992-96 F350, get ready for some fun. You are better off just getting the stabilizers and fabbing up your own mounts or just getting a single steering stabilizer kit and mounting it up in the stock location.Oh yeah, if you really want to have some fun, give Skyjacker's customer support a call. They act like you are the first person to ever have a problem. Call multiple times, you'll get the same reaction each time you call.Regardless, search the net for images of any Ford with leaf springs and a Skyjacker dual steering stabilizer correctly installed. You won't find any for a reason. The kit is junk!"
164205,2,"I bought this unit in order to have emergency power for my C-PAP breathing machine. Upon examination the 110 volt power receptacles did not work. The compressor, 12 volt power, light, and jumper cables worked just fine.During a recent summer storm we lost power and I could not sleep. VERY annoying. Very disappointing."
108675,1,I got this to replace the shift knob on my new Jeep Patriot. I like the look. It is nice and smooth and fits in your hand well. I haven't gotten around to installing it yet so I don't know how easy that is. But it doesn't look like it will be very hard.
141597,1,This is a wonderful scraper to have. It does a great job on frost and I would recommend this to anyone that has to scrape frost!
116885,1,"I have been having an issue with my truck over the past couple weeks, on cold days it would show that I had a low tire. My truck isn't high tech enough to tell me which tire. I ordered this item, opened the package and tested it out on each of my tires. I found I had over inflated one of the tires greatly, and easily found which tire was too low. The test literally takes 2 seconds to measure the tire pressure, and fits securely on the the nozzle. I had no issue using this, and would highly recommend this product. There was no air escaping, and made a nice tight seal, very easily. When I went to Quik Trip, for the free air, I was able to hold the air hose in one hand, while I would test the PSI in my tire with the other hand. Very simple!!!!"
95081,0,"Installed the hitch yesterday on my 99 Grand Caravan. Only had to drill a couple of holes, not actually that bad. The install went fairly smoothly after I removed the two bolts that I broke (my van's not the hitch's)... :S However, when I went to torque the knurl-neck bolts that actually hang the hitch on the brackets, 4 of the 6 of them stripped before I was even close to 90lbs as is in the specs. Had to go pickup a slew of new hardware to actually mount the thing.On my caravan it hangs a little low, not Reese's fault, I think the leafs are sagging a bit. Aside from the crappy bolts to attach it to the brackets it's great and would have otherwise given it a 5 star, but that added about two hours to the '30 min' install time since I had to grind the stupid things out and then find new ones."
70645,0,It would be a great thing if you could consider incorporating with this product a charger. Reason; the item would be good for telephoning equipment in the rural areas through the use of solar panel to charge the battery for its use. Presently there are hundeds of thousands of people in the rural areas that these item could serve if the charger is built with all the Xantrex Portawattz inverters. As one of thier distrubutors in Africa I for see a large market for it.
109272,0,The wiper is only getting 3 stars based on its fit on our minivan. I bought it based on other mentions and I ended up needing to remove the blade from the frame and install it back on the old blade frame. Performance is ok based on the modified install needed.
94687,1,This made the removal of my inner tie rods very easy. I have had issues in the past and wish I had this tool. I will use it only few times in my life but it was worth it.

149422,2,The seat covers started coming loose at the seams immediately upon putting them on the seats.
18747,2,"I bought this and tried to use it. My evaluation is as follows:- The product manual says ""Big enough to wash a shirt, slacks, shorts and a pair of socks in one load"". Please be aware that the motor is not powerful enough, and adults' jeans, trousers may NOT be washed. (Try to visualize by the example of a cheapo mixer-grinder, whose motor is trying to overcome the drag of the large pieces of fruit/vegetable!) Although the bucket was NOT overloaded, the motor could not rotate these clothes, and was whining unsuccessfully. The load just reamined soaked for 15 minutes.- It works satisfactorily for lighter and/or much smaller pieces of clothes. e.g. undergarments, socks, etc. I think, it would be good for baby/child clothes. It is not that suitable for adult's clothes.- This portable washer will take roughly one-fifth to one-fourth (and that using smaller pieces of clothes) of the load used in regular top-load washers to ""wash"" your clothes satisfactorily.- It may be used as a supplement to the full-size washers. It should not be expected to serve as a replacement for the fullsize washers, even for usual weekly washing needs for adults' garments.- Given the above limitations, will it be good for your need? You decide. It did not fit well for my need. Thanks."
41790,1,got this to replace the smaller one that came with my windshield works just as should was easy to in install

12567,2,"If you really need small ice cube trays these will be fine. I bought 4 (2 sets) and found that they really didn't stack well when there were 4 of them. The design of the little tab that lets them stack is pretty poor -- if the tray is curved slightly then the tray won't stack right and the cubes below will be touching the plastic above and the whole stack will be lopsided. 2 of the trays I bought were curved so much that they wouldn't stack properly at all (even when full). The seller offered to replace them if I returned them, but for $3 what's the point of spending $5 to get new ones? I think I'll buy some bar supply trays instead. On the plus side, the cubes pop out really nicely."

I put this on it for a couple days and now the battery is good.I'm not sure how much longer trhe battery will last, but, the Battery Tender saved this one for a while when no others could.What ever this unit does, I don't know. It pulses the battery or something.5 Stars for this product."
178141,0,"This may be a BakFlip product but it comes labeled, boxed and logoed as a ""Ford Custom Accessory"". It is also a 4 panel cover not the 3 panel that is shown in the picture. Installation was simple enough but one might want to watch the video on BakFlips site for a good overview. I had to remove the diamond plate bed rails that were on the truck to fit the cover properly. If you have aftermarket bedrails you may have to do the same. It also came with a thoroughly squashed and deformed piece of foam tape that only said to use on bed rail if you don't have a bed liner. It was too damaged to use so I guess I'll be making a trip to the hardwar store for an equivalent replacement. All in all seems like a good product but I can't give it more than 3 stars because of the Ford label and the 4 vs. 3 panel situation. Perhaps after I've used it for awhile I'll update the review."

84665,0,"These are supposed to fit a standard 2x, but they're a tad (maybe 1/8"" - 1/4"") too narrow to accept such a board. Not all 2x's are the same thickness though due to drying/shrinkage, so maybe my local HD just happened to have ""thick"" boards. I guess I could've notched the boards, but instead I used a sledge hammer and smashed the ends of the boards to bevel them. Then I was able to force these ramp ends on.Aside from that, these work well. The supplied bolts fit like a glove. These are quite sturdy and I'd guess the boards I'm using will give out before these ramp tops will."

Also, the box containing the Fel-Pro gasket is marked with this message, ""NOT RETURNABLE IF OPENED"". So if you order this for an Accord DX or LX and then open it and find out that it doesn't fit your valve cover, you are stuck with it; which is what happened to me."

182028,0,"I was looking for a back-up alarm for my E250 so I bought this based on the other reviews that said it was loud, it is not. Yes it does make a beep beep sound but not the beep beep sound I am looking for. I wanted more of a beep beep you hear on commercial vans/ trucks. This thing sounds like a sim-loud alarm clock taped to the back of my van. The only reason I gave it 3 star instead of 1 star is because it does beep and when it comes to safety a low beep is better than no beep.Edit: I have remove this alarm and installWolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm, Loud 97 Decibel - 12-24 Volt.

34032,0,"I bought this to get some warmth in freezing winter this year on the East coast. It does what it says but has a couple of things which I feel are not up to the mark.1. It doesn't really heat up quickly as others have indicated in their reviews. Mine takes more than 2-3 minutes to even feel warm (is it the extreme cold weather I don't know but I definitely feel could have been better).2. You can't find a good way to fasten it to your car seat. It does provide a back strap and a couple of side ones so you can attach to something under your seat etc but its still not easy to manage.All in all, I don't dislike it since it eventually is better than not having anything in this cold. Plus the cushion kind of makes me feel good sitting in the seat as opposed to no cushion."
1726,2,"On the first of these units I ordered, the display for the clock/radio unit didn't work. I returned it and Amazon sent me another one. On the second unit I received, the power meter was broken. It would display 0 watts no matter what was plugged into the inverter. The display function button also wouldn't toggle the display, so the battery charge % never showed. I am currently waiting for my third unit to arrive.Why did Amazon even start selling this lousy product? The quality control over at Xantrex is clearly dismal, if not nonexistant. One bad product I can believe was a slip-up, but two in a row suggests that their manufacturing process needs to be reexamined.Save yourself a headache and buy a power pack from a different manufacturer."

188462,1,"I've used full sized automatic center punches as window breakers, during my emergency response days. This is an excellent fill-in unit. It attaches to your keychain, and is a sort of pull-apart unit, so that you have easy and instant access to the thing if you need it.The window breaker will only work on the side or rear windows, the front windshields of American cars are laminate tempered glass that have a sheet of plastic between the layers. This won't break that. But the side or rear glass, no problem. Just push the flat end of the breaker against the glass, you'll hear a little ""pop"" and the window breaks into thousands of tiny glass crumbs.As far as the seat belt cutter, it seems sharp enough, although I don't want to test it and possibly dull the blade. Seems like it'll do the job nicely if called on.Of course this thing is not a cure-all. You need to have a plan in the back of your head. Watch the TV show ""Mythbusters"" and look for the submerged car episode to see what I mean. Trying to figure out how to use this while your car is filling up with water and you and your passengers are panicking is not the time to be reading instructions or formulating an escape plan.This item, which is much smaller than those ""Escape"" hammers you can also buy, is very cheap insurance. The advantage over the hammers is that you don't have to swing this to make it work, just press it against a window and you're out.I got one for every member of my family, including the non-drivers. No telling if you'll be a passenger in someone else's car when the need for this thing arises."

143525,0,"I first installed these on my 2008 Mitsubishi Galant ES (DRLs use the low-beams) before a long road trip up to Maine back in August 2008. Here it is now February 2009 and one bulb died already. Since then I put about 10,000 miles on the car.They started out very bright and white at first and worked great on the dark back roads. Over the course of time, I noticed that they seemed to be getting dimmer and dimmer. I figured my lens was dirty so I would constantly clean it. It turns out that they were actually dimming.So I installed the OEM Sylvania bulb where the one SilverStar Ultra burnt out to find that it's actually brighter! The only downfall is that it's yellow. I will try to post a picture of the two lights in comparison to give you an idea.I probably would not buy these bulbs again but try the PIAA Xtreme White Plus. I might consider the standard SilverStars again as they lasted well over 3 years in my 2000 Saturn SL2."
5725,1,"This is an outstanding quality, original equipment spark plug that will give new life to your small gasoline motor. This one in particular went into my Honda GX200 motor attached to a pressure washer. I noticed an immediate improvement in smoothness and starting after installation. I've never had any quality issues with any NGK plug I've used over the years - quality is top notch. Be sure to size the gap to your particular application, however, as the factory gap is not universal to all motors. (unlike some modern automotive plugs that are pre-gapped to a specific distance and are not meant to be adjusted)While it is convenient to get this item by mail, the value is dependent on cost and availability from local retailers. Therefore, weigh the current cost of this plug against the time and mileage you'd spend getting this for less at a local store.It is easy to recommend this high quality, long lasting plug for your your next small motor tune up."

75416,2,"Ordered 6 spark plugs. Amazon turned it into 3 shipments of 2 each. Received three shipments and 8 plugs plugs when filling the order. As most competent car folks know come in boxes of 4. In one of the packages was a four-pack. Unfortunately it was a four pack of four USED Denso plugs, not new Autolite plugs. Obviously some low life returned used plugs and Amazon didn't bother to check them before restocking them.If that was frustrating enough, dealing with the trying to return them has been difficult at best. Sent back the four used plugs in the single box. The clerk at the return center only credited me for one plug and not four (most likely the same one who restocks used plugs). Overall the experience has been frustrating. I shop and spent hundred on Amazon each year and am usually very satisfied. Thought I'd save some time and order plugs on line. Wrong. Waste of time and money. Don't buy car part from Amazon. Support your local Pep Boys, AutoZone, O'Reilly's or Mom and Pop Auto Supply shop. You'll help the local economy and deal with people who the difference between new and used and the difference between one spark plug and a box of four."

The cups lose their suction quickly, or come loose with the slightest breeze. I'm not sure if this problem is due to the embedded heating elements in the rear window that don't allow for good suction or if it's just not a good quality product. If anyone has found a way to make the shade stick, I'd be interested in hearing the solution. It is also too wide (from top to bottom) and doesn't stretch taut. I tuck it into the back seat as far as I can, but it just doesn't seem to be a good fit. It does provide adequate sun protection, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have a Honda Civic sedan."

I was advised to use a slatted platform for a foam mattress. I could REALLY feel the slats when sitting, so I added a solid platform. That helped, but I can still feel it if I sit in one spot in bed for hours (writing, grading, watching movies, etc). That said, for my small budget, this still the best choice."
145503,1,"The manufacturer makes it clear that this kit is NOT intended for use with suede. I bought it anyway, figuring what the heck, it's worth a try when the alternative was to throw away my torn suede jacket or pay a lot for a professional repair, and maybe I'll need it for something else down the road. Well, I just tried and am absolutely delighted with the results. It was really easy to use and no one is going to notice the repair."

Since these are made in the peoples republic of China, I will be returning this item and searching for trailer hitch balls from another company."

31916,0,"These shoes look adorable, but they're inexpensive and it shows. I bought mine in white patent and I'm satisfied considering the price. I think I'll be wearing them on Halloween or other special occasions that call for fun dress up. They're not hard to walk in, the heel is high but it's stable and the platform is high enough so that it's pretty easy if you're used to walking in heels at all. I wear a size 9 reliably but I've bought Pleaser shoes before and they run small so I ordered a 10. My feet were swimming in them. I returned them (thanks for making it so easy Amazon!) and ordered my 9 and they're a little tight in the toes, but not bad. Overall great dress up fun, but the quality is not great."

Sorting out the codes isn't too bad for anyone with some basic automotive knowledge and Internet access to research the readings. The scanner itself uses simple menus to pull and delete codes and will read sensor output (timing, coolant temperature and much more) in real time. I found the included CDROM to be basically useless because of minimal code descriptions. An Internet search engine will find the answers in detail."

19830,1,"I installed these window visors on a 1993 Ford F250 & they fit perfectly.Previously the truck had a cracked/faded/old pair of a different brand name installed & they looked horrible....in addition to looking bad, they were very wide & the front triangle windows would not open on either door due to the visor hitting the glass upon movement. I removed the old visors & old double sided tape, cleaned the surface, and then installed the new Auto Ventshade 92068 on the doors. PERFECT FIT! And, the best part is that these are not nearly as wide & my triangle windows will open fully with no contact with these!Very easy to install & they look great.*** Tips on installation ***- If removing old visors & old tape, keep in mind that the old tape will basically be as hard as chewing gum on the bottom of a middle school lunchroom table.....almost impossible to remove without scratching your paint. It removes much easier when hot, so either park in the sun or use a blow drier on it. Also, to remove it use PLASTIC!! Do not use metal (it will scratch your paint). I found the easiest way to remove the old tape was to heat it up, scrape it off with a 20 oz drink cap, then (while wearing gloves) use isopropyl alcohol with a rag to rub the remaining glue off.- Clean the surface with a streak-free glass/window cleaner. Dont use the included joke of a ""cleaning pad"" that is nothing more than a wet-wipe from a fast food joint.- Line the visor up BEFORE removing the adhesive tape film. If you cant eyeball it easily, take to blue painters tape & make a template on the door so you can line it up 100% correctly. Keep in mind that you only get one shot at this....the tape is EXTREMELY sticky & you will bend your new visor if you try and reposition it once it sticks to the paint.Good Luck!Woodstockva"

157939,1,"The Mr. Clean Auto Dry wash system is the perfect product for those who prefer washing their cars manually instead of going to the car wash, but don't want to spend hours doing it a more traditional way with a bucket of soapy water and a mountain of towels.However, there are a couple things to note when using this. Firstly, you WILL have to go over your car with a sponge after applying the soap. Since dirt is hydrophobic, if you don't go over it with a sponge, the soap and water will just run off of the car. But a quick rub with a sponge is all it takes. Secondly, when using the drying stage, you need to hold the unit pretty close to your car and go over it slowly. Otherwise it won't dry completely and there will be water spots.All in all, if you do want to manually wash your car, this is the unit to have. If you simply go over your car with a sponge and be a little patient with the drying process, you won't be disappointed."

147454,1,"I love how this is designed: simple & plenty of adjustability. I used to have another Reese mount with 2"" drop that I used plenty of times to tow various utility trailers. I recently got an enclosed trailer that rode really low. With my other mount, the trailer constantly towed at an angle on a flat road. With this, it now rides level, and I can use it for many other types of trailers. If there was one thing to tweak on this design to make it better, I would add the one-tool bolt-on/bolt-off feature like my other Reese mount. You'll need two large wrenches to bolt on a tow ball on this design. Also, you'll need two locking hitch pins with this design if you want to secure your trailer. Luckily, I already had a second hitch pin."
89147,0,I bought this because it's a reasonable price for neoprene seat covers. When they came in I really liked their feel and they were easy to install.

163759,0,"This product works very well to hold the toll transponder in place. It sticks well but does occasionally slip off the windshield. I don't expect it to stay on all the time. I like to place it at the bottom of the windshield right over the steering wheel. It does not obstruct the visibility and if it slips, it tend to stay put. One issue though is the failure of the plastic holes that hold the rubber suction cups. With the South Florida heat and sun, it tends to melt the plastic and the thin part tends to break off (and i""m usually parked inside a garage). Mine usually lasts about a year so it's not too much of a problem. I bought two."

Within the year all taped joint started to come off (still cosmetic). I returned it to the place of purchase and it was replaced. The new one did exactly the same thing within a few months. They refused to replace it again. I have lived with it until a year ago and I then noticed the black vinyl which covers each panel had cracked in numerous places. I have attempted to re glue this with little success. A $1000 cover is now garbage! BUYER BEWARE !!!

114948,2,"Years ago we purchased and used the Wood Bead Car Seat Cushion. We used it for several years. My husband has never been happy with any cushions since it feel apart and we had to take it out of the vehicle. With internet, I finally went on line and purchased 2 of these for my husband. I paid over $25.00 a piece. When we put one in the car there were very little ties on it to anchor it down. I knew with it moving around it would wear out faster. I added additional ties to hold it down. In no time at all, the beads were starting to come apart in the seat. I pulled on a piece of plastic the beads were strung with and it broke immediately. I could tell the plastic holding the beads together was old and not from wear but age. I immediately went through and pulled additional nylon high test wire to keep it together. The seat cushion continued to fall apart where I had not put additional wire. The seat completely feel apart where the beads were falling out of the vehicle upon sitting on it. I finally took the cushion out of the vehicle. I am afraid to put the 2nd one in. Does anyone have any suggestion as to what I can use and how I can retie the 2nd one with so that it will last for at least 2 or 3 years like the original one from years ago did? I would be ever so greatful."

The very first time I used them there was a constant squeaking sound similar to the sound wet shoes make on a hard surface; extremely distracting and annoying! A closer inspection revealed that the passenger side wiper was hovering over the windshield almost a 1/2 inch because the wiper wasn't conforming to the contour of the windshield. I tried manipulating the wiper to make it fit better with no luck. After a couple weeks I replace these wipers with Rain-X wipers, which is the brand I had before. I'll definitely be sticking with those in the future."

45244,2,"This HVAC blower motor does NOT properly fit a 1994 Infiniti Q45. (1) The motor comes with bare wires, not the male Molex jack that is mounted directly to the side of the OEM motor. You'll need to attach male spade lugs to the wires to plug into the existing female Molex comnnector on your car, and tape or heat shrink the wires to the connector so they don't work loose over time. Or you can find a matching male Molex connector to attach to the blower motor wires (not easy to figure out -- Molex makes 100s of connectors), or cut off the existing female Molex connector on the car's wiring harness and splice the wires to the motor wires. (2) The OEM blower motor, when mounted on the HVAC evaporator housing, has an opening on its left side to receive a ventilation hose that runs from the evaporator housing to the motor to provide cooling to the blower motor. This Four Seasons replacement motor also has an opening for the ventilation hose, but it's located at the wrong place on the blower motor. When the replacement blower motor is mounted with three screws to the evaporator housing (on the firewall behind the glovebox) in the only orientation in which the screws match up, the ventilator opening in the blower motor casing faces to the right and you can't attach the ventilation hose.The alternate VDO-brand replacement blower motorVDO PM2721 Blower Motorappears identical to the Four Seasons motor, and has the same problems. I could pretty easily have attached spade lugs as an electrical connector, but I wasn't up for fabricating a new ventilation hose. So I bit the bullet and ordered an OEM blower motor at 4X the non-OEM replacement cost and it works fine. A used OEM motor I ordered on E-Bay was graded ""A"" quality, but the motor brushes were 95% worn and wouldn't have lasted more than a year."

104924,2,"I received this yesterday and it certainly doesn't look like the main photo above, as others have mentioned. I had expected that, and tried it on a few short car trips, hoping it would be very soft and conforming. While the middle portion is softer, that leaves the firmer front edge pressing into the underside of your thighs. The cushion didn't seem to really conform or be gel-like, so I don't think it is likely to ever look like the manufacturer's photo.In order to understand how it was made, I unzipped the outer cover. You can see this on the photos I've uploaded above. There is an inner knit bag containing a foam rubber cushion with a recess in the middle where a soft rubber mesh is glued. No way does the soft rubber mesh meet my definition of ""gel."" It does allow your rear end to sink down into the cushion, but they could just as easily have contoured the foam rubber or used softer foam rubber. Using a ""memory foam"" would probably be the best, but that isn't what this is.Because I haven't found anything better, I actually cut open the knit bag and cut/tore the foam away from the front edge to taper it and hopefully eliminate the pressure on my thighs. Haven't tried it yet, but if it works much better, I'll add to this review."
54685,0,"The product pretty much does as it claims. I got it mainly for the glass wipes, and I wish the container was bigger (for some reason I thought it was bigger when I ordered it). But the wipes are good - they clean the windows well, although I do wipe them down after with a papertowel to remove any residue. The interior wipes are good - the cleaning ones work well on all surfaces. Not sure that the protectant ones are all that useful, but I guess we will see over time if they help."
60706,0,"I purchased this product and thought all was well. It feels comparable to OEM handle, but for less than 20 bucks I didn't expect a lot.Installation went well no problems, actually really simple. Used it for a while then went to open my tailgate one day and the whole handle assembly broke off leaving the bolts in the tailgate. I spoke with amazon and they sent me another one out no problems. Installed that one and have had no problems the last few months.The one thing that bugs me is that it does not sit flush against the tailgate. If you look at it there is an apparent gap which while pulling on the handle gets larger. If that does not bother you then you should be in good shape. Just take a easy while opening the tail gate and it should have a long service life.Overall a good affordable product which does what it is advertised to do."

The price is fantastic.I'll update on durability later.UPDATE 6/4/12: With my car parked outside and after a couple long trips still looking great and solid.

Unfortunately, the same thing has happened to the same blade twice more since.

16074,0,"I bought this for my Chevy Avalanche. It seems pretty sturdy, though it moves around a little in the hitch. You'd have to pay close attention when standing on it: the step is compact (which, on the plus side, means it won't set off the rear parking assist sensors).The step itself looks and feels a little cheap, though I'm sure it's plenty strong enough for the job... just don't expect to turn heads with this lump of plastic fastened to the back of your rig.The supplied pin doesn't lock, and doesn't take much to remove, but some other steps don't even include one.Most importantly, though: the step doesn't extend far enough for the Avalanche's tailgate. With the tailgate down the step is entirely covered, which completely defeats the point of the extendable step! You might be able to get a toe on it, while whacking your shin on the tailgate, but forget about easily stepping up onto the tailgate.I'm guessing you'd be fine if you have a Ford Ranger (~ 16"" tailgate), but the Avalanche's is 27"" high. No go.I'm returning this one; I'll either get a plain non-extending step, for collision protection and reaching onto the vehicle, or look for an alternative extending step."

141368,1,"fit my mopar 5.2L v8 perfectly. replaced it along with the tensioner 89008 pulley and a goodyear gatorback serp belt. Suddenly... all the squeaking noises are gone.More than likely your tensioner and idler pulleys will wear out before the serp belt. If you dont replace those pulleys soon enough, the bearings will freeze and destroy your serp belt leaving you stranded not to mention copious amounts of serpentine goodness melted and sprayed around your engine compartment. These pulleys have sealed bearings and they say they supposed to last forever. That is utter BS. Don't be an idiot. spend the 40 bucks and replace the idler and tension pulleys every 50k miles.-1 star for overpriced... 25 bucks for a pulley is too expensive IMHO but I have no choice since amazon is actually much cheaper than the other guys.GL truckers"
110075,0,"I haven't installed this yet, because it is the DIMMER SWITCH for the headlights (which i don't think is the problem, so i may be sending it back). APPEARS to be in fine condition and arrived timely."
174992,0,"The Cap arrived as scheduled, and was as described. I did notice that although Amazon's ""MAKE SURE IT FITS"" selection screen says it does fit my application the Cap arrived as a 16psi cap, my factory application is a 15psi cap. It is still acceptable, however the site should be updated."
28475,0,This product when installed will not fit properly into the fitting since it has that extra 1.5 inch space at the bottom. Stock resorvoir for the 1.5 Manual Transmission Radiator is shorter than this. Even so with a little of force will fit.
37023,1,"Nothing fancy, but a great, sturdy and simple design that does what I need. I ride in the desert and in high desert mountains. It's very hard terrain and I needed a well made, strong trunk that has the ability to be locked when I'm away from my quad, exploring on foot. This Tamarack(tm) Classic Standard Quad Trunk meets all of my needs and expectations. I'm a photographer, and use my quad to get way off the beaten path and in to some very remote areas. This trunk allows me to securely carry food, water, photographic equipment and emergency / survival gear with me."
91249,0,"When I ordered these shocks I did so with two other shocks and two struts(different vehicles), so it made sense to do so based on the combined purchase price. As far as convenience, I would have been better off to buy these at a local parts store.Unfortunately these shocks didn't come with all the parts. Although the packaging was unopened, it was missing the rubber bushings for one of the shocks. Fortunately I was able to buy the additional parts from a local parts store rather than waiting any longer for the missing pieces to be delivered. Finally, I'm not sure were these shocks were stored or how they were handled, but they had a few dings and dents on them...as far as I can tell it hasn't affected the performance though."
167386,1,Does a great job keeping my AGM lead acid battery up to charge without risking any damage to it.
44956,1,"Expensive! That's what a lot of people say about K&N; filters. However, they are typically less than the cost of two OEM filters, which are not reusable. So in the long run, you can (and do) save money. However, this particular filter (BM-1205) is no longer used in current vehicle production, so I was able to get it less than half of what it normally costs.Also, K&N; gets a lot of criticism for ""letting in dirt"" and for ""messing up MAF's"". If you use it and reoil it right, it performs just as well as an OEM filter. Its when you over oil it that you start messing up MAF's and when you don't do any maintenance on it is when it starts letting dirt through. I've used them in many of my vehicles over the years and have never had a problem. MY UOA's (used oil analysis) have come out clean over the years I've used this with minimal silicon being reported (silicon = dirt).Also, even though many report having an increase in power/torque/MPG's, I have not. So don't expect to, either. But you will save some money in the long run if you intend to keep your vehicle and you service this filter as recommended."
174769,0,"I bought this from Amazon last month for $ 1.37, now the price is $ 11.57. What an inflation !"
76760,0,We drive 2 larger cars and although i found those easy to apply they are a bit small for or windows (and again too large to fit 2 in one window).I was able to remove and replace them which is convient but am still on the search for a great window solution as we have a lot of sun where we live...
42646,0,"If you're a perfectionist you might want to find some other glow-in-the-dark paint or mix your own. This stuff comes out thick and cake-y and will be very difficult to lay evenly without a bunch of sanding.Also this is only a 7oz. can. The instructions say it should cover 10-12 sqaure feet, but honestly it looked to me like one can was good for maybe 3, if you want even coverage. Maybe buy one more can than you think you need.The unilluminated color as the others have said is a pale yellow."
132905,1,"This battery charger is very versatile and powerful for its size. I am a mechanic and it is nice to have all the features of a full size battery charger in a unit that will fit in my toolbox. Looks big, but is fairly lightweight. Highly recommended."
16684,0,"I just received these goggles in the mail today. First test was putting them over my glasses right off the bat. I go camping twice a year with my youngest daughter in OK and each time we take a horseback ride and I walk with her horse in tow usually about 2-3 miles. If I am the last person behind all of the others, I am usually covered in trail dust and my allergies are killing me. Within only a few minutes my eyes are so swollen they are bulging out of my head and bloodshot red. No amount of allergy medication will do the trick so I am hoping these will be my saving grace.At first inspection over my glasses the strap adjusted nicely to my huge skull (size 8+ for most hats). What I will tell you is that the seal around the eyes is made from foam. The dark kind of foam like what you see in most camera lense cases. My feeling is this wont make it more then 2-3 hikes if I am lucky before this foam rots off. I am going to try and make them last, but i am suspect I'll be buying another pair/make-model if they fall apart."
6163,0,Pulled the unit out of the box and two screws that hold the handle on had fallen out. Luckily they were in the box and will lock-tite them in before I install it.
68461,0,Product is excellent.The issue was in the product description- unclear as to what make and models it will work for.
144386,0,What the description does not say (and why I give it only 3 stars) is that it has a maximum continuous output of 560 watts. This is right below the limit of what I need. So don't buy this is 560 isn't enough. Other than that it works just fine and it gives a nice annoying alarm when the source battery charge drops--either that or it was a thermal alarm.I now get to do more research and find an inverter that actually will put out 700 watts continuous. (Looking at the Black-Decker-750-Watt-Inverter which says it handles 750w continuous and peaks at 1500 or maybe the Coleman 800w Power Inverter which peeks at 1600w.)
1439,0,"The item arrived quickly, but the quality appears a bit poor. It was also definitely not specific to the Pathfinder; some work had to be done to get it to work on the vehicle."
143482,0,"I purchased these replacement bulbs for my 2003 Dodge Ram Pick-up truck. Some improvemnet over the 9007L's that it came equipped with, but not enough to justify the much higher price. What the web-site doesn't tell you is that the life of the bulbs is only 25% of the regular 9007 bulbs! Sylanvia tells you that on the back side of the packaging. Put that on the front and I would have stuck with the less expensive bulbs."
108595,0,"It works off of battery inside the coloured encasement, which has it's pro's and con's. No wiring is needed, though you had to manually turn it on and off and the batteries need to be replaced.It didn't fit on my Mazda B2300 even though Amazon said it would. I spent a couple of hours drilling away at it and even at my shifter to just make it fit an inch. I couldn't even get it on all the way. Very disappointing."
149016,1,"Very easy to install,, fits most of the cars. Side of the car looks cleaner with these mudflaps.. cool stuff"
116058,0,"worked great, no leaks, but it did not fit that much. I would purchase a bigger one next time around."
138943,0,Purchased these for my Dozer but when it was delivered with a large crack across one of the lenses I figured I would not bother. I could return them or order another but decided to go a different route. A little more packing in the box would have saved me some inconvenience. I am a loyal Northern customer but things like this do not help the relationship!!
77571,1,"I checked out the advice at Consumers Report (Consumers Union)and they are right. The blades provide a clear streak free wipe of the windshield. Even when the window is not very wet, they still do a great job with no squeaky rubbing noise. For little more than the price of an expensive brew at Starbucks, you can enjoy these wiper blades. Remember, blades are supposed to be changed every 6 to 12 months. They are a maintenance item."
76667,1,"For the brief time I had it, it appeared very sturdy and my EZ Pass fit in it nicely. But then my dog ate it. I reused the suction cups on the old holder for now but plan to buy this one again."
160037,2,"I ordered these Quick Struts (Monroe 171661 Quick-Strut Complete Strut Assembly) so I would not have to disassemble the strut assemblies only to find out that the back of my car was 3 inches lower than the front after installing all 4 new Monroe quick struts. I found that the rear quick strut assemblies had the wrong springs. When I removed the springs and compared them with the factory springs, the factory springs were 3.5 inches taller, had one more spring loop and were thicker. This was not a case of ordering the wrong strut, there is only one quick strut listed for the 2008 Buick Lacrosse 4 door. DO NOT BUY THESE UNLESS YOU WANT ADDITIONAL EXPENSE AND WORK."
127200,0,"I fit this product on a 1999 TL.The top-(center} of the joint is too tall, to get it to fit properly, the mechanic had to file it off. If this is not done it will restrict the side to side turning of your wheels as it rubs against your ABS sensor.Why is this hump in the center (top)?"
31574,0,"I bought this based mainly on the reviews from previous customers and also because of the amazing low cost it has. Its even cheaper than the original air filter.I was very excited to install it on my car and see any noticeable difference, unfortunately there isnt any big difference. Dont expect this to be like a cold air intake or that you car will make differences sounds.I felt the car had a better kick when accelerating or perhaps is a placebo effect.Either ways, its cost affordable, you can wash it and gives better mpg. My final recommendations is to buy it, but with correct expectations."
11846,1,"The Battery Tender Plus is a complete recharging station for the batteries used in lawn care equipment and scooters for the disabled and elderly. The unit is sold with all the cables needed to connect to the battery and a clear set of instructions for setting up the charger safely. The instructions could use some editing to explain the light functions; they are anything but intuitive. Once I figured out the lights, I was able to put the charger to good use bringing several apparently dead batteries back to full life. Note: many of the chargers that come with scooters will not charge a battery that has discharged past a certain percentage. The batteries are not dead but require a charger such as this to recover their charge. This is a great investment when compared to the price of new batteries for a scooter!"
3421,0,Was the wrong part for vehicle even though the site said it was correct. I had to send it back.
178569,0,"This works great for casually keeping wind and sun off of your neck. It will also keep you dryer than you'd be with out it.However, it will not for a tight seal with a windjammer and duster, nor will any doors make a seal of any sort. There are other products that fit that bill, this it not it.I use this thing all summer and it's fine for what I expect.My biggest issue with this product is the nylon straps they use to tie it down to the rollbar. They a TOO SHORT. If Bestop had made these 2-3 inches longer the install would take half the time. I guarantee that you will be frustrated as I was the first few times you put it on. After a will everything stretches and it's a little easier.Pro tip: needle nose pliers.I contacted Bestop regarding my frustration and suggested longer straps and metal hardware (as the plastic strap locks tend to break after a couple years) and they offered to send me a new one. I did receive it, nor would that have fixed the issue."
113898,1,"It read steadily and accurately. I even cut the hose to add my own adapter, and it worked great."
134989,2,"I just re-read the description, and the above seat cover description is a gross misrepresentation. It incorrectly, if not fraudulently indicates that the covers were customized to fit my specific model. The covers are a sloppy fit, especially on the passenger side, and the controls that are not completely covered are available only through wide sloppy generic openings obviously made to account for any number of general configurations."
97917,1,Bought a truck and hated the brown interior and these fit PERFECT! LOVE Amy Brown!
137419,1,Super fast shipping. This kit is very complete and gives excellent results. Everything is of great quality. If I had one complaint it would be nice to see a set of instructions with it.
33735,1,"I have heated seats in my car, so I felt bad for some of my friends/relatives who did not during this horribly cold winter, so I bought a handful as gifts. Wagan has made me look so good, as each recipient LOVED they seat and is thankful for a toasty warm seat on those cold winter days. It is VERY easy to install and use. I would highly recommend...in fact I plan to buy a few more as gifts!!!"
24362,0,"Made my car look kind of sporty looking but it wasn't easy to install, windows don't close all the way sometimes."
13030,1,"Spray on, let dry a moment and buff. Sure beats a day with wax and polish. Great for routine finish care."
88110,1,My car was running so bad and I was just about to take it to the repair shop.At the last minute I thought I would try these plugs because of the rebate.Now my car runs very smooth and has a little more power and never took it to the shop. SUPER PLUGS!!!
18180,0,"install was easy and straightforward. looks good on bike and illuminates very brightly.small gap between plastic and the light..say 1/16"".. i like things perfect on my bike soit could use a gasket in between.. they also fail to warn you to buy resistors if youplan on running led tail lights. i am, and after installing them was let down to realizethey didn't blink without these resistors.. hotbodies doesn't offer them for sale or evenhave a suggestion where to find them which is lame. i also went threw a company here onamazon called ridders needs i think, they charged my 7 bucks for shipping then mailed itto me via snail mail..bought a resistor and still didn't fix the problem, each light needsto be wired with its own resistor. removed my aftermarket tails and went back to thestandard bulb type to fix the problem and get back on the street.."
98275,0,The guage is about 5lbs off and the clamp does not seat well on the valve stem. The advertisement that it is able to be used w/ one hand is a bit optimistic since the mechansim that clamps the hose to the valve stem doesn't work great.Overall it fills my bike tires fine and once you know the error in the guage it works ok.
120688,1,the best for your car and it only took me about 60 minutes to install.i love it . it made my caprice ltz 94 go from 0km to 100km in 7.65 secon a stock injen not loud like thay sayit is a 100% fit to my lt1eazy to install
81573,0,I was never able to remove the brass fitting on the air pressure guage to properly install the sleeve. I wound up cutting part of the sleeve to get it on
51908,0,"I got one of these for the 2007-08 Honda Fit. The box says that is what I got, but the fit on the dash is pretty bad. It is clearly slightly too wide and can't ever be smoothed out all the way because of this. The reason I got it was to keep the car a bit cooler and reduce reflections, and it does that fine, but it is far from perfect. I give it a grudging 3 stars, as there is really no excuse for it to fit so poorly given that it supposedly matches my exact car model and year.P.S. I inherited one of these from the same company with a purchase of a 2001 Honda Insight (the real Insight, not the new huge one) and it fit excellently and was of a better quality. That one was from the original owner, and it is now about 10 years old and is still in great condition."
182328,1,"I'm an average guy who knows very little about working on cars, so I can't speak to things like performance.When I was getting the oil changed on my 1995 Toyota Corolla they performed a courtesy check on various parts of the car, in the hopes of finding problems for them to fix I'm sure. Well, they said the spark plugs needed replace along with the wires, distributor cap and rotor because they showed signs of arcing. I hadn't experienced any issues with the car, but they wanted a rather huge sum of money to fix it. Plus $10 to change a light bulb *rolls eyes*.Since I never noticed anything unusual with the car I let it go. Fast forward two years and I noticed, rarely, that the car would stutter a little when going up a steep on ramp to the interstate. Searching the internet seamed to suggest this problem is the result of a problem with the electrical system. I remembered the warnings from before, and decided I had actually better get those replaced... so here I am, with you tube videos and parts ordered off Amazon.Surprisingly everything worked out, and replacing all the parts was actually far easier than I had originally thought. Everything works at the end, and has for a couple months now. I'll be sure to update this review if anything fails.The other parts I ordered for this job were:Bosch 04194 Ignition RotorBosch 03372 Distributor CapGearWrench 80546 5/8-Inch x 6-Inch Swivel Spark Plug SocketThe spark plugs I got at AutoZone because they were cheaper and had a rebate. They were Bosch Platinum Plus spark plugs.Today I discovered one of my front break pads disintegrated so now I'm off to try and fix that myself... good luck!"
37335,1,Bought two of these for our travel trailer that has two steps.Husband says it was an easy quick install.It looks good on the steps (new trailer definitely want it to look good)Stays in place and weathers well.This trailer has no carpeting so dirt shows up quickly. this definitely helps reduce the amount of dirt being tracked into the trailer. While these are important I also have an awing rug on the ground outside the trailer and a small rug inside the door. (have grandchild that travels with us so everything that can help reduce the dirt is huge)
48010,0,Ordered 2 and one was faulty. I am about to return it to the factory and I am hoping that they will stand behind it and send me a replacement.
26255,2,"I ordered this tire gauge a year ago and the first one was DOA. The light worked but it would not produce a pressure reading. Returned the defective one and received another one of these. The second one worked for about 9 months then it failed. Replaced the batteries (more money!) and same thing - the light works but gauge produced no pressure reading. I kept the gauge in the house in the planning desk to keep it warm, all to no benefit. In my opinion this item is junk. I'm going back to non-electronic gauges."
44967,1,way cheaper than k&n on website got it for my honda vtx 1300 c and looks like exact fit yet to put it on sense its winter fast shipping as well!
42592,1,"I like the effect of the silicone on the windshield. It makes the water drops more rounded and the space in between them clearer, so the visibility is better without having to turn on the wipers so often. I could see the difference on the areas where the silicone wiper doesn't go. The water drops are splayed out and one can't see through them. It's blurry.I'm not giving it 5 stars yet because I used them only for 2 weeks so far. I want to see how long they last."
29279,1,I used this tool to disassemble the hydraulic trim cylinder on my 2004 Yamaha f225. It worked great. I did have to grind the tip of the tool a small amount so the piston would not get scratched. I highly recomend this product.
59277,0,"They fit the seat okay, the order also came with some arm rest covers but my Titan does not have armrests? There is no cover for the center box as shown in the picture but it is not listed in the description either so whatever custom..."
66182,2,"This product is designed for a ""universal fit"", but on my 2005 Sea Doo there wasn't enough lip suface on the bow to accomodate proper fit for riveting the unit to the boats surface."
103482,1,"We saw this at King Soopers and it was all scuffed up from people but it worked perfectly and felt sturdy. It was the same price 12.9x in KS's but we ordered from Amazon so we could have a non-scuffed up freshie. Heavy plastic, honey comb interior, our 2 year old can fold it up and down."
119383,1,Love the yakima system. Installation instructions are easy to follow and the clips make a solid connection to my van. I'm securely hauling kayaks and other gear.
174255,0,"the quality of these floor mats is very good and given the price, I expected as much. I checked and double checked before placing my order that the mats would fit my 2006 Honda Accord. They did not. The fuel cap/truck release on the 2006 Honda Accord driver's side floor falls under the floor mat. My solution was to cut a notch out of the mat. It works, but I would have preferred a mat that fit without alterations."
114987,1,"This is a very nice beaded cushion. The one I had previous fell apart, and this one is much sturdier and well-made. Keeps you cool in the summer for sure."
177720,1,This is a great price for a &#34;forever filter&#34; disposables are 1/2 the price so it starts saving you money quickly (not to mention it performs better as well)
26028,1,"This product works great, the programming instructions included are accurate and easy to follow.I just followed the instructions for the F150 pickup truck to program the E150 Econoline van. Too easy."
137176,2,I had this Edelbrock fuel filter for about 5 months now on my project car which I am almost finish rebuilding. I have notice little pieces of rust has been passing through and clogging up my carb. I have open and cleaned my Autolite 4100 carb twice already and still with the same problem. I might have gotten a bad filter but i doubt it.
48662,1,"My husband liked his so much that he decided to get one for our daughter's family. They love it, too!"
21913,1,"This product is very well made BUT I found out that even if it looks like all you get all seat covers you DO NOT (maybe my own bad) I thoughtI would receive covers for all 4 ! - No I got only the real covers - True I should of saw where it said Custom seat cover NOT covers ! So I will say thisReview is only to help others who may make the same error I have - The product as I said is very nice BUT I didn't want to spend 400 $ just yet, IReturned the item under reason - item received was not as shown as on website as the image shows ALL seats - Please understand Im not saying theseAre not a good product Im just saying be aware you only get the one - Very confusing to shop this item !!MichaelHope this was of some help"
17606,2,"I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!"

111733,1,"I have it installed for a few months and it never come to loss. Not only that I did not wash the floor (just ""dry cleaned"" the concret floor with paper towls, as I did not read instruction before hand), I even removed it once after it was first installed to change to a new position. It was hard to remove though once it glued to the floor the 1st time, I had to use some heavy tools to almost break the plastic before tearing some of the glue paper off the base. But even with only part of the glue paper on the bottom, I replaced it to a new position and it have stayed there formly ever since, stopping wheels at least twice a day. Further more, when I installed my 2nd one, I had to remove it two times before it was placed in a right position (my mistake). But after the 2nd time removal, it could not stick to the floor anymore. Then I used some double-side-glue pad (1""x1"", like 20 of them) at the bottom and it worked just as well for two months so far."
115520,1,"i was very impressed when i got this item. It was in great shape. I later that day installed it in my van and hooked up my Dash Board Camera, that i also received today, and my Radar Scanner and my GPS. This item works very well and has done its job very well. The reason i give it a 4 start is because the sticky pad on the bottom that is to hold it to something is like putting a piece of scotch tape on a picture and frame and hanging it to the wall. It wont stick. If the made some heavy duty Velcro or something that would make it hold better then it would be given a 5 start. Other than that it is a very great product."
154370,1,"Was a quick, cheap and easy replacement kickstand for my 26"" women's mountain bike that I was able to install myself and use immediately."

135402,1,"As good as you can get an overweight steel barge to handle.Seriously though, I slapped them on my 86 K5 blazer and the handling change was amazing. Absolutely stunning difference and you owe it to yourself to try a set. Most likely your shocks are blown already so anything is better than nothing, but these are way better than anything else you are gonna get."
68439,2,"Even though there are several images in different colors of the same model, you will receive whatever color they feel like sending. It is tacky to spend money on a grey cover when the rest of your interior is tan."
172600,1,I just retired and bought an old bike to fix up over the summer. This manual is priceless!!!! It tells you everything and gives you more less all the pictures and descriptions of how-to's and how-not-to. They say you can build a bike from just the frame up. I believe it. I used this so I could work on the carbureter and the clutch. It told me exactly what I needed to do and all the parts/tools required.
126459,0,"The part appears to be well made and for the most part, it fit perfectly. On the factory part, the ball joint stud has a recessed hex so the nut can be tightened while the stud is held in place with an allen wrench. These thrust arms do not have a way to hold the stud. I was able to get the nut tightened by using a prybar to press against the top of the thrust arm and run the nut on with my impact gun.Time will well if the legendary Moog quality is comparable or better than the OE parts."
163308,0,I was disappointed when I opened that box and there was no sample of wax as advertised. I followed the directions and used the clay on the hood and car roof. I'm not sure if my car needed to be clayed because it was pretty smooth from the start but I did see some dirt on the clay bar as I went.

18258,1,"I drive a Mercedes S-430, which I consider to be the finest car on the road.The manual states that the oil should only be suctioned, with a device such as the Mityvac 7400; but, for reasons unknown, even to me, I have stubbornly drained the oil the old fashioned way...until recently. The manual even states that the design of the oil pan is such that suctioning will remove more oil than draining.The Mityvac was just too easy to use. The line that goes down the dip stick tube was so long that I only needed to connect the one line, instead of two, as the manual suggests.It didn't take that many pumps to remove the 8 quarts of oil. You could hear it sucking, like a kid sucking a straw at a soda fountain.Why didn't I buy this thing years ago...why...why!!! The whole job only took 10 minutes. What a fool I've been!"

100415,0,"This pump fit my BMW E38 perfectly (main windshield jets only, you'll need a second, larger pump for the headlights). However, it is noticeably noisier, very much so. Despite being buried under many things, and far away from the driver's seat, the sound it makes is something even a Kia owner would be embarrassed about - about the equivalent of having one of those Water Pik things a few feet away.Not only does it make a lot of noise when operating, it also looks and feels rather cheap. Not sure how to describe that in words, but it just ""feels"" like it'll die in a few months.I'd recommend spending the extra $15 and going OEM, especially since the washer fluid pump isn't easily accessible."

158352,1,This tire cover was perfect. It fit my 15 inch spare tire on my travel trailer. It covers the whole tire with no problem. You will have to snug it up real good and tie the straps in a knott. The shipping from this company was very fast.
182299,0,"First of all, the product works, it hooks into the existing brake line harness, and provides brake light and turn signals to the trailer, so on that note 5 stars.Installation is a little difficult to get the connectors hooked up, the rubber weather seal is a little too big, it required me to get channel locks out to squeeze the connector together. The factory connectors were definitely not this tight. But on the plus side, it should keep the moisture out."

I settled on this alert because it makes noise at any speed and you can tell if it is working. just got back from riding one week in N Calif and noticed deer along the road and back in the fields perk up and watch me as i went by,the other bikes in the group recieved no such special attention, other animals also seem to notice and flee. the sound the device makes resembles a wounded creature of somekind. I basically think the device gets the animal to notice you and watch opposed to not noticing you and just running where ever they may please and in your path. Glad I now own one."

109563,2,I purchased this product because it came with extra adapters to charge different items. The day that I got it I plugged up my kids DVD plyer and the light came on and went off and never worked again. Called the company they apologized and sent another one. The second charger worked for a day and hasn't worked since. So called the company back to let them know and they told me to mail them back and they would reimburse my money but it would cost me more than what I paid for to send it back.

129519,1,"I received an old Yakima sytem previously used on a huge car. I drive a little BMW and really needed a carrier for my mountain bikes, kayaks, etc. I was excited to get the whole system but quickly discoved the clips which secure the system to the car were not going to work. After a bit of research I found these clips on Amazon and ordered them right away. The arrived quickly and are the same durable quality you would expect from Yakima. I was able to assemble the carrier system and mount it securely to the roof of my small BMW 323i. Without these clips the system would have been useless to me and still be sitting on the floor or my garage. In the future when I change cars all I'll need to do is change clips and the Yakima system will stay with me forever. Great product!"

64387,0,"This product helped minimally. My dent was about 2 inch diameter circle and it didn't work all that well. I ended up getting some of the large dent out, but it left multiple small dents over the area. Although it is somewhat less noticeable from before, it still needs some work and that is something only a body shop could probably do. Also, after using it a few times, the pieces began to fall apart and I couldn't use it anymore. Overall, it was ok, probably wouldn't buy it again."
174490,1,This is just fine. Not too thin. No problems. Would buy another one.
56579,2,This product is totally useless. Trying to deal with this as you are driving may even be dangerous. Not worth it.

66350,1,"I've ridden with this jacket a couple of times now in upper 80 weather, and when you're moving it keeps you cool. The loose mesh and perforated leather lets the air through. I'm sure with the liner in this will be good for cooler days, too. It has excellent shoulder, elbow, side and upper and lower back protection. It's well made and it looks great too. I ordered the 2XL and it fit just as I expected it to. I'm very happy with this Joe Rocket Reactor jacket, and it looks like this jacket is going to last a long time."
133800,2,I did a careful search and was told the part would fit my vehicle. The part I received was a raybestos part number 2091. The correct part for my 1998 GMC Safari is raybestos part number 2034. I was given a prompt refund and bought the parts elsewhere.

51280,0,I'm a little disappointed in Hi-Lift Jack. Top is 2 piece and welded in the middle. Should have been one piece. They supplied a bolt rather than some sort of quick release pin to attach it. A bolt with a hand tightened nut will vibrate loose during transport. The hook on the bottom could have been a little deeper to grab onto other items other than round bumpers more securely. All in all a good add-on for your Hi-lift jack but it could have been designed a little better.
181129,0,"I bought the Flowmaster 425501-L 50, Flowmaster 425501-R 50, and Walker Exhaust 40305 Y-Pipe for my 1984 Corvette. The Y pipe fit perfectly to my Catalytic converter, however I did notice that the inside of the pipe wasn't done all that well at the location where the two pipes initially split, there are two sections of the pipe sticking halfway through the single pipe, which makes it look like a lot of air would get trapped there, thus slowing the exhaust flow."
165753,0,I liked this set alot but think the workmenship could have been a little better.
28476,1,"I probably would not have bought this, had it not been for the OEM's intake tube began leaking air around a blocked-off fitting, which was giving me some ""un-metered"" air. BUT now I am glad I did!My particular set-up is a supercharged engine that uses a MAF sensor for measuring the airflow - which requires a simple ""laptop tuning program"" to allow the user to perform air/fuel trimming. So I needed absolute control of such things when tuning the AFR,(air/fuel ratio).I saw this system recommended on the K&N; website and was pleased to find it at a good price through Amazon Prime. After buying and installing it, my findings were as follows.Benefits include:1) Its massively large re-useable cone filter has a huge total-surface of air input.2) Good sturdy, multi-point mounting,(that holds the tube so tight you can shake your entire motor bygrabbing/moving it).3) It uses existing OEM locations for all mounting, cabling, and hose connections for a clean bolt-oninstallation so no drilling or extra mods are required.4) A heat shield which includes soft rubber edging - to attempt separating the ""intake air's""compartment, from the (hotter) engine's compartment/area.5) A far ""less restrictive"" airflow design,(compared to the OEM's) backed-up by a real-world Dynoprintout, documenting a bolt-on, 9 HP gain (over the OEM system).All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at this unit's performance and quality. I had modified my OEM air intake before, to increase the air intake/reduce the restriction of the OEM air box system. But this K&N; system is an excellent replacement - and it is just what it claims to be.It is a nice, solid performing unit and you can hear/feel the difference. I believe it is one of the few aftermarket items advertising ""HP gain"" that proves its legitimacy - and is worth the price paid."
7297,1,"Good for using with a lead acid battery and inverter system. A bit of jury-rigging is required, but I bought some brass hardware and put it in line between the battery and the inverter.

142695,1,"I wanted a windshield for my bike that reduced the wind on my chest and acted as a bug shield on my morning commutes. This works great for that. It also substantially reduces wind gust buffeting and it has improved my gas mileage by at least 5 mpg. A very pleasant surprise. The windshield and quick-release mounting hardware are very well made and the install was easy. The windshield can be removed and reinstalled in seconds. I don't like the look of windshields, so I wanted a quick release system so I could cruise after work and on weekends without one. This looks so good though that I have no need to remove it. Oh yeah, did I mention that it has SUBSTANTIALLY increased my gas mileage. It will easily pay for itself in less than a year."

50369,1,"I was pretty excited to get this in the mail. Yes I am easily impressed. I wanted to impress my husband with how well I could degrease his work clothes, I was using oven cleaner spray (which works like magic) but it's a bit expensive considering I could blow through a can of that on one pair of his jeans. I diluted 50/50 and wasn't thrilled. I did less and less diluting and decided that I would try washing them with OE straight soaked into the stains. It broke some of them up, but it's still no match to the easy off, maybe because the oven cleaner is lye-based?Perhaps I should be wiping the grease off with a rag after using the OE solution? I wanted less work and more degreasing...I'm going to try Simple Green on his clothes next time, then if that doesn't work I'll try another lye based cleaner that's not so expensive. I'm going to try the OE on some regular household laundry stains, I tried it on the perm marker on my daughter's shirt, but that's not oil based so presumably why the stain was unscathed.""UPDATE 4/18/12Up to four stars after several months of seeking comparable cleaning power from something without lye.

75390,1,"After carefully doing research online to see who offered the best price, including delivery, for a brand new Corsa 14212 Pro-Series, 4 inch, dual rear exit, touring exhaust system, I decided to purchase from Amazon.com. The item was in stock and my purchase, electronic secure online payment and delivery went very quickly and smoothly - no problems at all. Item arrived complete and undamaged in less than a week.The installation of my new exhaust system on my 2007 H3 Hummer went without any problems. Using a lift, and both power and hand tools, two of us were able to remove my old factory exhaust system and install my new Corsa system in a less than 2 hours, taking our time and being careful not to damage the reusable old hanger parts.Fit and finish of the new Corsa exhaust system is excellent. The sound is mellow and easy to the ear when you are at cruising speeds and ""talks to you"" when you put your ""pedal to the metal."" This Corsa system really looks and sounds great. I don't know if it improved gas mileage, but you can feel the improvement in performance every time you ""put your foot in it.""All in all, it was a very satisfying online buying experience of an excellent product."
33114,1,"I just changed oil after installing this filter about 8 months ago. I ran it just under 5,000 miles, and checked the oil regularly (did not have to add any oil during that time). When I drained the oil, it looked pretty dark, but the last time I checked the oil before draining, it was still a dark honey color and certainly far from looking like it was overdue for a change. I was running Motorcraft 5-20 synthetic blend oil in a 2002 Ford Focus DOHC 2L 4 banger with 80,000 miles on the odometer. Overall, based on observations from the Ford OEM (Fl 2005 and Fl400) filters I've used in the same engine with the same oil, this Wix 51315 filter performed very well. The engine ran smooth, was quiet at start up, and the oil was reasonably clean over the Ford recommended change interval. I'd use this Wix filter (or the NAPA Gold equivalent) again.Note, this Wix filter seemed to be comparable in performance to the Motorcraft FL 2005 (discontinued?), and far superior to the Motorcraft FL400 filter. I would not buy another Motorcraft FL400 filter for this motor under any circomstances because we'd get knocking at start up, the oil was dirty in only 3,000 miles, and while the FL400 filter is now recommended for this motor by Ford, it was never originally intended for this motor. No, that does not make sense, but the proof is in the performance, and the FL 2005 no longer seems to be available from Ford Motorcraft. Not a problem as long as I can get this Wix filter."
154628,2,"I've been using these wiper blades for several years, and was quite satisfied with them - they were better than the cheap wipers most service centers put on my car...However, the last two sets I've purchased have been sub-par, streaking within a few weeks of use, and needing to be replaced after two months of light use... With snow and ice, the wipers were not effective at clearing the windshield to the point where it was dangerous to continue driving.I'm guessing the formula and construction of the wiper has changed. Given the price, I would be hard-pressed to purchase these wipers in the future."

I'm sure that it would work fine on a light red vehicle, but it didn't work at all on my darker one. I'm not complaining about the product, Turtle Wax is a quality company, but this just didn't work for my car. Make sure you have a lighter red color car if you want it to work."

Took the door all apart again to remove the regulator and figure out what was wrong. Had power at the plug in point to the regulator, tested the regulator motor with jumper wires, it worked, finally figured out the connecting pins in the supplied regulator connector were too short to make contact when plugged in and fully seated. Had to cut off the plug from the old regulator and spliced it onto the supplied new regulator. Spent more time trouble shooting, removing and reinstalling this new regulator than it would have taken to fix the broken regulator I had."

6684,1,"A little bit about my driving conditions and why I mentioned in the title that the product has been a real help...I am in Boone N.C. I have to drive down (on a gravel road) from the top of a hill to get to the main road. The problem is that our road does not get plowed that quickly like the main roads in the city. The road while coming down from my house has two very sharp curves and the incline is quite steep.With the cables on, I have not had any problems with my car - '97 Lexus ES 300 (front-wheel drive) in the snow and/or ice. Handling is very secure and that is why I feel confident. Previously I used to leave my car down the mountain or hitch a ride with a neighbor. Before putting it on for the first time, see the video on the product page - that really helped me. The written directions that came with it were difficult for me to follow - maybe it is me! The cables are tight and with continuous use, it does get a little bit comfortable in terms of putting it on. Taking it off is relatively less painful.Keep a pair of working gloves in the car; the kit (when I bought it) comes with a pair of plastic ones that reach to the elbows but I have not used them. In fact, I have a ski pant and jacket and wear them when I am putting on and taking off the chains. That way my work clothes do not get dirty. May be I am not that adept at doing it (could also be because I am out of shape), because sometimes I have to squat or get on all fours to get other the end of the cable from behind the tire. I also think it may be helpful if you could get something to reach the cable from behind the tire and help you bring it to the front. The video shows the guy using something, but I use a twig or a small branch that I always find when I am putting them on or taking them off. Finally, do not forget to lubricate them after using - I use WD-40.Well, that is my review - I am not at all comfortable driving in the snow (actually more uncomfortable in the ice); I have a FWD car that does extremely well with the chains on; it is difficult to put them on; but just like everything with practice it becomes easier. I mainly use the chains to drive down and up my snowy/icy gravel road and rarely have to use it on a flat road (where I assume it will be even better in terms of driving).Last thing, I just came up today (01/26/11) with the chains on and our road was absolutely horrible - all slushy and at at least 3 - 4 inches of that. It was a little scary, but the drive up was fun!!"
122455,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."

10506,0,I have several of these in red and amber. The light output isn't as good as competing incandescent side markers. The viewing angle is not as good as most incandescent side markers. The tiny size is a problem as would take very little dirt or snow to block. The plastic is thick enough that it should hold up to moderate abuse. I would not trust them to survive off road use. One advantage is that these use 68 mA at 12V. For use at nominal 24v I use 200 ohm 1 watt resistor in series.
121179,1,"Just got my radiator in and all I can say is the quality is great for the price. It matched up with my existing radiator perfectly. I thought I read somewhere when I was ordering this radiator that it didnt have a drain plug, but it actually has one. Mounted in my car just perfectly and all the fan mounting holes lined up just fine. If anyone was wondering I ordered this for my 1993 Accord. Best $66 spent for my cooling system."
1877,0,"The size of this is a bit small, it could be a bit larger in height. The biggest issue I have is the side ties. They are not in a location that helps keep this down. There should be two on each side, on top and bottom. As it is now there is one on each side right in the center. The top and bottom of this shield are not held down, so if there is any wind at all it flaps around in the wind. Only the center is secured.It works, and for the price I can't complain too much - but it doesn't do the job as well as it could if the design were a bit different."
88057,2,"No, no... and no! This wax does not help remove swirl marks as it claims! Works just like any other wax; easy to apply and difficult to buff.

74867,1,"This is a well constructed litter bag for the car; does fit nicely around the headrests but doesn't lie well against the back of the seat as i'd hoped. Does lie nicely against the front of the seat but needs to be swung out of the way if someone wants to sit in the front passenger seat. I ended up putting it in front on the floor of the passenger side of car and hanging the strap around the shifter to keep it in place. Top is rigid so stays open nicely to drop things into it without much trouble but the sides/base are not rigid at all so free standing isn't an option. I did look at the measurements before I bought it but it seems quite a bit larger than I expected so I must not have been realistic mentally picturing it, and will be in the way of someone's legs when someone is in the front passenger seat, same as it would be in the way of a passenger sitting in front if I had hung it around the headrest uprights. Overall a nice litter bag but it just doesn't work well in my car."
65067,0,I ordered 2 pairs of these for thirty bucks in total after fifteen dollars in promotional discount.They fit great to first row in my first generation Sienna but the second row they did not fit at all.I just put one and a smaller rubber mat next to it.These mats are nicely made quality mats with no over-powering rubber smell.But they are not custom-made.They fit to several dozens of applications.

171091,1,"I have a 1998 F150 that has a blown head gasket, we tested the exhaust gas in the antifreeze and the test fluid instantly turned yellow. I decided what the heck we will just try some block and gasket repair, what could be the worste that could happen. If it worked to make the truck smoke a lot less than it was or I would still have to replace the head gasket. I received a flyer for the K&W; Nanotechnology Block and gasket repairer and decided I was going to try it. I was a little over whelmed by the step by step directions that needed to be done inorder just to see if it was going to work but I decided that if I was going to try it, I was going to follow the directions to the T and not skip a step. I am not going to bore you with every step that I took in following the directions, but to my suprise after the 12 hour wait and the final flush, I started the truck and to my suprise there was no white smoke...let the truck run for a while just to see if it was going to eventually start making the plumes of smoke that I grew to hate.. NO SMOKE!! I was baffled...so we broke out the tester and expected to watch the test fluid turn yellow as with the first time we tested it and again to my amazement the fluid stayed blue which indicates NO blown head gasket. It has been 3 days since we applied the block and gasket repair and I am still not seeing the smoke. I am truly amazed. I am not sure how long it will last but I am happy that it is working right now and not smoking as it was. This will definetly make it easier for me to sell or trade in the vehicle and get a better value for my truck. I dont believe in a mechanic in a bottle, but I am starting to think that there is a slim possibility that this stuff actually does what it says it does.Lisa"

We'll see in time.It's about a 4 hour install.I took mine to circuit city($160) and also get a bypass/passive for your vehicle. I had to get an extra key(dealer only,mine has a chip inbedded in the key!. I bought an extra remote on-line($109 shipped no tax free ship)and CirCity will progam it for free! You really have to pick the shop you go to and the insaller.I knew an employee at CCity and they referred me to him.The only beef I had was this seller did'nt pack properly,should've used bubblewrap around it and then cheetos/foam,the box was slightly crushed!Went thru: Discountjungle!

58216,1,"Filter is well-made and according to independent testing has very good flow and filtration capability. It is larger than some other 3"" filters out there, so beware of that if you have a tight space. I replaced the filter on my Injen intake (Tiburon SE V6) with this one, and it has been great so far. It did make the engine slightly louder, but that's probably because of the eaiser flow."
79,1,"Perfect replacement for the one that I'd broken off. First had minor problems which the vendor immediately replaced, didn't even want the old one back! I'd go with this group again, actually, I already have."
172811,1,"Tired of looking at my hand held CB radio lying in my Fit making static/whistling sounds and decided to to make it functional. Checked Amazon.com CB equipment and found the K-30 antenna(bit shorter rhan K-40 but same engineering technology) appeared reasonable! Checked other internet sites and it was apparent, none had a better price for this puppys' excellent specs, so I ordered it. This is simply an amateur evaluation for what it's worth but check my figures out to feel warmer!!It has a heavy duty magnet base perfect for its size, and mass is spread for ultimate weight distribution where it does the most good, bottom of base. Stainless stick is great quality and cost me new pair of Taiwan heavy duty cable cutters that didn't even indent it when I tried to cut off a 1/4"" to fine tune, but left a permanent hole in cutter bladesand finally, a USA made hacksaw blade did the trick and now SWR meter pegs low to hi band channels! Magnet got ultimate test when I forgot it and drove under carport with only lots of noise and no damage! Thanx again Amazon, we are buddys! b"

80494,1,I have used k&n filters for many years now and the quality and ease of installation hasn't let me down yet. The installation took about 30 mins and it fit perfectly. I would recommend this filter for anyone who wants a quality filter that will last for the life of their motorcycle. Just don't forget to clean the filter periodically with k&n filter cleaner and oil.
37422,1,This is the part I needed for viper car alarm. Didnt come with instructions but I just google the product and from the instructions. Works great! well order again when needed.
40022,0,"I got this to store an extra house key on my property, should I lock myself out. I realized it wasn't the smartest idea to leave my windows unlocked to get in after my house was broken into this way.The magnet on this case is a good strong one, so I'm happy with that, but it's difficult to open and then I couldn't get it to close properly. I dropped it twice and the key flew out. I now have a rubber band wrapped around the end that opens (the magnet sticks out so the rubber band doesn't interfere with that). I also put it in a zip-locking bag, then wrapped more rubber bands around each end. The magnet is plenty strong enough to work with the plastic bag over it, but it's not exactly the slickest solution.If you can get this for pennies (including shipping) and don't mind rigging it to stay closed, it's worth it. Otherwise I'd look for something that stays closed."
124996,1,This is one of the best enhancements you can do for your truck - it works ...it runs better off idle and is snappier or the line.I would give this a five star rating but nothing is perfect...Yhe dyno sheet states almost 15 ponies increase - this is a good investment for that much of an increase - better breathing and with a programmer flash ...wellah.
140607,2,"This item performed as expected, reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with OBD-II connector. Easy to use - only 2 buttons! You might be able to find it $10 cheaper at a local store on sale, but even at the price I paid it was a BARGAIN! Cost of tool = 1 diagnostic visit to local shop."

Highly recommend if you have an extra tall front window in your vehicle."

18359,0,"Have a 2006 Chrysler Town and Country with the bolt stuck in the oil pan. I'd read about devices like this and decided to give it a try because of amazon's great customer service. I got my Mityvac quickly, and it felt like a quality product. It felt sturdy for what it was (plastic), and when I tested it using a bucket it water it worked fine. Unfortunately, I could not use it because I could not fit the smallest tube provided down my Town and Country's dipstick tube. I tried using it on my sister's 1999 Honda Civic, and it was able to fit down the tube so I guess it's really hit or miss depending on your car. If it worked for my Town and Country, I'm sure I would have given this product a 5 star review."
97604,0,"I reciently bought the AutoLoc Sl35 LBS shaved door handle/latch popper kit and found that for the most part it was a very simple install. The only two things I had a problem with was the emergency button that comes with the kit does not have a back cover where the wires screw in, so it makes it very easy for the bare wires or the posts on the button to ground out. In the kits defense I did skip the step of install a fuse between the battery and the button. I installed the button on the bottom side of the side skirt and when I put the car on a lift I immediately saw smoke rolling out from under the hood and along the bottom of the car. The back of the button was pushed up against the car and grounded out. With no door handles the hood down it took me about 3 min to get into the car. The wire burnt all the way from the battery to the button but no serious damage occurred. The other negative to this kit is the wire clamps. It took me several hours to get the wire to want to stay in the clamp without it having any slack in the cable after only a few uses. I would use the product again but not on the same make and model I tried before."
85167,1,"Product performs exactly as described in ads. Replaced year-old coolant in my K1200LT, BMW with Evans coolant. The bike not only runs cooler than average running down the road, but does not turn-on cooling fans at stop lights on 95plus degree days as it did before. Very impressive. I am switching my other bikes and cars to Evans."
144376,0,"Very Small Refrigerators ONLY!This inverter will not run a standard refrigerator or microwaves, not even close. So when they say it will run a ""small refrigerator"" they really mean one of those little soft drink coolers. It won't run a standard size ""small"" refrigerator. I also tried to start a swamp cooler with this inverter and it couldn't even start the fan. The peak watts needed to get it going just arn't there."
181011,0,"The truck box was loosely placed inside of an over-sized cardboard box with no padding. As a result, the packaging was crushed with holes and tears in it. For the amount of money I paid, I would have expected the item to be wrapped in at least a layer of bubble-wrap.Because the packaging was so terrible, the item arrived with several dents in it. 2 were on the bottom (I suppose I can deal with that). 1 was on the lip of the lid (luckily it is not too large and can probably be pounded out to look respectable). But, I guess the thinking goes, ""It's a truck box. It'll get dented with use anyway. Who cares if it shows up dented?"" Well, I do.As far as the build quality goes, the vertical seams are a little wavy as if they were aligned by hand without the use of a square. The lid is solid. The seal uses low quality, thin, open-cell foam instead of thicker, closed-cell, foam rubber (the lid is water resistant, not waterproof). The locks were aligned well, which allows the lid to close securely. I'm kind of stuck with this item as I don't want to mess with return shipping and it is the only item I could find that fits my specifications.Positives:Solid lid (even though the lip was bent a bit during shipping)Locks were alignedAverages:Welds are ok - no holes, but a few spots where the weld did not connect to both pieces of metal properly.Foam lid gasketNegatives:Shipping PackagingOverall - It is decent, just not for the price they are asking. Maybe at 25% less it is a good deal (assuming it is packaged well)."

Yes, I know this was dumb, but mistakes happen.Here is what the manual says for diagnosing problems:""The AC load will not operate. Digital display is off.""Possible Cause: ""The inverter has been connected with reverse DC input polarity.""Solution: ""Check connection to battery. The inverter has likely been damaged and needs to be repaired. Have the unit repaired (not covered under warranty).""Seriously? There is no need for the unit to blow itself up because it was hooked up wrong, that is what voltage protection circuitry is for.

Something like this looked promising as she hopefully could just park the wheel in the rack and be gone. Not so. It was a pain to assemble this rack and get it ""even"" so that it would sit well. Then cranking it into the bed was not bad for me but no way will my wife be able to heave this into the truck bed and do it herself. one of her bikes is one of those beach cruiser types with fenders. Doesn't fit. A slim road bike is no problem. Also the clamp down bar on the wheel doesn't hold well. I used bungee cords and tie downs from corner to corner like I was transporting a motorcycle. Material wise it is cheap metal prone to rust. I will wait and see how long it lasts and I will have to paint it often.for the price with free shipping I am not complaining. I can use it and will but not the ease I thought."

66848,0,The filter kit was complete. The filter adapter did not have the in and out ports marked. The directions at one point said if you do not have this (text deleted) go to step 14 and the directions stopped at step 13. Not too impressed.

55264,1,"I thought there would be gimmick to 14 hp but what I can say there is considerbly more torque and throttle response on acceleration. The install was fast and simple although color pics would help for vacuum fittings. Mine was missing the 1/4 by 4"" hose but that was less than a buck at Riebes Napa. From start to clean up was less than and hour with a couple short breaks. The unit pretty much snaps over the bottom half of stock box, swap a couple of vacuum hoses out, and screw on four hose clamps. If I thought ahead I would have assemble asa unit then just dropped in place. Really was very simple.. Waiting on MPG numbers. Mine was purchased through Amazon and delivered through Trends Auto; EXCELLENT service and DELIVERy was fast."
138773,1,I bought these for my '05 Mercury Mariner with the 3.0L V6 motor. Well packaged and arrived in good condition. Remember to check the gap and put anti seize on the threads before you install. Also remember to put dielectric grease on the COP lead from the coil before snapping the lead on the spark plug tip. Improved my gasoline mileage by about 3 mpg according to my dashboard mpg readout.

This past weekend, I accidentally inserted the tire pressure gauge at an angle and the plastic inside that pushes the tire valve pin, broke off and now it does not work. I'm a techie, but there's no need to spend extra money on a digital tire gauge when the analog ones at your local auto parts store are just as accurate, cheaper, and more durable."

We used the pipe expander to round it out again, not a big deal, but for the price i would expected it to be flawless."
16808,1,"This is an excellent product, without a doubt. I have been suffering lousy wipers that screeched and stuttered across my windshield, leaving behind streaks for a couple of years. I tried many other brands, including the fancy stuff from Tripledge and RainX, but none of them worked as well as these Trico Teflon blades. I hope they hold up through a couple of seasons.I am a little puzzled about Amazon's shipping practices. They sent everything in my order in separate boxes, each the size of a bread box; I bought 4 blades plus one other item, and they came in 5 very large boxes. One of these boxes would have been enough to hold all 5 items that I ordered. If Amazon had shipped them all in 1 box, they would have saved themselves a lot of money, and wasted a lot less cardboard and packaging. There must be more cost effective way for Amazon to ship stuff."

112307,1,"Hi All.We have been using a Mr Heater, and a Wave #6 Propane Heater, for about 8 years now. The only time you notice any smell at all, is the very first time your fire it up. Its just that new smell that you noitce. It goes away very quickly. Since we do almost nothing but Boon-Docking, ( No Hook-Ups at all ) we never, ever use our RV's Furance at all. First of all, because it will suck down one Battery per night. And second an RV Furance at best is maybe 40% to 50% effective, which means it really sucks down the Propane. And the last issue with any RV Furance is that they make a whole lot of noise all night long. Where as the Mr Heater and the Wave #6 Propane Heater is totally silent and use's no power at all. You can either Permantely Mount the Wave Heaters or use a Leg-kit and use the wave #6 as a Portable.As mentioned, you must keep your Wave Heater's Pad, Covered and Clean all of the time, or you will poision it for sure. I have met other RV'er who hhave used the very same Wave #6 or the Wave #8 for almost 20 years wiht no problems. We also have never had a problem either. Take care of your propane Heater and it will take care of you. You can have it repaired, but it cost almost as much to just buy a Brand New Wave #6 Heater, and start with a new Warranity. The Mr Heater is a good Propane Heater also, but it is only good to about 6500 feet, and it does put out a liitle bit more Carbon Monixide than the Wave #6 does, which is almost nothing, compaird to the Wave #6, and is good up to 12,000 ft. Others have mentioned Moisture issues. If you vent properly, you can easily manage this. We used both of these Propane Heaters in our last 5er. And now in our 34 ft Class A Motorhome. The Wave #6 is tapped into the Motorhome's Low Pressure System. I use two 12 ft Low Pressure Propane Hoses connected together. So I can move it any where I want it to be in our Motorhome. Our Motorhome is not what you call an All Season RV. But just the Wave #6 Propane Heater has keep us very comfortable down into the singal digit numbers in the winter. In cold weather Boon-Docking, a Wave #6 Propane Heater can and does extend your time that you can stay out and enjoy yourself and the winter time. If for any rreason that ours should ever quit working, we will buy another one for sure. I do make sure our Motorhomes Furance does work properly, for just in case of an emergency only. Good Luck. Happy Travels"
73758,1,This is a great deal on a well known air filter. Anyone who is a gear head knows who K&N is. Can't beat the price either. To get a superior air filter that will help your bike breath better for only $15 more than a stock OEM filter is a no brainer. Came fast and fit perfectly. My only complaint is that no where on the box does it say its already oiled and ready to go. Had to find that out on the internet. Otherwise I had no regrets.
6918,1,"I bought this winch to pull my 12 foot cataraft from steep river banks onto my little 10 foot trailer. Works like a charm. The winch's 1200 pound pulling capacity and 20 foot nylon strap are more than enough. Price is amazing, especially when you consider that many winches come without a strap. I've found no drawbacks - perhaps the winch is a little noisy, but no big deal. Comes with mounting bolts, but you will need to make or buy a mounting post if you plan to attach to a trailer."
109447,2,"These shocks compressed without almost any pressure, I could pull them all the way out then push them down with my pinky finger.

I have a 06 Dodge Ram and gonna keep the old ones on for a while till I find something better, maybe some Bilstein."
131762,1,Installed this filter on my lawn tractor engine a 27 hp Briggs professional. The old filter was hard to get off I had to use a large pipe wrench to remove it. Ouch!! But the new filter fit and works fine. Shipped fast and was packed well..

19357,1,"This is a fun addition to our RV. Many campgounds and RV parks do not allow open wood burning. Always a dissipointment for us as we love to sit around a natual camfire. It's always fun to roast hotdogs and marshmellows. That's when we break out this little firepit in a can. The unit is small with some artificial, but fairly natural looking logs; much like a gas fireplace in your home. All you do is unlatch three latches, udjust the logs; although we did find that the logs didn't match up well with the holes and pegs that were on them; however it made little difference how you stcked those logs on the bottom ones. You then unwind the gas hose which is wound around the stand,under the pit and attache it by hand to a Propane tank which you can put up to eight feet away. The unit is mostly for the atmosphere. It puts out a litte heat, but it's not going to keep you warm on a cold night. And we miss the crackling of the wood. (you can hook up your I-pod and play fire sounds) The unit overall works great. You can adjust the flame from low to high but the higher you go, the louder the hiss of the propane. We found that a medium flame was good. We bought a small bag of Rockwool and put some small pieces below the logs for the extra look of burning embers. You may be able to cook a hotdog over it, but we choose not to because it appears the grease would make a mess of the logs and they don't look easy to clean. All in all, I think it's a great idea and it works well. Do keep in mind that you will have to haul an extra propane tank as, even with an adapter, I don't think it would run long on small tanks."
3210,0,"Watch out! If you're installing this on a 4X4, don't do what I did - I installed it with the grease fitting in place and realized it way too late - it interferes with the axle U-joint hub and I had a 50-50 chance it would be in the right place to allow me to remove it. I was in the wrong 50%. Bummer so at least I greased it but I had to shear it off and seal the hole with RTV. So happens that item 14 int he little instruction sheet that came with it warns you about this problem but that clue is nowhere else to be found and I wish I had caught it sooner so I'll be doing this job again in a year or 2 since I cannot grease this joint again."

33750,0,Heats rapidly for sub zero weather but definitely needs a better way to attach it to the seat. The elastic straps and clips are not stable enough to retain the cushion and it balls up when getting in. The product does what it's advertised to do. Needs better retainers.

When I tried to use it for the first time for real it refused to work. It was all but dead, the cute little lite worked but I was more interested in checking my tire pressure then lighting up the afternoon sky. When I brought it into the house it came back to life. My guess is that it does not like to work in the cold. There is something to be said for the tried and true manual tire gauge."
58716,1,Well this is what my Honda powered Craftsman lawn mower requires and it does the job just fine. NGK is what came out and NGK is what went in. The old plug lasted me over two years and to be honest it didn't show fouling or too much wear on the electrode.

130413,2,"The product that was delivered for a 1999 4Runner does not fit a 1999 4Runner. Most annoying, however, is that the blades are shipped one blade per box; i.e., you have to explicity order two blades to get a pair. I should have read the marketing materials more closely, but it never occurred to me that Amazon would not ship a pair. One wiper blade is like a left shoe without the right. I would have returned it, but the time and effort to return exceeds the price of the single blade. Perhaps my sizing problem was just a rare occurrence, but based on my experience, I can't recommend this product.Valeo 900-17-1B All-Season ULTIMATE Wiper Blade - 17"""
21144,0,"I was hoping this would be a viable option to make my car horn louder without having to invest in an expensive air horn setup. Installation would have been simpler if the instructions were more clear. If you plan on replacing a stock horn, this one may require clipping and stripping a little bit of wire to crimp the connectors. Otherwise soldering is an alright option, but inconvenient if you aren't satisfied with the performance.I bought this one to replace the stock horn on my Jeep Wrangler. It didn't have a loud horn to start with and this one is barely louder at best. I know for a fact that I can shout louder than my horn still can, so if you're looking into this for your car thinking it's going to make a big difference, think again. If you want to upgrade the horn for a motorcycle, this is a good, cheap place to start as it's much louder than the stock horn on my Honda Shadow (which was wimpy at best before).If you want loud, either look elsewhere, or invest the extra money and get both the high and low tones...from what I've been told, together they get quite loud and annoying, which is just what the doctor ordered. *Evil Laugh*"
186964,0,Had no idea the difficulty it would take two people to pull and tug then staple on. It's nice quality but a little difficult to assemble
67934,1,79 F250 4x4 6.6L I bought a new dual wheel trailer and my old brake controller would not handle the hydraulic brakes on the trailer correctly. The Tekonsha P3 was a snap to install in place of my old controller and works great with the hydraulic brakes. Setup was easy and I like the ability to have more than one trailer preset in memory.
174470,1,You can remove car dust in just a couple of minutes with this duster. Would not recommend for cleaning cars that are very dirty or have mud or bugs on exterior. But it's a great product for its purpose- removing dust.
168497,1,Great value for the money. Fit like a glove and was delivered very fast. The binding was well done and sewn well. One suggestion is to have a heal pad option. That's where it'll wear out! I'd buy them again.
174961,1,Using it in our Genuine Rattler 110 and Yamaha Zuma with no issues or concerns. Seems to help reduce the smoke from the scooter that is infrequently ridden.

31687,2,I used this l.e.d scanner with my car alarm and it last only 2 weeks! It burned out fast!
170401,2,"I purchased two of these about a year ago. They initially charged up fine, and when I happened to need to use one of them, it worked just as advertised. However, a year later, both are dead--neither one will charge. I've tried a new AC adapter, but that doesn't work. From what I can see on the other reviews, there must be some very cheaply made circuitry inside that fries after a while."
97154,0,Result was not that great as expected. Claiming that product is really a big improvement over OEM fog lights. Slight improvement only. Wish they could have at least have a rating between OEM vs. product being purchased.
125648,0,I guess they'll work ok. Easy to install but you have to take the wheels off to drill the holes
131209,1,Good value for the money. It really saves bending and stretching when washing a vehicle. The brush really gets into hard to reach nooks and crannies common on most cars.
184651,0,"These plug wires work fine but I was a little disappointed with the build quality. The top of one of the boots just separated from the rest of the boot when I removed it one time. I think the quality should be a little higher for ""premium"" spark plug wires."

133549,1,"I used this before on a previous car and after 6 years, it still looks great. I just bought more to do the trim on my Avalanche. The summer sun in AZ faded this plastic quickly. I plan to take a ""before"" and ""after"" photo to post here. I highly recommend this product. As for the other user's comment on application... it's always a good idea to start the liquid on a test piece of anything....to get the initial flow. That's just common sense when dealing with any product that is labeled permanent. I used the sponge applicator on the bulk of the area needed, but then used a q-tip for getting into small crevasses. Even a make-up sponge bought at any drug store, can be used for these hard to reach places. You could even cut the make-up sponge to a smaller size. This product has brought new life back to my vehicles and I will purchase again in the future when needed. Well worth the money! Please see recent photo updates above."
125911,1,I used these pads with my Porter-Cable 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher and Astro Pneumatic 4607 5&#34; PU Velcro Backing Pad to remove some deeper scratches and blemishes and after a couple of attempts all the scratches were gone - use a quality compound like the Meguiar's Ultra Cut Compound 105/205 and you'll get a great finish!
161898,1,Quick Delivery. Item was as described. No problems with this seller. Would do business again.
16916,1,"Installed on a 2011 Ford Ranger after having the solid plastic one on previous Ranger. Very nice product and fit was perfect. Things do not slip around in the back. The bed is padded so makes it easy on the knees. The padding fits right into the dips of the bed making a smooth top. The hardest part of the installation was zipping the two pieces (wall and bottom) together, and that wasn't bad. Installed the Velcro, put the whole thing in the back of the pickup and then rolled up bottom to pull the sticky cover off the velcro, and pressed down. Really easy. Only had on a few weeks now and really looks nice. It fits under the side rails and does not go over the top of the front rail or tailgate. I removed my tie down hangers and reinstalled them afterwards. That was a fairly easy operation. Overall, I really like it better so far than the previous solid plastic Ford bed liner."
152739,1,"I have used naval jelly for years to get rid of rust. It chemically dissolves the rust and turns the rusted surface a dark brown.I have also used Rust-Oleum Rust Reformer, which also works very well (and I have reviewed it on Amazon), so let me explain how I decide when to use one rather than the other.The Rust Reformer sprays on just like black paint. That works great, for example, when spraying my car's rusted trailer hitch receiver, which was black when new, and looks new again after being sprayed with the Rust Reformer. Using naval jelly would make the receiver look multi-colored--black where there was no rust, and dark brown where the naval jelly dissolved rust.On the other hand, I have patio lounge chairs with white painted frames and beach chairs with aluminum frames where naval jelly is perfect to use because I can wipe the excess off the surrounding area without discoloring the frames.Although this naval jelly comes in a sprayer, you can unscrew the top and apply it with a paint brush. For some applications that may be preferable, such as a vertical surface where you don't want gel dripping down.Update February 27, 2011: I recently discovered VHT rust convertor on Amazon (and have reviewed it), which is a liquid that sprays on clear and converts rust the same as naval jelly. Sometimes I find it more convenient to use a liquid spray rather than a gel (like on my patio and beach chairs), while other times I don't want a spray dripping all over the place and use naval jelly (like on my boat engine). Both products work fine. It's just a matter of personal preference."
53335,0,"Intallation was more difficult than it needed to be because there was no female hex head on the tie rod end. The part that it replaced had the hex head, so some parts do have this feature, which allows you to tighten the nut and suck the mating surfaces into contact. Without this you meed to get the tie rod end mating solidly with the pitman arm and idler arm before you tighten it."
171003,2,"I bought this hammock about a year ago for my German Shepherd and I've been pretty disappointed with it. The fabric itself is holding up well, but that's the only good thing about it. After not even a month of use, the zipper broke, so now we have a permanent hole for hair and dirt to fall through, which defeats the purpose of the hammock. And even though my dog is really big, he rides calmly in the car, so he did not break the zipper. The zipper is just too small and cheap for a product like this.The grommets on the hammock are also cheap and quite thin. After a couple months of use, the fabric started tearing out of them and we had to punch in more heavy-duty grommets. Again, my dog pretty much just lays down in the car, so he wasn't bouncing around and tearing them.The headrest covers are kind of small and just barely squeeze onto the headrests in our car. The straps on the headrest covers are quite long, so we had to wrap them around a few times to keep the hammock from sagging too much. Even after that it still sags quite a bit and does not hang nearly as high as the promotional picture. And we have a Nissan Altima, so it's not a tiny car. My dog can still easily step into the front seats if he wants. It may not be such a problem for a smaller dog, but even a beagle-sized dog could easily get into the front seats with how the hammock (doesn't) fit in our car."
95174,1,The dash mat fit perfectly in my F150. All the cuts made for the vents and such were perfect. Very satisfied with this product and I highly recommend it for those who don't want to spend a lot for a dash mat.

57983,2,"I had a Yakima rack for years and it was fine. Did what a rack should do. The high price maybe was worth it, maybe not but that's up to you. The problem with this expensive system was made clear to me one day when I came out to my car and the rack was gone. Yes, I bought the expensive locks and it was locked. How could it possibly have disappeared? Turns out these clips aren't really designed to stay on so seriously. Apparently you can just jam a screw driver under the clips and pry them out from the door recess. You're thinking, but won't that scratch up the car quite badly? Yes. Yes it does. Beware this system. It's not as secure as Yakima wants you to believe. I'm just glad there was no expensive bike on it when it left. Getting better mileage now and I don't have to worry about parking garages!"
153694,0,This product probably would work okay but it would not work in my situation where I needed a sender for a classic car restoration project
125380,1,"I never liked the remotes that originally came with our RS114 remote starter. So when I saw this I knew I wanted to try it. As another person had commented, these remotes work perfectly with the older unit. Programming was very easy. On the RS114 you hold the brake through the whole process and just hold the start button on a working remote until you hear the parking lights flash once. Then push the stop button on the new remote. If it worked the parking lights flash 3 times which you'll hear from the relay clicking. Let off the brake and you're done. I like the rubberized finish on these remotes and they're easy to hold. My only real complaint would be the size of the unlock button which is really small and hard to push."
172570,1,"I thought about getting a different plug, other than what came with my 2005 997; since these plugs are fairly expensive if purchased from Porsche. However, Sunset Porsche accidentally sent me a set of plugs and these arrived at the same time. The only difference is that these said Bosch on the box and the others said Porsche. They are exactly the same plug except for the extremely high Porsche markup. After my four hour stint changing the plugs; Wow what a difference! The car of course ran smoother, accelerated smoother and best of all had that musical Porsche sound! I didn't want to stop driving after changing the plugs. Anyway, if you install your own plugs and want to save a fortune, just buy these."
19297,2,"Bought this at Walmart for $300. It started easily the first 2 months. A year later the carb is leaking gas when I open the fuel shutoff valve. I work on cars all the time and checked the usual items. It is the carb, not the hoses or clamps. I went on the Devilbiss website and it is not listed as a current model. They have nothing like it now. I'll buy a Honda next time. Update - still have it 2 yrs later, runs after lots of carb cleaner (run it dry, don't trust STABIL alone)...I now have problems with poor power quality, voltage swings, poor grounding even with ground rod, and no voltage to safety ground, only 105 volts from hot to neutral. I think it fried my refrigerator computer board - I won't use the generator anymore for anything electronic or valuable."
48936,0,"What a great idea and worked great for awhile. As long as you use it light duty for blowing up pool toys or balls and even car tires. Right after I used it for my truck tires, about 50 PSI, it stopped working. Coincidence maybe but I won't be burying another one, not for $50. I need something a little more reliable and heavy duty. I it fairly good to have if you just want something for toys. Especially with the AC/DC feature."

93016,0,"This gauge was purchased believing that KD was a good brand name and the product would reflect decent quality. The product description shows the gauge to be 1.4 lbs and the shipping weight to be 4.2 oz. That's a good trick.The gauge arrived, packaged well and on time. However, there were two leaves, the .085 and .090 that were stuck together with a spot of rust?Although not a large spot and I was able to smooth it out with steel wool, stainless steel should not be corroding in any manner, especially, with what appears to be rust! I'll be getting my micrometer out tomorrow to check the accuracy of the leaves....if anything but correct, I will post an update"
74183,1,"I've been eyeing this one for a long time on other sites as well as here. Came in very quickly and I was immidiately surprised how small it was. Apart from the size it works perfectly fine. Im not sure what other reviewers are referring to when they mentioned a wave effect, mine has no such thing."
175826,0,"These shades do only a marginal job of keeping my car cool. The fabric is very thin and doesn't appear to have any backing to repel the heat from the car. I think that the next time, I will consider a rigid shade, or something that is more opaque."

149690,0,Easy install. Good instructions. Quality product that fits perfect to vehicle. Really fast shipping from Amazon. WeatherTech packaging was great too. Yes would purchase from Amazon these WeatherTech brand again. Thanks!Do have an issue with the in channel install. Here in the desert Southwest...we have a lot of dust. The dust / dirt gets in between the window and the window deflectors. Sounds awful to hear the window go down...and think it might be scratching the window. They are install properly...but the dust / dirt here is pretty intense. That is why the 3 star rating.
181865,1,"I bought this for my 99 Civic Si so I could bring my bike to the beach. Part of the installation includes inserting a bracket in to the rear frame and feeding a carriage bolt through the bracket. Could not get the bolt through the bracket because of its length. In order to get it through the bracket and frame,I had to grind an 1/8"" off two sides so I could tip the bracket up to get the bolt through. This was after I called customer service at Curt who were friendly and did try to help. They sent me new brackets just in case I had to return the hitch if my ""modification"" didn't work. After getting it installed, I must say that I'm happy with my purchase. It doesn't detract from the look of the car and does what I need it to do."
2450,2,"The Sears DieHard Platinum (AGM) blows away the Optima Yellow Top.

188464,2,"Imagine giving this device to your 16 year old. Imagine he encounters circumstances to put it to use. Now imagine it fails to work. How would you feel about your gift?I ordered 6 of these as Christmas stocking-stuffers. Fortunately, my 16 year old tested the glass breaking function of his on a piece of scrap hard plastic.No matter how hard we tried we couldn't get the pin to 'pop'. The barrel simply moved in and out with no effect.I handed him another. The pin popped as it should but then remained stuck in the extended position. In actual use that would have meant one try to break the glass and then the device would have been useless.I tested the remaining 4 and they did, in fact, function as advertised and demonstrated. I don't think a device like this ought to have what basically amounts to a 33% failure rate on the 6 I purchased.If you buy them, TEST them. Then consider installing the full-sized hammer as a back-up."
130954,1,This type of item is difficult to find and most boaters do not use it but it will save your transom from damage and also give it added strength . I have used this item on several boats and have been completely satisfied.

95390,2,I bought this as part of my husband's birthday gift. When I opened the box I was dismayed at how cheap and terrible it looked. I had to order another key chain from a specialty company immediately. This looked like it should have cost $5. I was embarrased to give it and disgusted to have wasted so much on something so crappy.

135954,2,"This review is for the wheelskins that fits a 1997 Toyota 4Runner steering wheel. The Wheelskin came quickly and was packaged appropriately. From there, it went downhill. It says it takes about 1 hour to install. I'm pretty good with my hands but it took just under 2 hours to install the cover. Also - just because it says that it fits a 97 4Runner does not mean it is an exact fit. The wheelskins covers the steering wheel but it does not cover any of the leather spokes on the steering wheel. I have two spokes on my wheel that are also in leather. So what you get in the end is a new cover on the round part of the steering wheel but the inner spokes (which are also leather on my vehicle) are not covered. The end product looks sloppy and cheap.The leather quality out of the box looks nice but I noticed within a few weeks that the shiny sheen on the new leather started to peel from normal use. It is irritating because you can feel the leather peeling under your hands and it leaves a gritty feeling on the steering wheel. Once it peels you have these unfinished patches on the wheel in areas where you hold the wheel. Again - it looks sloppy and cheap. That said - I dont think there are very many other good options out there. My dealer said they would replace the steering wheel cover for about $100 but they hire that out to a local shop who probably uses a similar product as wheelskins.If you do buy this, get a good set of gloves and a good thimble for threading the needle through the wheelskin. If you want it to look good you need to tighten the leather thread with each stroke and that takes a toll on your hands. I used gloves and my hands were still raw when I finished. Plus, pushing the needle through the holes is brutal after the first 5 strokes. I ended up using a penny to push the needle through and that helped.Overall - I think Wheelskins is not worth the price. I would have appreciated it much more if the seller made it clear in the product description what you can expect to get. It said it fit my 97 4Runner...and it did, but it is not to be considered a factory replacement.I would not buy this again."
36731,0,"These are decent shop rags for the price. They are pretty thin and have to be folded or balled up to do any significant clean-up. However, for wiping off light grease, debris, etc. I'd say they are worth it."
26014,1,The item was shipped promptly and included programming instructions. The programming of the remote took approximately two minutes. Works great. Would buy again.
95021,0,"The original equipment driver's side mat on a CR-V is held in place (avoiding the dreaded mat-creeping-up-under-the-pedals problem) by clips embedded in the floor, attachng to clip holes in the mat. The product here is shaped correctly, but does not have clip holes and is not long enough to add your own holes and use the clips. So it tends to creep forward over time. But it's difficult to find front-only mat sets that fit a CR-V and the price of these is reasonable so all in all I'm fairly satisfied."

19517,2,"I purchased the battery from Sears about 3 years ago. The battery had a 3 year warranty, Sears no longer carried the battery and would not exchange it. I purchased a new one figuring Optima would refund and warranty their exchange. They wanted me to send the battery in, wait 3 weeks for warranty processing, and would not refund my money for the new purchased battery. They didn't care that I purchased another one of their products and did care if I was without a car for 3 weeks.Based on Warranty policy and the fact that it only lasted 2.75 years I would never buy nor recommend.OPTIMA SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
112321,2,"I could not believe how poorly made this productor is. The attachment holes on the heater body do not align up to those on the legs, furthermore, when the bolts were tightened, the nuts fell off from the retaining clips to prevent them from spinning, making the legs useless. The fit and finish of metal work is so poor the heater looks like a bad lemon car made in the 1980s. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Looks like Cameco has been making and selling junks over the years."
6963,1,"These covers were just what my 2000 Ford Ranger with 198,000 miles needed. The door side of the driver's seat had been worn down from repeated ins and outs over the years while the rest of the truck is in very good shape. New seat covers would make a big difference and did. After installing, my only problem was the small cover that goes on top of the center console door. I tried a dozen times to get it on but it was just a bit too small. I called the seller who told me to call the manufacturer; I felt a bit brushed off but I guess that was the best thing to do anyway. The manufacturer was great, asked me to measure my top and sent me two brand new covers, one with an elastic border and one similar to the one that comes with the set. The covers are machine washable and should last as long (or longer) than this truck's lifetime."
116907,0,I received the gauge in a timely manner and have only used it once and worked well. I would want to see how this performs over a longer period of time before I could give a more accurate review.
95451,2,"Device arrived as expected. I used it the first time, on my car, and it worked as expected however I used it the second time about 2 minutes later and it failed at half it's rated capacity. Being an excellent mechanic I disassembled the device and corrected the flaw. I'm none too satisfied with the as sold condition of the device. Seems like the seller had an issue with the device and promptly sold it rather than fix it properly or return it to the manufacturer for replacement. Fortunately I have repaired the device and it now works properly. Were it not for my own mechanical ability this device would have been utterly useless."
118254,1,"The gauge seems to work well. Unfortunately, I haven't checked its accuracy against anything. It seems to be of reasonable quality but wasn't overly impressed considering the cost. I would recommend buying the rubber protector."
65499,0,"I had hoped this brush would provide stiffer bristles as most snow brushes I use end up with deformed bristles (bent over and misshapen) after a season or two. I feel fairly certain that will be the case with this one as well.The handle is very sturdy and will hold up for many years. While it may seem like a great idea to have a longer handle for a smaller vehicle (the thought being that I can clean my entire roof and hood from one side without having to go to both sides to clean the whole thing) it turns out that the longer handle is really a longer lever and it takes more force to swing an arc of the brush as a result. I end up holding the brush further up the handle (as if &#34;choking up&#34; on a baseball bat) largely negating the length advantage.I am very glad for the scraper to be on the end opposite the brush, I have always thought it to be silly to have the scraper on that end because of the potential to scratch things unintentionally while brushing."

What do you expect out of something for this price?"
153387,1,The Flyscreen works well on the Ural patrol. The Ural motorcycles are designed in a manner that has the rider sitting higher than most current mc frames so the Flyscreen directs some air up a bit to reduce the pressure when riding into stiff head winds. It fits OK but not as close to the head light as I would like. Seems well built and finished nicely. National should make a version with black metal parts rather than chrome.
136911,0,I baught this item and had them professionally installed. The ball flanges leak really bad so exhaust shop had to cut them off and put new ones on. Good product but be prepared to spend a little extra cash on new flanges.

24019,2,I failed smog because my O2 sensors didn't work. I bought Bosch sensors and failed again; the reults were worse. I then bought Denso sensors and passed. The smog guy told me never buy Bosch for Japanese cars. Fortunately Amazon allowed me to return the Bosch sensors. But buying Bosch sensors probably wasted about 8 hours of my time.
76496,0,"If you are looking for a cheap way to cover your bike this cover will work. If you have a windshield on your bike the treatment on the material will leave a rainbow glare that tough to get off, but overall it's not a bad cover."
179931,1,"I ordered the Tru Tech DR46T ignition coils but received these instead for whatever reason. That's why it doesn't show as an Amazon verified purchase.The ones I received were gray colored, not black like the one in the listing. Before installing them I checked the resistance between the terminals and they were within specs (between 700-900 ohms.)I installed them in my 98 Saturn SL2 approximately one month ago and have put around 1,000 miles on them. They have performed without a hitch so far. I will update the review if I encounter any problems with them in the future."
130856,1,The air intake works great. I bought it for my 2010 Dodge Challenger SRT8. You wont notice a whole bunch but you notice a little bit. The install was pretty easy also.

I highly recommend if you are looking to buy a air intake.
71500,1,The clay bar kit worked very well. It removed a lot of grit from my cars finish. The car was very smooth after the treatment. It made waxing so much easier. Very pleased with the finish of my car after using the kit. Only negative to offer is the price. Kind of expensive for what you get. Would like to see it cheaper or add some more clay to the kit.

166772,1,The price for two shocks is unbelievable - under $5. But they were packed in with bushings and washers and installed perfectly on my 94 Pontiac TransSport. I used them in place of the airlift shocks it was built with since I don't plan to do any more heavy towing with the old girl. The ride is good and I needed some control since the 2nd set of air shocks totally lost all damping.
125120,1,They are perfect and look great on my 2008 Dodge Charger. Very pleased. I would order them again in a heart beat.
170589,1,The product came in the amount of time it was supposed to and it is in great shape! I have nothing to complain about.Very Satisfied
165154,0,Don't get me wrong its a good product I like it but with a few upgrades it'll make a great product like the music mode doesn't exactly follow the music the tubes can use better quality plastic if the lights where a Tad bit brighter it'll be golden and if they added were you can have a single color in music mode that would've been great well I just installed it only time will tell if this product was worth the penny
13002,2,"I have used this product before and it is a very good product.So why the 1-star rating? This item ships with the sprayer already installed. Spray heads are NOT leak proof and should not be allowed to remain on its side or upside down. There is no way to insure that a package containing a liquid will remain upright during shipment.This item was placed inside a plastic bag which was not leak proof. The item and bag were then placed in a box with my other items and shipped to me. Two ounces of this product leaked out and onto my other items in the box.The proper way to package this item for shipment is to remove the spray head and replace it with a seal and a screw-on cap. The sealed bottle and the spray head can then be shipped with minimal risk of leakage. See the pictures I posted under the item picture.Will I continue to use this item? Yes, but I will purchase it locally."
155600,2,"This product is easy to apply and easy to wipe off. But, on black cars especially, it does not give a nice deep glossy or ""wet look"" shine. It leaves more of a streaky oily finish.I switched over to yellow carnuba wax and the difference was night and day. I have a full bottle that I no longer use and it's just sitting in the garage collecting dust.If you have a black car, and stick with carunba wax instead of synthetics. Meguiar's to make great products, but this one fails to impress.I get a better shine off of Meguiar's cleaner wax than this NXT stuff.But a friend introduced me to Mothers pure carnuba wax and I have since made a switch in brand. I mean the shine you get with this stuff is just insane."
136929,0,"The lock is definately sturdy albeit quite heavy. The plastic body that wraps the metal isn't durable. Mine is already breaking off and I only used it once. Needless to say, I am not impressed with how long that part lasted. I will probably end up breaking it off and just continue using the lock without it. Other than that I would expect that it will protect my bike. After all, I could only give a full review if someone actually tried to steal my bike."

I don't use armorall, but I know it won't cause cracks.All these protectant sprays serve the same purpose as car wax; to add a thin layer of substance to sacrifice to the wrath of the sun.Everything else is just snake oil."
102019,1,"I purchased a set for my husband last year and for my 1997 Toyota 4-runner this year and just installed them. I bought the black and cream front bucket seats only and they look wonderful. Very easy to install and in fact was easier than in my husbands car so not sure if the product has been redone. My drivers seat was becoming very worn looking and now looks like I have a new car. The set I bought last January for my husband still looks very nice. He hauls guys around a lot and if they get dirty, just wipe them off. I would highly recommend them."
97689,0,"I bought this specifically to refill the auto trans in my car.The inside seal isn't too good, evidently. I did get a good bit of bubbles and air along with the transmission fluid. A MUCH better plan is to have NO bubbles at ALL in such a case.The seal between the hose piece I used (NOT the included hose due to its size) was fine..IT wasn't leaking, and the other end of the hose was WELL into the oil container..no air sucking there.This thing is so-so."
132792,1,This part was a perfect fit on my 93 Civic DX Hatchback. It even looks beefier than the stock unit.
154782,0,"It is a great, simple cover. Only problem is that you have to sew it together. It is kind of a pain but it looks sleek if you do it right."
102326,1,Just what I was looking for. It left my tires looking xtra black and shiny. Ive had it on my tires for about a week now & you can still see the dark black look it left. Shipping was also good. I highly recommend it!
172062,1,"These are a quality set of foglights for the money, in spite of Pilot not being one of the 'big' names. They are really bright with good reflectors and the price was great and received quick free standard shipping."
1078,1,"I have these floor mats and ue them in my GMC pick up. This is the second set in this vehicle and the only floor mats that hold up to the abuse I dish out - - truck has 330,000+ miles on it. These are the toughest floor mats you find and will hold the entire contents of a 44 oz. drink when spilled on the floor."
68220,2,"I purchased this muffler through Amazon in July 2010 as a direct-fit replacement for my 4Runner. It bolted on very easily and sounded just like the original factory muffler that had rusted out after fourteen years. The problem started when I went to replace the downflow O2 sensor last week. The studs that hold the sensor to the pipe had completely rusted to the point where I could crumble the threads with my fingers. The studs are now completely useless; the only thing holding the sensor to the pipe is the rusted mass.When I called Walker to inquire about the warranty they directed me to Amazon, saying any replacement would be handled through them. A little strange but we'll see how that goes."
141685,2,"My headline says it all. I have a brass ice scraper that I bought 15 years ago. I felt like it was time to replace it. What a bummer to see this weak, little scraper. Disappointed is how I feel."
152504,0,Easy fitting with the brackets from my old Memphis fats screen. Less buffetting than the latter but more wind noise.
76756,1,"I'm a smart, able-bodied person who can do most things I set my mind to, but these things are very difficult to apply without leaving bubbles underneath, which is just fugly.My windows were too small, too, so the material has to be cut to size, which was also a pain in the butt.I gave up and bought one of the Eddie Bauer ones that just grabs the top of the window with clips and pulls down like a shade. Much easier to apply and move."
94182,1,"Good price compared to retai, good service - arrived before expected, good product - fits as advertised - no ties."
145837,2,"From the picture I thought the grooves of these mats would be more pronounced. They are practically flat, have stained easily and don't really trap dirt at all. Should have known from looking at them when they first arrived that they weren't going to work and returned them then. Too late now, so I guess they were a waste of money."
179481,0,"At $288 it was a great price with free super saver shipping. They are delicate panels. The plastic around one of them already broke when it hit -10 below zero. I am waiting to see what happens next. The charger is very cheapo and delays the charge, but this was explained in the item description. It will run a boat trolling motor just fine on a sunny day hooked directly to the motor. Can't complain too much, unless the glass starts beaking too. THE SOLAR PANELS THEMSELVES ARE SUPER DELICATE and break very easily. Wind will blow the thing over with just a breeze. Quality doesn't come cheap. It's a great starter if you are looking to experiment into solar energy like me. I use it to light my chickens coops."
61080,1,"The price isn't the cheapest, but it's better than my OEM Ducati filters, and seems to work just as well. The nut on the filter is an added bonus, though very easy to round off."
114789,0,I have not yet used this product. We got it in preparation of our Christmas trip to Minnesota. The size is perfect for the cargo carrier that we purchased. It appears to be made from quality material and it came with tied down straps to attach to the carrier. We believe that this will be an idea solution for a weather proof container for our items that will not fit in SUV.
138808,2,this spray gun is junk. the only thing it was good for was blow bubbles
154076,1,"This stuff is great. I gave this a rating of 4 and not 5 becuase I also use meguiars wax (which ever is cheaper) and it seems like the Mothers doesn't last as long, but it does go on easy and come off nicely."
55827,1,"First and foremost the cover works, it breathes, yet after a thunderstorm no water was sitting on the camper top.It looks nice, it was a good fit on the pop up. And held securly with the tie downs.Tree sap, leaves and such hosed right off cover, while the camper remained shiny white under it.After years of using Amazon one other thing is good to know. They have the best prices around!"

114816,1,"Bought the cargo bag to go with cargo carrier on back of our SUV. Went on vacation with wife, daughter, son-in-law, and two grandkids. Got everybody's bag in with no trouble. Traveled through snow and rain. Not even damp inside the cargo bag. Really good quality construction and more than adequate tie downs. Received on time as promised. Have used it several times since. This is a great value!"
188679,1,"As advertised, this towel was used to dry my whole car without having to ring it out once. Its an average size car, BMW 325. When I first held it I must admit I thought it was really thin, but when I tried it out I loved it."
173462,1,"Ordered this charger as I had several batteries dead or dying - used it to charge a lawn mower, aircraft, and car battery and it worked wonderfully. The fully automatic system selects the charging level when you apply power after placing charging cables on battery but you can increase/decrease level as desired. Once charging is complete it switches over to maintenance mode and trickle charge. Glad I purchased this product because I don't have to jump off the lawn equipment every week now!"
136846,0,"The header itself appears to be well designed and made, however the extender from the header collector to the exhaust system doesn't fit a stock Mazda B2200 series exhaust. I had to cut off the end that attaches to the stock exhaust 1 3/4"" from the end and use 2"" flexible exhaust tubing to connect it to the collector."
34625,1,I prefer the other ones that I had purchased previously but these are good quality. They hold shap as do my less expensive ones
109326,2,"Problems that I have encountered with this gauge:1 - Hose is too stiff. Storing it in its case doesn't help straightening it out either.2 - The Gauge doesn't work in cold weather when taking readings during the winter months.3 - The lever on the chuck that locks the hose to the valve stem literally fell apart.3 - Good luck finding the recommended replacement batteries.The only positive thing I have to say about this product is that the chuck is deeper than on most othe tire gauges which is a plus. But the extremely stiff hose negates this advantage.Don't waste your money on this product. I replaced it with a similar gauge made by Slime and that gauge has more functions built into it than this one and it has a much more flexible hose and replacement batteries are readily available for it. And its less than half the cost of this one. BTW this is another ""Made in China"" piece of junk."
33486,0,"Product is okay, couldn't use it on my steering wheel to small. Some of the patterns not facing the correct angle."
114337,0,this press is adequate for small projects. It's not the sturdiest press out there but for the price its good. the only thing that i didn't like about it was the fact that there is a lot of play in the press bar and it will wiggle left and right as it situates itself on the object you're pressing. this can sometimes cause an incorrect amount of pressure on the side of the object you're working on. just get a piece of wood and jam it between the press bar and the side of the press to keep it from wiggling.
81568,2,"The 89590 Gauge Cover is WAY to big for the 2343 Tire Gauge. Amazon states "" Frequently Bought Together"" is the 2343 AutoMeter and the Moroso 89590 Gauge cover. The AutoMeter tire gauge comes from Amazon, the cover comes from an other vendor. I don't know who is at fault, but I am not happy. It is too much work to send the products back, so I consider the cover as a loss. I have to mention that the cover is well made."
170563,2,"I bought one of these during the winter of '06-07. It stopped working shortly after I bought it (would not charge). I called Black & Decker and they sent me a replacement. Ditto -- did not work, and failed to work exactly the same way as the first. Having only so much storage space in my house for unusable lead batteries, I did not request a third, but instead got new car batteries for both cars, and a good set of jumper cables for each -- which I never needed to use during the much more severe winter of '07-'08."
124026,1,The product description was accurate. Everything I hoped it would be. Install was easy and it fit like a glove. I can definitely feel a increase in performance. There's no going wrong with this air filter.
112436,2,"This is my third truck I have installed Air Lift brand on. As in the past I like the end result but I am very unimpressed with the directions and quality of the kit. The directions bounce all over so plan on reading them several times. If you have a Silverado, plan on ignoring some of the specific instructions. They call for placing a thick spacer washer to level the upper bracket - well, after trying and uninstalling the bracket I called their technical folks they told me very casually to NOT install the washer - I must have a different truck.The white nylon installation tool is handy - if they would only thread it properly. Instead of rolling the threads they should cut them properly so you could actually get the guide nuts on without wrenches. They do provide all the hardware and even a few extra's so when you loose parts inside the frame rail there are more to choose from. I had to cut off a few of the bolts as they were way too long.Even though they don't call for any specialized tools, having a set of crows foot open end wrenches that can be calibrated to your torque wrench would be handy, or you need to be cleaver enough to find a way to torque the bottom bolt going into the plastic base of the bladder. I know about that because of truck number 1.They don't provide enough wire tie wraps for the hoses so you'll need to get extras.I must add that allowing four hours for install, calling tech help and fixing a few minor things is more appropriate than the 2 hours they suggest.All that considered, the ride is great and they do exactly what they are supposed to do"

31319,0,"""Hi, I bought your 13244 Class III Trailer Hitch Receiver for my 2006 Jeep Liberty Sport on Amazon.comJust so you know - it cost me 9 dollars and something (almost 10 bucks) to go to the hardware store to buy the CORRECT BOLTS. The ones included in with your hitch are the WRONG ONES.You say on the instruction sheet that they are 12MM, but they were too big just barely.I went to the hardware store and bought (4) 10MM bolts and (4) 7/16 bolts - which fit. The welded nuts on the underside of a 2006 Jeep Liberty Sport are 7/16.The receiver, carton, and instructions all did have 13244 model number on it - and your hitch is fair once I got it installed. But, I was disappointed that your bolts/ hardware did not fit correctly and that I had take the time and money to go get the right bolts.""Therefore, I give this 4 out of 5 stars.Above was original review - I changed it to 3 stars after Curt's basic don't care response.Today I heard back from Curt - They offered NO compensation nor any real concernthat the enclosed hardware was incorrect. Just told me to check how tight the correct bolts were from time to time, because one of their hitches had come offand wrecked the guys boat ?The obvious safety instructions that come with the hitch and common sense would tell one to check the bolts from time to time for safety.I was disappointed at Curt's response and in the future would try either Reese or Valley hitches 1st."
48344,0,"I have used it for about a week now. It is much better than the one I got from Walmart. The major issue I see is that the pressure gauge on this machine is rather small and it will be hard for you differentiate between 27psi versus 29psi without using an external gauge. My Toyota Camry calls for 29psi and my other car asks for 34psi front and 36psi rear. It was impossible for me to read 34 vs 36 psi on this machine's gauge.Tip: To get the best out of this machine - get a good external mechanical pressure gauge with a relief valve (you can get a decent one for under $10 at Walmart). Then set the dial on this machine to be slightly over (2-3 psi more) the pressure required (I set it to 30psi when filling my Camry which needs 29 psi). Fill the tires with air using the machine. Then use the external gauge to measure the pressure and release the air using its relief valve until the pressure is at the desired reading. Works like a charm for me.Other than this, the machine is quite nice and with a 2 year warranty it is a good buy. Amazon's price was amongst the lowest I could find."

It's easy to bend them back; however, after a few times of this I can see it eventually breaking off."

I know the rotors don't actually warp but that's the terminology everyone applies to the issue so it's just easier to use that term.Anyway, the rotors were paired up with some pads from Oreilly's and they've done an excellent job. They have the same bite as the stock setup but without the weird vibrations and jolting that accompany the warped rotors.I have used brembo rotors on one of my previous vehicles and they were excellet in that application as well. I will definitely buy them again when needed!"

Both side arm-hinges were for the same side of the cargo box so we couldn't use them.(3) The edge-hinges were very difficult to attach, and it took two of us to do it.Even if we had the right hardware to assemble the cargo box, I would not trust it to stay closed while driving over 50 MPH down the highway. My suggestion to anyone interested in buying a cargo box is to buy a more substantial box (heavier) and ideally one that is already assembled! Don't buy this one.Post Script: When we took our son to college, we squeezed everything into the car and did not use the cargo box. When I got back, I dis-assembled the cargo box and returned it for a full refund. It was a pain to re-pack it but the Amazon process for returning items was excellent!

If I had known this I would never have ordered this package. My daughter is older than my middle boy and my youngest is no longer a baby.

The downside is, of course, that you wind up with two different keys for the car - one for the doors and one for the ignition. The other downside is that the key for the ignition is actually for a different year of Saturn! This ignition lock cylinder uses a key intended for a 1996 Saturn, but the cylider also fits 1997-1999 (and maybe other year) Saturns, which use a differently-shaped key.Nevertheless, the cylinder installed easily, and works like new. I'm happy, and my daughter does not mind carrying the extra key."
98601,0,"Couldn't tell from the minimal amount of product content on the page or the pic, but this seat cover has a plush, fuzzy exterior. I wasn't so enamored with that, so I've returned it. Otherwise, it seemed to fit the bucket seat in my VW Golf alright."

141339,2,"When ordering, I didn't realize how small this is. I cannot see my whole face in it, no matter what. If I had a back seat, then, maybe I could from there. I don't, though. Although I've used the light a few times instead of turning on the overhead light, it doesn't really illuminate my face enough to use the mirror. Just enough to find my phone in the dark so that the screen gives me a brighter light.It's pretty thick, as well. It would not clip onto the hinge side of the visor in my CRX. Instead, it clips on the outside edge so that, when the visor is straight down, the mirror is on the end near the floor, not the ceiling. I find myself, still, turning the rear view toward me instead of using this tiny visor mirror. Not very good."

176776,0,"Lights arrived and looked good. Electrical plug is very cheap and several times had lights not working and had to take them off and reinsert plugs. After several attemps, I just cut off the plugs and hardwired them in. I used the silicone around the gasket just like the instructions called for and found after a few days that two of the lights were showing condensation inside the lens! This can only mean one thing and that is that the hermetic sealing was not completed correctly during manufacturing. I also noticed that they did not sit perfectly flush with the roof like my stock lights did but was ok with that. Upon contacting Recon about the condensation I was told that it was because I didn't use silicone like the instructions stated but in fact I did. Then I was told it was because the lights weren't flush with the roof. Well I didn't design them so how am I supposed to be responsible for the fit? My question to them was why are only two of the five lights condensating if it was due to a faulty install as they claimed? This is utter nonsense. If a lens is correctly hermetically sealed as they claim their lights are, then they would never be able to get condensation inside, silicone or no silicone. Moisture only gets in if the lens is not entirely sealed in the manufacturing process. They obviously are made with little or no quality control. Kind of expected this when I saw they were made in China though. Get what you pay for I guess. I was thinking about the smoked HID headlights they have for my truck but for $450 a pop, after seeing the low quality of these, my money will go elsewhere. I feel that they should send me another set and maybe out of ten, I can get five that are correctly sealed."

The first leg of our first trip down our suitcases almost ended up scattered over the Garden State Parkway!! People were frantically pointing to our roof and low and behold the pack had opened (lesson to us to use twist ties or a small padlock next time to secure the zipper). On our trip home we had to stop constantly because the ties kept loosening up. When my husband took the pack off the car we found there was a hole in the pack the size of a fist. Wouldn't you think that we wouldn't use it again??? Well we are a glutton for punishment and my husband has great faith in duct tape. On this recent trip one of the straps ripped clear off and we had to tie it down with what was on hand. Its unusable now after roughly 25 hours of use."
181344,2,This universal seat cover is not universal. My 2008 Chevy Silverado has the high back seats pictured in this product's add. The seat cover is stretched to the max. The fit is so bad I am sure the seams are going to tear out way before the cover should wear out.

It says it wouldn't fit my car that it was for a dodge or chrysler minivan but I did some research and my 1992 new yorker has the same 3.3 liter v6 as the minivans of the same year so I took a chance and it worked so if you have a dodge dynasty or new yorker between 89 and 93 with a 3.3 then it will fit no matter what the application guide says. I also plan on calling gates to let them know to add it to the list of vehicles it works on. Hope this helps"
165088,2,"This jack served me well for one year, and while it remained together in one piece it looked like a nice product.Yesterday however I had to use it to lift my Nissan Altima out of a pile of snow, and the articulated frame gear broke at the base, so the entire frame turned to one side. The car came down without anything holding it. Fortunately we were all keeping enough distance from the car, so this was only a minor incident.I later took the jack to my garage bench and, for sake of curiosity, tried to put the frame back where it should be, using a rubber hammer. I was just trying to understand what went wrong with the gear. One of the jack support legs broke after the first strike, flying as a shard. So once more I was exposed to a hazardous situation! Imagine the legs breaking and flying away while the jack is holding the weight of a car!!!In conclusion, this jack was built with cheap and unreliable steel. Don't buy it unless you want to put your life at risk. Next jack will come from a more reputable brand."

Well, after getting my 2006 VFR800 VTEC, I figured it couldn't hurt. It did not! It seems the bike runs a little smoother, and sound and performance are much better, especially after the second set of valves kick in at about 6400 RPM. And as said by ""Brock"", it does make more sense to not have to buy a new filter every time, plus I actually got it for less money than what Honda was charging for the OE filter."

Thank goodness for Amazon, they stated they do not warrant product it is warranted thru manufacturer, but since it was just past 30 days, they gave me a credit which was used to order another blade, and it is ok. Bottom line if you are purchasing these blades for the 5 year warranty I would not count on it. The blades themselves do a remarkable job clearing the windshield, just don't count on any warranty from Silblade."

I love the quietness these break pads provide, definitely better than the stock brakes the manufacturer had on the car.You can't go wrong with a product like this. If you must replace your brake pads, buy this set.Hope this helps- please respond with any questions or comments."

81593,1,I purchased the 0-100 PSI and the 0-60 PSI plus a protective cover for each. It really is no problem putting on the covers. Two crescent wrenches and some pipe stick. The whole process took about 15 minutes for both. I immediately checked the reading of both gauges on a tire with 40 PSI and they were right on. They feel good in your hand and you get a firm connection on the tire stem each time. Multiply readings on the same tire give you a consistent number. I like these gauges and would buy them again but would recommend always purchasing a cover.

39194,2,"Scanner works fine, downloaded error code, cleared code, and triggered recording on code just fine. Then I tried to get the recording off on to my PC.The PC software is half-finished and barely working.A). USB drivers don't install unless you install them manually.B). PC software has only 2 features, update firmware and print data. Since the last firmware release was in 6/8/2007, it is safe to assume Actron is not updating their firmware, so that means the PC software has only ONE piece of functionality: Print data. Print data just prints what displays on the Actron screen. Easier to write it out by hand then to try and install the software manually just to download the data.Further, the PC software has all sorts of buttons and functions that just don't work, like they started writing the software then just stopped. There is a wizard to register a scan tool, called ""Add a scan tool"" the wizard just stops on screen 3, and the title of the screen says: ""Title of enter manually screen"" like some non-English speaker just never finished the software, it's that much of a joke.I'm considering trying to return this to Amazon, just because the PC software is not finished, and totally useless."

7438,2,"Bought this unit from Amazon under the Duracell name a few years ago and it failed the first time I tried it with an E03 just like everybody else. It's a shame because the unit itself is well made and the product would be useful if it actually worked. Look at the reviews. If you get this unit you are most probably just chucking $500 or so down the wellhole, or the sump if that's what you use it for.A well made, pretty, and utterly useless piece of junk. If yours isn't yet just wait awhile. And product support is a joke. There are about 6 ""service centers"" in the whole southern USA and nobody seems to know jack about this product. Xantrex does not seem to care. They would probably rather just sell them off quietly. I quit buying double A Duracells because they participated in spreading this worthless environmental hazard all over North America.If you wonder why I am writing this so long after the thing failed for me it's because I've finally got tired of seeing it wasting space in the back of the garage and will summon up the time and energy to take this very heavy and very useless hunk of lead to a recycling facility tomorrow. A further waste of time and effort to go along with a waste of money! It's every bit as big a pain to get rid of it as it was to try and get it to work in the first place. Buyer beware..."

71751,1,This is a great deal on a well known air filter. Anyone who is a gear head knows who K&N is. Can't beat the price either. To get a superior air filter that will help your bike breath better for only $15 more than a stock OEM filter is a no brainer. Came fast and fit perfectly. My only complaint is that no where on the box does it say its already oiled and ready to go. Had to find that out on the internet. Otherwise I had no regrets.

168981,1,I purchased this item for the rear suspension of a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan. This product restored the ride to better than factory smoothness. The Monroe Sensatrac is the best choice if you are looking for the smoothest & softest ride. I am also very impressed that Monroe provides a lifetime replacement warranty on this product.
102908,0,"A lot of thought went into this design. I was a bit apprehensive reading some negative comments but just had a chance to test it in a snow storm today. I have a tall SUV. Clearing 4 inches or more is just impossible with a regular broom.This thing is built sturdy with a riveted head. If you manage to break it, which I can't imagine how you would do, the company says they will replace it no questions asked. There are rubber bristles on one side which won't harm your car's finish. I can just about clear the entire roof standing from one side. From the other side, it works to pull off the remaining few inches.I was also concerned about the telescoping handle. Other types of twist-lock handles do not hold up against the weight of the snow and are useless for pushing. This one has a pair of claws which pinch into holes along the handle for a strong grip at several lengths.In a pinch you could use it for a snow shovel, but it would be better to have a snow shovel. And ice? Nah, won't do ice. I use a spray-on de-ice'r to melt thick sheets of frozen rain. Here's a tip - ice scrapers made from brass rip thru ice like butter but won't scratch glass. They're very difficult to find since nobody believes it. Just, don't use them on curved rear-view mirrors which may be made from plastic.Edit:After just two storms one of the clips snapped off. These clips hold the telescoping handle at a certain length. I contacted the company who was very apologetic and shipped a replacement right out to me, no questions asked. Apparently the clips on the side is the weakest part of otherwise sturdy construction. They are in the process of re-designing the snow mover to make the clips stronger. The replacement arrived shortly thereafter. To my surprise, the clip did not even survive shipping and the new snow mover arrived broken.I really have a need to get the snow off my car, so again I wrote the company and attached a high definition photograph of the defect on both products. This time the company's response turned a bit colder. I was told that my photograph would have to be examined by experts and more photographs of the broken part may be required. They complained about the cost of shipping a replacement to me again and offered they might just offer me a refund - which still would not have resolved my problem of moving snow.To the company's credit, they again sent me a replacement which stood up to shipping. They may be re-designing the product for next season. I was told that ""ANOTHER"" snow mover was being shipped and the packing slip had a note to double-check that no defects in the product were observed before it went out. I was getting the impression that my integrity was being called in question, even after I sent them high definition photographs.My opinion of them went from sympathy of a start-up company trying to overcome initial design problems to a company who is making a defective product, knows about the defect, and is just hoping that customers will accept this. It's a real shame to see that this product is made in America. The rest of it is made very sturdy. If yours breaks, you can probably drill a hole in the plastic and push a pin (or something) through it to keep it at length."
162618,0,"I love K&N; filters and have used them for 15 years for all my cars. I decided to replace the stock filter in our Subaru Forester and ordered the 33-2304 based on the sizing chart. Amazon was great and shipped it out immediately and rec'd in 3 days. When I tried to install it, it would not fit. Comparing the stock to the K&N;, the outer rubber ring/gasket dims are the same but the actual element portion of the K&N; is wider and the Subaru air intake box is too narrow so while it fits on 1 side, it's impossible to close the filter housing.Amazon was great with the return. I emailed K&N; to advise them of the issue and never rec'd a response."
184127,0,"Purchased these just before Christmas. The mats were advertised as custom fitted for my wifes Ford Explorer.The mats are nice quality, not top quality and the custom fit is a little off on the driver side, where they slightly bunch up on the sides. However, for the money, they are nice mats and the ill fit is off just a little. I would recommend them if you are looking for a nice medium priced mat. Just note, they are not factory quality."
92274,1,plain and simple: I needed to upgrade my OEM NKG plugs in my Mazdaspeed3 and these have been to 'go-to' plugs when it comes to our platform. The gapping is almost perfect (they came gapped at .028 and I needed them down to .026). Amazon seems to also price these the best and always have them in stock. Get these if you need to go a step colder and plan on tuning your ride :)
119972,1,No problem with delivery or installation. The footplate enlarger definitely makes it easier to raise and lower and I'm quite satisfied with the accessory.
180286,0,"I was surprised by the excellent reviews of this item. The carpet is very thin, far thinner than any other floor mat I've ever seen. The rubber is heavy enough to keep it down though, and if you are in need of a runner for your vehicle, there are very few choices around. I was happy with the price and availability on Amazon, but don't expect this to look right in your luxury vehicle."
54020,1,"This is good little product that does what it is intended to do. The price is a bit steep for the actual components, and it is a profit maker for the Manufacturer. But, it does the Job!!!!"
174337,2,"I bought this for a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee which this SS should fit and it doesn't work.The bolt supplied for the Jeep application is not long enough when needed to use the lock washer.The tapered sleeve is useless as it cannot fit within the opening of the bracket on the tie rod sleeve.Also, it should include a bellow to protect it. You cannot even use the original one to modify it.Overall, it was a waste of time and money and I am out of my return window so i'm SOL."
90518,1,Fits really nice on my 2013 C250 and it shows my wheels are locked as the other bolts are black in color.
107689,1,"If you have a high performance engine then this is the filter to use. One really nice feature is the hex form on the top of the filter, you can use a regular socket to remove the filter in tight places. Really comes in handy on one of my hot rods that has big tube headers as that makes it difficult to get an oil filter wrench on the filter. Better flow and better filtering than standard filters with better pressure capability."
167202,1,"Went with the Universal Sensor for the ""after CAT"" installation on 2001 Toyota Sienna. After the installation the check engine light cleared and I was able to get my state inspection completed. In addtion, the vehicle is running better than it has in quite a while and is getting noticably better fuel mileage. The installation kit was good as it included some crimp connectors and heat shrink to splice into the existing connection. In my particular case, I would have had to remove the seat and carpet etc. to get to the plug. Splicing allowed me to leave the existing plug etc. in tact and just make the connections at the sensor. Note: I did try to solder the wires instead but it did not work well as I could not get the solder to flow. I decided to go with the provided crimp connectors, and heat shrink. The sensor looks to be pretty much an exact match. The wires are color coded the same etc. and you just connect like colors with the existing wiring. There are two black wires, but it is just a heater element so the polarity does not matter on those. Overall very satified, save myself a bundle doing the work myself."
72620,1,"first of all. the light isnt so bright but, the rotator goes pretty well and gets people out of youre way in an emergency"
175096,0,These are really cute in the car. The seat covers fit snugly and securely. But the steering wheel cover stinks to the high heavens! It is so awful I can't use it in the car.
72759,2,"I read some scary reviews about the cheaper, made in China, spring compressors. I paid $17 and change for this tool. It was the most expersive one that I saw. The first thing that I saw when I unpacked it was ""made in China"" I could have bought this tool at my local Harbor Freight store for $8. Although it worked, the two compression arms (jaws) were drifting away from each other sideways more and more as I tightened the compressing nut. Made me a bit nervous. The instructions say to use a 1/2 inch wrench to open and close the jaws. Not so. The nut actually required a 13mm metric wrench. If I had it to do over, I would have gone to Harbor Freight and saved $9."
104223,1,"The price for this filter ($31.00) was less than the OEM paper filter you have to replace every 6000 to 7000 miles. And the beauty of K & N filters is when dirty you just wash it with K & N cleaner & water & just let air dry,then reoil with K & N filter spray oil. Also the filter will probably out live your bike."
65573,1,"I'm very satisfied with this product. This is a gift for Christmas and I have one myself and I love it. Works great, I highly recommend it especially for a person that loves to keep their car looking great in between washes."
158455,1,"when i first got this cover i didn't think it would fit, but after heating it up in a bucket of hot water it slipped on my steering wheel like a glove. and you can't beat the price. $10 for a steering cover that is perfect."
129508,2,It does look like a work of patches but instead of being a size too small i ordered two sizes too large. Jillian leather doesn't answer emails and they only have xxl and up on their site for this style jacket. if your going to buy this i wear an xl usually but a medium probably would have fit me.
155893,2,Wasn't usable for us as the decal sticks (or more appropriately DOESN'T stick) to the wrong side of the window to display our enthusiasm for our beloved Giants. Bummer.
145752,0,"In these days of $100 35 Watt HID kits, and that's without going to Chinese garbage, it's hard to justify stuffing a pair of these in every six months or so. With the amount of night driving I do I don't get anywhere near a year out of these. The light is slightly whiter and slightly brighter, but not enough to make any claims of HID like performance. I want all the light I can get without upsetting other drivers, so I have persisted with these, but the short life makes the payoff very questionable.I'm trying Osram Ultras next, 65 Watt but more importantly 500 hour life."
50109,0,I chose this rating because this is a top of the line product! I loved the way these bonnets worked! I would highly recomend this product to anyone!
165531,1,"I've installed these heavier rubber flaps on my camper. Hoping to have them protect the discharge system and stuff behind from debris. So far, so good."
51968,1,"Great product, made a huge difference when towing a heavy trailer thru the mountains. And feels better on the highway. I have much larger than stock tires."
126321,1,"I purchased this item recently, and had my mechanic fit it to my vehicle along with the power stop break kit. It is factory spec, and fits the vehicle perfectly, with no difficulties. I really don't know too much about this stuff, technically speaking, but I just wanted to pass along that it fits a 2010 Mazda 3i sport perfectly."
187569,1,"I recently purchased two compresors, one for car tires and this one for bike tires. Features that I like on this unit are the long hose and the built-in quage. The noise it makes is bearable, the only negative is that the piece that clamps on the valve stem is difficult to un-couple without releasing much of the air that you have pumped. I am still trying several release techniques to mitigate this problem."
80237,1,This part is sturdy and should outlive the car if slathered with a little grease once in a while. It is missing the cable sheath that normally rides in the draw channel and doesn't come with a stop-nut which is crucial to the installation. Easiest solution is to use your old stop nut along with the conventional nut supplied by cable mfgr and cinch the two nuts together to create the pull point. The correct way is to find a new metric stop-nut at your hardware store.
48596,2,"I have had this unit for a few years and used it for filling up basketballs and some tires. Airing up my truck tires to 80 psi from about 25 psi is an all-day job. This unit is not designed for that level of air pushing. And today I fried it by running for about 15 minutes to pressurize some plumbing for a test. It didn't make it to 100 psi before smoke started billowing out and the unit quit. These machines should have thermal switches which cut off the machine before it kills itself. If all you're ever going to do is fill bike tires and balls, this is fine. For anything more, you need something bigger."
83309,1,This is a nice open face helmet. It feels sturdy and looks sharp. I'm going to pinstripe mine.
182046,0,The hitch appeared to be made well. When I tried to install the hitch the bolt holes wouldn't line up. It looked like the hitch had warped when it was welded. I returned the hitch for a refund. Amazon was great as usual and refunded my money with no hassles.
165271,1,"All in all, a great kit that is very easy to install. Provides a very nice mood lighting, but dont expect it to light up your entire car. Here are a couple improvements they could make:1. Wires are too short. I put these lights in a 370z which has a very small interior. I mounted the controller in my console and the LED wires that i mounted under my dash barely reached. The wires have literally no slack. Also the power wires wouldnt reach my fuse box, had to extend them by about 3 feet. If i put the controller anywhere else, at least one LED bar wouldnt reach my desired location.2. LED wires are hard wired to conroller. They cannot be unplugged for installation. This means whatever holes that have to be drilled need to be large enough to either fit the LED bars or the contoller through.3. Controller was poorly planned. All of the led wires come out the bottom of the controller and power wires come out the top. All should come out the back so that the controller can be mounted and still look good. If you mount the controller on a dash or something, you will have wires coming out from the top and bottom of the controller, just looks sloppy. If you are buying this product, find a hidden place to mount the conroller4. Sound mode doesnt follow the music that well.All in all, great product for the money. Easy to install."
41705,2,Not sure if this is the correct tool. Tried to remove my Ford Escape radio with these and I still haven't been able to get it out of the dash.
123961,0,"maybe a little increase in horse power, most of it is probably mental anyway now with all the electronic sensors on a vehicle."
67649,1,GREAT PRODUCT! Already have the struts and the ride is great! Will use again. Perfect fit. Are the best for classic cars.
151223,0,"These are all right and are true to the description. The main problems are that they don't stay up very well (can get kicked off by kid), and that they don't cover the sides of the seat, so if your child sits in the middle, the sides of both front seats are still vulnerable to dirty feet. They were easy to ""install,"" though."
93649,0,"Device works well, but it trips off on heat when I try to charge with my 5amp battery charger."
440,1,This is a great kit. Comes with almost everything you need. Meguiar's products are high quality and give you great results when you use them. The only thing missing is the glass cleaner.
181090,1,"Ford listed a different size belt for the 2000 Explorer XLT, but after doing some research this belt is the correct size"
95801,1,"I put this little magic air filter in my Vulcan 800 Classic and I was stupified. I used to shift into second at 20-25, now its 35. This mystical device gave it a very noticeable acceleration boost and even made my pipes louder, can't wait to see a mpg gain. Are these made by elves?"
182478,1,"item arrived fast and in excellent condition. Installed item using procedure indicated in factory shop manual. No special tools necessary but you would need a dependable puller to do the job.the size of the pulley however was larger that the one originally installed in my 1996 grand caravan with a v6 3.8L engine.I needed to replace the serpentine belt with a longer oneOther than that, installation was a little hard but with patience, everythingwent well"
187536,2,"I received this for Christmas 2009 and didn't use it till March of 2010.After approx. 1 month, the machine screws worked loose from the head and the compressor wouldn't perform. I fixed it myself.3 months later, the unit ceased working - this time it was because the motor had picked up foreign material and it was shorting out the brushes - what others have reported as smoke and a smell of electrical fire. If jostled, the unit might work, but at a lower speed and output.I've given up on it.It's poorly engineered for my needs, which were pretty light duty - mostly topping off lawn tractor tires.A hand pump is a better investment than this."
79546,2,Not at all what I thought it would be. Was flimsy and doesn't seem that it will last long. I won't try this again.
9168,1,"It is well made and holds a charge, I keep it in my trunk for emergencies. Instructions are pretty good too."
89063,1,"I ordered this part for my husbands birthday, I was told it would be delivered a couple days after his birthday which was fine , but it came two days before his birthday. He was very pleased with the grille insert and his SUV looks great now. Thank you for the fast deivery."
74175,0,"Like the quality of the product, but needs to be wider and deeper to give best coverage sun glare protection."
183904,2,"I wasn't looking for a full on DOT serious helmet (I have 3 of those) but I wanted a spare for the girlfriend to do the bar hop around town and I thought the price was right. What a pile of junk. Super bubble head, uncomfortable interior material, and not even shaped for a normal head! I've had a ton of helmets over the years and they all seem to fit my head pretty well - guess I can assume I have a pretty standard skull - and this one appears to be made for odd shaped craniums or neanderthal man. Just not right. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk. I returned it immediately."
59276,2,"I just re-read the description, and the above seat cover description is a gross misrepresentation. It incorrectly, if not fraudulently indicates that the covers were customized to fit my specific model. The covers are a sloppy fit, especially on the passenger side, and the controls that are not completely covered are available only through wide sloppy generic openings obviously made to account for any number of general configurations."
76677,0,not the best design but OK Suction cups do not hold the transponder does not sit as flat as it should against the widow
156729,1,"I got a set of these blades for my car and couldn't be happier. They clean the window better than any other blade I have tried. Yes there are cheaper blades on the market, however these out perform all of them."
73786,1,K&N filter are without a doubt the finest filters for the money. Super easy to install and this filter has both increased my gas milage on my bike but most importantly it increased my horsepower. I didn't know that my bike was so responsive until l installed this filter. Worth the money!!!!!
89518,2,"My order was cancelled a week after I placed (and PAID) for it, because of ""out of stock"" conditions. Notified Christmas Eve. So, no gift for this friend thanks to Amazon. Surely Amazon can't take a week to figure out they can't fill the order."
174327,2,I bought two controls which one worked perfectly and the other failure is not as good the price is not cheap but low quality
113591,0,"The product that arrived is quite different than what is pictured, and thus will be going back.I quite like the pictured item, but what actually arrived was a larger, black and white model that has large, white RAM lettering underneath a white Ram logo, all on a rectangular black background. The product seems solid enough but, in my opinion, is not nearly as attractive as the shiny one pictured. Since I bought it mostly to dress up the hitch receiver when I don't have the hitch installed, it kind of defeats the purpose."
48521,2,"I had the Airstation for about two couple years, but I only used it 5-10 times. It has now stopped working on AC power, and it puts out less air than it used to on DC power. This product will only frustrate you when you need it."
173211,0,"Not as good as product I thought it would be from reading on car care forums. Had to really rub to take off water spots after washing car. Leaves an ok shine but it is intended to be used with the Klasse glaze as the final step which I did not purchase, it is nice not to worry about getting it on plastic or rubber trim and deepens there colors."
77546,0,"I use 38W30L pants and, according to the size chart, got the XL short. Length is ok, thanks to the repositionable kee protectors, albeit a wee bit long. The pants are quite baggy. I can use them with the warmers in over jeans and still feel quite baggy. The waist is OK tho. Once on, they are quite comfortable but the miriad zippers and velcro closures, while convenient, can be overwhelming. Going to the bathroom is a patient maneuver. Pockets are convenient and well sized. Compl&ntilde;etely waterproof; you can stand in a carwash and come out dry inside."
174110,1,Fast service and the product worked fine in my case. I would recommend it and buy again.
131382,0,I installed this on my 2003 Ford Focus because the old one was getting stuck and I read that it was a common problem and needed to be replaced. I tried everything I could to loosen the old one up but it did not fix the problem.The Motocraft SW6285 has fixed the problem so far. I selected this product over others because I could key it to my existing key and Motocraft has provided me quality products in the past for Ford replacement parts. The instructions are okay but could be better. I was not able to get the retaining clip installed and the instructions did not give me any information on how to install it so that is why I rate it as three stars. I left the retaining clip off and it works fine but I am worried that it may cause a problem in the future although later models did not require this clip so it may be fine.
64210,0,"I gave this product 3 stars, even though when I have used it (twice so far), I've had excellent results. I took 2 stars off in that P & G should have supported the product with replacement items for longer than they have. I do agree with an earlier review, that the best thing about the kit is the filter and the ability to rinse virtually spot-free. I was smart enough when buying it to pick up a couple of spare filters/soap refills, but when looking around recently, I saw there were no more to be had. I did find them on E-bay and here on Amazon for around $9 each. However today I stopped at an Odd-Lots and saw the whole kit selling for $4. I bought all six that they had on the shelf! If you are looking for replacements, check out your local Odd-Lots."
112427,1,"I have these gloves in black (the ""stealth"" version where the leather is not perforated) and they are by far my favorites.Sizing / Fit:I have small hands, and usually wear a small or medium in ladies' gloves. I bought a women's small in these and they fit great. I also have med. length fingernails (maybe about 1/3 inch past my fingertips) and they pose no problem in the gloves.Look / Feel:These are great all-leather gloves that feel great the first time you wear them. They don't look all bulgy and huge like other motorcycle gloves that I've tried -- which is really important to me! I wear them while riding my Vespa and they just blend right in. The protection in the knuckles looks a little crazy in the pictures, but it looks totally fine on your hands. It doesn't stick out much and you don't look funny wearing the gloves when you're not on your bike.Warmth:As I stated above, I have the non-perforated version, so that's the only one I can comment on. These gloves are great for daytime riding in mild weather. Sometimes when I ride my Vespa late after work and it's cooled off outside my hands are really cold by the time I get home. I tried wearing these in the winter for riding (ok, Northern Cali winter.. so we're talking 40-50 degrees mostly) and they were not warm enough. My hands were freezing and after driving a couple of miles going 50-55. By the time I would get home my fingers would be practically numb. I tried wearing another pair of thin gloves under them to keep warm but the fit is so close that practically nothing would fit. I also tried jamming some of those hot packs into the palms, which helped a tiny bit, but it still wasn't really bareable because they didn't help my fingers. I eventually just gave up and stopped riding when it was so cold outside (not just because of the gloves, but overall I was just too cold and not willing to wear all sorts of layers when I could just take the car instead :) I don't think the warmth factor is a negative on the gloves at all - as I didn't really expect them to be all-weather gloves.Overall, these are the best gloves I've found for wearing while riding my scooter. The fit, feel, and look are exactly what I wanted. I just need to find an alternative for wearing in colder weather!"
86701,1,"Received on time works great. Fast delivery and is of very high quality, I would purchase from this vendor again."
85764,1,With the windshield mount I don't experience the &#34;hood glare&#34; issues that some get with driving lights. These lights are attractive and VERY bright. I aim them just above/beyond my high beams and they work perfectly. The installation was simple and straightforward. A single instruction sheet was all that was needed.
133081,1,Recommended spark plug for my Honda mower. Used these plugs for years and have never encountered a problem. Best price here too.
65603,1,"Once my car is washed and waxed, all I have to do is brush this over the car every day for a minute, and it maintains the car looking like it was just washed. I would only use it on day old dust and pollen to keep from scratching the clear coat. It works amazingly well on my black car, and keeps it looking freshly detailed. Make sure you do it gently, and you'll get amazing results every time."
52285,0,"Pros: good size for most midsize sedans; clean minimalist appearanceCons: fabric is not very transparent: for a clear, reliable view of vehicles behind you, you will have to use your side-view mirrors; plastic anchors for vertical mounting behind rear headrests are clumsy and didn't fit either of my vehicles well."

149205,1,"My 2001 Jeep Cherokee Liftgate lift supports have been slowly going out on me. I had put off replacing them until while under the Liftgate it fell on my head, knocked me to the ground and split my head open where I was rushed to the ER and had to have staples placed in my scalp. Hard way to learn, don't let them go out on you, replace if you see they are going bad.I did my research and wanted the best I could find. I wanted to buy the very same ones that were on my Jeep when I bought it new. I found them but the price was awful. Than I came to Amazon and found these which are the very same ones that sale for $40.00 each all over the Internet, for only $5.00 each.... I bought 2 Liftgate Supports, one for each side for only $10.00 and with Free shipping. They took all of 20 minutes to put on and I did it myself..I am a 65 year old YOUNG lady... I did have a friend hold up the liftgate while I put the new ones on. They work great and I love them. You can not go wrong at this price and great maker...Please, if you are having problems with your Liftgate staying up, don't wait.. Replace them now, before you find yourself in the ER the way I did. I think God it wasn't worst. You sure can't beat the price... and they work Great..."

75741,0,"Received this just in time for our -14 weather. Kept the hands much warmer than the plain old steering wheel. Wouldn't classify it as plush, but it's functional. Was tight to put on the steering wheel (jeep), but once on, it stays, and does not slide on the wheel, so control is maintained nicely. Delivery was right on schedule, no problems"

170185,1,"We would recommend this to anyone needing to eliminate bags inside their vehicle on trips. It was easy to attach to our roof rack and the dust cover was great for keeping the duffel bag protected on the roof from bugs/rain,etc. We drove 1400+ miles and everything was still in great shape when we got to our destination. If you travel alot, I would recommend getting 2. There was room to place another one on our roof rack sitting side-by-side. Also having the duffel bag on wheels is great too. Great Product!!"

150123,0,"A news article touted this size inverter as capable of powering a refrigerator and operating a sump pump. That would be a very small fridge and pump. My modest refrigerator ran awhile, but the compressor blew out even though the rating plate showed current demand within the range of the inverter. The start-up demand is the problem. The device is too small to run a 1/3 HP sump pump. It cannot power a 3/4 HP air compressor.It is good for running small tools, electronic devices, and lights. During nearly two weeks following hurricane Sandy, I used it to heat a house, powering a gas-fired heating boiler with three heating zone pumps. It was clipped to the battery of an idling car which consumed a gallon of gasoline over several hours--far cheaper and quieter than running a portable generator."
96316,0,"I've got this brush before the last storm in New England. It is a little bit heavy and the brush is too hard. It may even cause some scratches if used incautiously. So it would be better to clean up the glassy areas of car with it specially for SUVs. Although it is blue on ad, they sent me a red brush. There wasn't any color preferences when I ordered it."

17418,2,"it's a nice looking helmet, and aside from the chinstrap, it fits well too. i read a review before I bought the helmet, and I agree w/ that review. the chin strap is in the wrong place, so it's more of a choker, than anything else. additionally, at highway speeds, chinstrap will loosen up, and the helmet will try to slide off; trying to readjust the chinstrap is near impossible. then the quick release on the chinstrap is unreliable; it holds securely when riding, you don't have to worry about that, but when you try to remove the helmet, maybe the quick release will release, maybe it won't.in the end, the only problem with the helmet is the chinstrap, but there are 3 problems that i've had with the chinstrap, and unless the manufacturer can correct those deficiencies, your money is better spent on a different product.mike"
158301,1,Fast delivery and good packaging. Perfect replacement for the belt on our daughter's chair. Good materials and good construction. Easy to install and adjust. Has not corroded from liquid spills and repeated cleanings.
30820,1,"Have some RV air horns on my truck and this was the last part to complete my system, works great, doesnt leak and was a good price."
129505,1,"NOTE - This tailgate is NOT chrome! It is painted a somewhat metallic-silver color. My hubby was surprised at this, but I'd already known, from reading other reviews. We have a White truck w/gold along the bottom of doors & sidepanels, chrome & black bumpers & chrome & black tubular running boards - I'm usually pretty picky but I think this color tailgate still looks great! Especially when you compare it with the chrome version & the huge hike in price for chrome...no thanks!Great price, I'd checked other stores online & local & Amazon had the best price, by far! Add in Prime shipping & it was a no-brainer! Tailgate came super fast (I LOVE PRIME!!) and box was in good shape. Took me longer to get screws out of my pickup bed that it did to attach this one! The screws that came with it didn't work for me, but luckily my old ones were fine so I just re-used them. Looks sharp, Paint has good clear-coating so it has resisted scratches so far & I'm def not ""easy"" on it! Closes tight, locks & unlocks fine (I checked it when we installed it), although that's a feature I doubt I'll use much.I can highly recommend this tailgate - fast shipping, great packaging, awesome hitch!"
60823,1,"Looked all over and finially found this filter here. Lowest price anywhere. Not exactly like the original filter, but it fit fine. Haven't noticed any different in mileage yet, but only put on about about 200 miles. Like the idea, never have to buy another motorcycle filter for my bike, ever. Recieved it very fast from Amazon Thanks, Jim"
92866,0,"It fits fine in my aunt's 1997 Acura Integra. The paper filter and construction was pretty cheap. For a few bucks more, I should have gone with OEM. This filter has less surface area. On the bright side, this filter fits like it should"
182262,1,"This is an absolute must, for towing with a Jeep Cherokee. UPS showed up with the kit and in 5 minutes I had the spare tire out, body panels off, and the harness plugged in. Turn, brake, and lights worked instantly with no need to trouble shoot an improper ground. Perfect length for any towing application. The T connector is a perfect fit and far easier and safer than splicing into your harness."
58213,0,The book was just what I needed to find out what the some buttons where for on my Jeep Cherokee.
64359,2,Received the set with a broken plastic piece. I was not able to use it since the part broken was the most important piece which was to be attached to the dented car wall and pulled. I came complete though. Cheap but completely a waste.
125370,2,I have a Dodge Ram 1500. The cover didn't fit at all. It is WAY too small. The headrest covers didn't fit either. It tore as I tried to put it on. Definitely won't work for a full width bench seat. I really sorry I wasted the money. MIGHT work for a small bench seat with separate head rests.
162562,0,"Not particularly good quality... obviously off-shore made.I bought 2, 1 unit quit soon, rubber cover tore while opening unit to replace bulb.you get what you pay for... or less as in this case."
172170,1,This LED tube looks great and the quality is also great. I have this product installed in my car for about two years now and it still works great!
179113,0,easy to install but it started coming off after about a month i did everything correct i even used the application kit ill just take my car to a pro for my windows
83393,2,"They accept the payment, but never sent the Item.Now I have to cancel after three weeks of waiting.unbelievable but true, do not send e-mail to keep you informed."
21862,1,"One day, my key stopped fitting in my driver's side lock (I'm pretty sure someone tampered with it, trying to break into my car when I was in the store). I looked into my options, and this seemed like an inexpensive option (and more fun than replacing the lock!). I have a 96 Nissan Sentra, and my Dad (who is an engineer and VERY good at fixing/installing stuff) had it installed in less than an hour. I definitely recommend asking someone who has some experience with this type of task to do it, but its DEFINITELY not worth paying a mechanic for. Since my car doesn't have an electronic trunk button, I couldn't hook up that function, but I still got everything I needed out of this product! Very satisfied!"
182391,0,"I put these on my ATV at an angle to give me a wider light beam, they are not bad. Not as bright as I had hoped."
92521,0,"maybe a little increase in horse power, most of it is probably mental anyway now with all the electronic sensors on a vehicle."
91694,0,"I thought all Purolator products were made in USA, but apparently most transmission filters are made in China. The one I took out was an ATP I think, and it had &#34;Made in USA&#34; stamped on it, was a little disappointed that this one came from China.I would assume this is no better, or worse, than most other transmission filters."
84301,2,"not as shinny as the picture. It's all plastic...looks and feels cheap, but the price justifies cheapness.not a perfect fit for my CRV's break pedal, but i got it on. gas pedal fit perfect.if looks are important to you, then u need to spend little more."
1758,0,Unit has the juice to power the wife's laptop and the kids' DVD player though I got nothing out of the USB plug even when everything else was unplugged.
56075,1,"I use these gloves for work, where I handle boxes all day! They lasted me at least 6 months before I had to buy another pair, which is fine considering the price. These gloves are great, and for the price, it doesn't hurt to try them out for yourself. I highly recommend Mechanix"
18832,1,these came in the mail very quickly and exactly as stated. brand new in box with everything that I need. I cant wait to be able to put my motor together. i am very pleased working with amazon for all of my parts!
116441,2,"the fit over the rear axle isnt very good, rubs on diff.Not much louder than stock muffler.Chrome exhaust tip turned goldish in color in two days."
80171,1,"These snowchains arrived in Holland in just 3 days! They come in a easy to stow container and weigh less then i thougt. You just roll them out, make sure the hooks are on the right side and fix them round the tire. Then put on the tensionbelt and youre ready to go on. Good value for money."
46664,1,ngk is one of the most reliable plugs on the market. takes a lot to foul one. longer lasting than a champion
63622,1,"It seems well enough made and it worked fine for my small trailer connected to me Touareg. Plastic housing doesn't seem really sturdy, but it shouldn't be under any significant stress so that is fine."
36807,1,"Ordered this bag almost a year ago. It's been so useful. I love not having to carry a backpack. However, because I hate carrying a backpack, I shove this thing FULL. This bag will happily carry a pair of shoes (women's size six: not too impressive a feat (hardy har har.)) along with a change of clothes, if you roll them. However, when you add in a nalgene, some makeup, a notebook and chargers (which it will hold along with the clothes and shoes!!!) the bag starts to get a little stretched. After a lot of abuse like this, the seams are starting to stress next to the zipper. However, the bag is still going strong.On the other hand, be careful when putting it on your bike. I've yet to have it scratch my bike, but it has put a tiny dent in my car when the STRONG magnets got too close. I've also had the magnets accidentally snag metal chairs, mirror frames, and other metal objects. Over time, the rubber pouch housing the magnets has started to tear around the edges. I solved this by putting a thin layer of stiff plastic (like a clear plastic bendy shoe form from Journeys) in between the magnet and the layer that touches my bike. It hasn't made the connection any weaker, so maybe I should have just done it as a preventative measure."
43775,1,"The 3030 from Innova was a piece of cake to use. I have been shopping for a used truck and I used the 3030 to inspect each of the trucks for any stored faults. The colored lights on the tool (red, yellow or green) support the diagnostic trouble code information displayed on the screen to quickly tell you whether or not the vehicle has problems (red light) or is Ok (green light). 2 out of the 6 vehicles I have looked at had stored trouble codes, one of them was pending. I bought the truck and it has passed emissions with no problem. The green light lets you know that it will pass a smog test."
106322,1,"Look around.... you'll not find a pneumatic grease gun anywhere that can hit this price point.Works great, no complaints."
134655,2,"Be careful when ordering 'Spectre 5008B Magnabraid Hose Sleeving - 6-Feet Long', the description and picture are wrong and misleading.The picture shows 6 rolls but the packaging contains only 1.In the description you can read 'Diameter range of 1/2"" to 2""' and 'Includes clamps'. Unfortunately, there are no clamps included and the diameter range is wrong, on the package you can read item 5008B is for Radiator hose 1-1/4"" - 1-1/2"" I.D.I'm returning this item for a refund.Note also that the package warns the 6 feet of sleeving will cover approximately 4' to 5' of hose."
13926,0,"My husband is the one who uses these brushes to wash the cars, but he says the main brush is too soft to get the grime off the hood of the car. To be fair, the car was rather dirty at that point. The soap tube also collapses when you try and clean the top of the car, but I believe it is designed to do so. Perhaps I didn't understand the initial description. Overall it is a good product for the price. It gets the job done and if you're not picky, would be just fine."
45748,1,"I bought this alignment kit to replace what I THOUGHT was a broken Eibach kit. I had a lot of rattling in my suspension upon installation of the Eibach kit, but it turned out the noise wasn't related to my alignment kit at all.This Goldline kit looks identical to the Eibach and SPC kits (the 2 popular name brand kits for the 2000-2007 Focus), has the same build quality, looks to be made out of equally high-quality materials, and comes with all necessary hardware. I've had it installed for a few months now and it's holding up well.I'd recommend this kit to anyone because it's less expensive than buying the other brands, but is literally the same thing."
48771,1,The B&D; electric Air -Inflator works very good and is easy to set the pressure . I have tried other inflators and they were useless compared to this item.The only negative and it is minor is I would of liked to of seen a little larger storage compartment for the hose and the plug wire.
40850,1,A good product that works as advertised. Only two problems (1) the cord for the transformer to the keyboard is too short. Unless I drill a hole in my desk (which is shallow) the cord pulls the keyboard back to the edge of the shelf. (2) Because the green button goes off when the temp is reached I forget the keyboard is on heat and leave it on (the power switch is dark if the keyboard is warm enough and only shows the green light when it is heating.But it IS warm! Wish it came in black.
30140,1,The air fliter on my husbands bike was so bad (he just bought it used but previous ower haven't changed it since brought new) that he had to get new replacement. he looked everywhere but all were so high that we just couldn't afford it....that was till we found one on Amazon. I strongly recommend this product for the price and quality.
109737,1,"I just finished putting together a cylinder head for a honda civic (D15b7) The machine shop did not replaced the o rings for the valve train, so I had to put everything together and lubed the camshaft, I gave it a spin, and boyyy it rotates really smooth with this lube.!!! I lubed all moving parts, great product, I give it a 5 star.!!!"
36692,2,"When ordering, you can click on a link to confirm these fit your vehicle, and I did that. I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty and yes, they technically fit - you can hand tighten them on the stud, but when you try to tighten them with the lug wrench that comes with the Liberty, they do not fit the head of the lug wrench. The lug wrench fits the other lug nuts that are on the vehicle, just not these. So, I'd question that this is really an OEM part for a 2004 Liberty. In addition, they were not a perfect match as far as appearance, but I was going to use them any way, wouldn't have been that noticeable until I ran into the lug wrench issue. I'm not about to get into carrying two lug wrenches - I'll go to the Jeep dealer and pay their rip off prices. Oh, did I mention the two day order promise took four days?"
131709,0,"Nice little lights for the money but after putting 12v. to them, I discovered that the beam pattern is too diffused for the long range illumination I am seeking. It is more like a diffused flood/fog pattern with an X shaped hot spot in the center. If you want more of a medium range light (up to 100 yds.), these will work fine. Unfortunately, I had to modify the wiring harness to fit them to my MC so now I can't return them. I'll put them on *bay."
93967,1,VERY VERSTABILE. TURNS IN ALL DIRECTIONS. NOT CHEAP LOOKING. A REAL NICE KEY CHAIN. THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD.
11039,1,"I received exactly what was described. It was exactly what I wanted. I saved $200 on this item. I paid no shipping. I was well satisfied with the product, price and delivery."
55071,1,"Great charger, it is keeping my 8D batteries topped off. In the heat in FL I need to keep them topped when the boat is not in use. Great waterproof for outside use."
79832,1,Excellent Wipers. Works as well as advertised. Don't get snow where I am but works well with rain. Clear and streak free. So far so good. Recommend
151997,0,"Although not clear on the image; or in the description, This is the Plastic handle version of the California car duster.If I had known this prior I would have looked much much harder for the wooden handle version (which I also own)The wooden version is of much better quality in my opinion however this will do the job as intended.The thread quality seems similar (might be a little more sparse compared tot he other one) but the construction of the slip over section (where the handle mounts to the duster) is of much poorer quality.all in all; its the same unit which will work like the other one, but compared to the wooden handle version this is of much poorer quality, poorer handle construction and aesthetically is not as pleasing.do yourself a favour try to find the wooden handle one it is of much better construction quality, is nicer to hold and use (feels more balanced than this one) and in my opinion *looks* a million times better especially considering how much the price has increased since my last purchase!!The Original California Duster - Wooden Handle, 2 pack"
109672,1,"Bought this after the many stellar reviews.Applied the water repellent this afternoon to my VW Beetle ragtop.I way over applied the product on this little roof as my bottle was nearly empty by the time I got to the back end.It has rather a harsh smell but after it dries you don't notice it all.I was very careful to cover my paint and windows w/ a towel while spraying the product but was careless at my back window (glass not vinyl).After letting the 303 water repellent dry for several hours I went out to find I had horrible streaking down my back window.Grab the white vinegar and newspaper and clean like mad. No change.Maybe, just maybe my top has a leak around the window. I've had it less than a week and ran it through the carwash today to see if there were leaks.Clean the inside. Nope. It's the 303.The fun doesn't end there, I grabbed my IPhone and the towel I'd covered the car w/ in the same hand (not even damp) to find I had the same streak down the front of my screen. At least I've got a shield on my phone and now what appears a very clean streak.The car window not so much. Looks dirty as all get out.Emailed 303 and will report what they suggest.Update:Per my new best friend Roger @ 303, Bon Ami would do the trick, not actually having any I used hot water, baking soda and a little elbow grease.Came off easy as pie.A quick rinse and the canvas top is shedding water like off a ducks back.Roger reported the over application of the water repellent at worst would leave a powder not unlike talc but was easily rinsed off.My iPhone I noticed the next day was completely free of the weird streak.I must have simply rubbed it off with use.They've got a customer for life as far as I'm concerned.Fantastic customer service."
98792,1,"ordered this item , it arrived quickly. the construction is sturdy and the product is easy to install. fit easily on our vw jetta wagon"
120715,1,"The cord works well for the Ford Powerstroke application. Going straight forward along the frame rail and out by the fog lights works well. If you try to go up to the battery, it will work, but exercise caution when routing near the exhaust manifold. There is no need to use heat wrap if you are careful. If you think you might drive off with your vehicle plugged in, try not to secure it to other wire bundles!"
154718,0,"I bought this for a replacement wiper on my 2007 Dodge Caliber. Considering it is made by Bosch, I expected superior quality. This blade seemed to work pretty good for maybe the first month. After that, I can say it held up as well as cheaper blades from walmart. I was not very impressed with this product and honestly, would not spend the money on it again."
85043,2,"I've owned a set of this type before and they were great, but this one is not. There is no strap to hold it in place so every time you get in the car you have to prop the back part up again - more irritating if your hands are full or you're trying to get in just right with a skirt or coat on. Also this one only comes up to about the middle of my shoulder blades so it's very annoying to lean back on.Find one that has straps, is taller, and maybe even comes in a set. I know it's out there, I used to own it!"
96080,2,"I ordered this product because I wanted to be able to charge several different devices while camping. I had read reviews of small inverters and many didn't work. I didn't find negative reviews on this product. It arrived promptly. When I tried to use it, it was doa. I flipped the on/off switch several times and I would get an intermittant flash from the on switch on light but the unit never produced an output. I suspect it's just a defective switch."
144014,2,"it shows that fits bmw 318i wen it doesn't, I end up espending twice t money and a whole morning because its the wrong part"
133578,1,"I had an incident where I spilled gasoline on my scooter, which made streaks on the black plastic, running from the gas tank down to the foot rest. It looked horrible! I tried all kinds of things to remove the stain, to no avail. I went online and based on all of the positive reviews, I ordered Forever Black. It only took two applications to cover the stain and now my scooter looks new again. I would recommend this to anyone who is as fussy as I am about their vehicle. I am so happy to have found a product that actually does what it says it will do. Well worth the price."
85272,1,"Expensive! That's what a lot of people say about K&N; filters. However, they are typically less than the cost of two OEM filters, which are not reusable. So in the long run, you can (and do) save money. However, this particular filter (BM-1205) is no longer used in current vehicle production, so I was able to get it less than half of what it normally costs.Also, K&N; gets a lot of criticism for ""letting in dirt"" and for ""messing up MAF's"". If you use it and reoil it right, it performs just as well as an OEM filter. Its when you over oil it that you start messing up MAF's and when you don't do any maintenance on it is when it starts letting dirt through. I've used them in many of my vehicles over the years and have never had a problem. MY UOA's (used oil analysis) have come out clean over the years I've used this with minimal silicon being reported (silicon = dirt).Also, even though many report having an increase in power/torque/MPG's, I have not. So don't expect to, either. But you will save some money in the long run if you intend to keep your vehicle and you service this filter as recommended."
23127,1,I chose this O2 sensor for price and was impressed that it was an exact OEM match. This sensor was a good 30% less from Amazon than any local auto supply store. Highly recommend the Bosch sensor.
135598,0,"Bought this cable to replace a section of cable in my car and the interior diameter of the cable did not match the previous cable inner diameter. That being said, it still works fine for my setup, 600W RMS and I only had to replace about 2 feet of wire. If you have a more powerful setup you would need to get two of these or a cable with actual 4 AWG wire otherwise you might experience some performance loss."
94520,2,"Unfortunately I thought it was a good price and free shipping, but not the case. Found same ramps at local auto parts store cheaper. Even with sales tax I would have saved a few dollars."
157929,0,"I'm pretty picky about how my car looks after a wash. So take this with a grain of that salt. Generally I hose the car off, go over it with a bucket of soapy water and a mitt, rinse, and then towel it off with two towels (keeping one as dry as I can to get the spots off.)Yes, Mr. Clean AutoWash does more or less as what it says it does - you can skip the toweling dry. But there are a few spots here and there, and, unless you also wash the windows with windex, after a few days a white filmy scum develops on the windows (I presume it's on the car too but you don't notice it as much.)In terms of what's involved in washing the car, you still have to go over it with the soapy mitt and scrub off any bugs and droppings and get at the wheel covers, and that's the hardest part anyway. So I didn't find it took me all that much less time to wash the car in the end. Stack that against the cost of refills for the special soap and the filter and the extra step of having to spray it down with filtered water, and I don't think it's really worth it.That said, if you have fairly limited expectations for a car wash you do yourself (you aren't willing to settle for water spots, but you don't care if its absolutely perfect) then this might save you a little time."
87760,0,I bought the meter particulary for the dwell and rpm function. I tested both of these and found the rpm function did not work as it should have. I was measuring rpm on a 4 cylinder engine with the selector on 4 cylinders and the rpm reading was like 250 x 10 at idle. and was actually running like 600 rpms. So I'm pretty sure I wasn't doing anything wrong in the test. I can't give the rating 5 stars.
31932,0,"I love MaryJane's. I've had black patent leather ones before. These ones are not as comfortable as other ones I've owned but maybe I'll break them in and they'll feel better.They run a little small.

121122,2,"Easy to use in the configurations shown. However, 3 million candlepower doesn't do you much good when the battery needs recharging after no more than 15 - 20 minutes of use."
10147,1,"This is my third iteration of rain gear for riding. The first was a one-piece Tourmaster suit that leaked when a puddle would form in the crotch and cause water to get through the zipper. The second was an Alpinstar two-piece with a pull over anorak-type jacket. This one was waterproof, but I couldn't get the top over my armored leather jacket by myself. This Sentinel jacket works, is easy to get on, and packs away nicely in it's own pouch. I use the Alpinstar pants from the previous rain gear. I did have my wallet get wet in one of the pockets when riding in an all-day rain, but I stayed dry. The sizing allows for wearing over a jacket, so order your normal size."

Did I not pay for GREEN? That is what I took out of the car! That is what is pictured last year & today!The cabin filters, sold with it, are replacement inserts! FINE! That I kind of expected. BUT~ If they were, as pictured on the box, Arm & Hammer treaded! I would expect and I did expect more than WHITE see threw paper!Amazon needs to fix the picture here or send me the GREEN one as pictured! I paid for a GREEN filter & did not get it!"
166518,1,"Installed on a 2011 Kia Forte/Cerato with a Kenwood DDX4038BT head unit and works with all the buttons except the call end button. The buttons are less sensitive than with the stock head unit and takes time to register a command, but this is a common problem with most adapters. The installation is straight forward, although might require some soldering and wire splicing, as long as you read the vehicle specific instructions here [...]If you have a kenwood head unit, make sure the remote option in the settings is turned on."

Its a good cleaner, just too expensive, 409 works as well.(although I don't use 409 in my carpet shampooer.)"

51501,0,"Bought this item for our second home as we have two sets in our primary home and love it.After receiving and installing, one laser was dim and the second laser was VERY dim. Difficult to see both lasers. Generally you can see the laser lights very distinctly where they are pointed day or night.Amazon asked me to review this item and it was not worth returning for the price I paid. The Amazon email had a link to contact the seller which I did and explained what the item was doing and it was not worth returning. The seller promptly sent me a replacement which I received today and it seems to be working fine.I use the laser parking system everyday. It is great and as you set your stopping position, you just look for the laser where you set the stopping area. When you see the laser light on your predetermined spot, you stop.Would not recommend using batteries, since it has to be replaced about once a month. I just plugged mine into the garage door opener outlet with the included AC adapter on the ceiling and it works fine.Hope this helps with your purchase.Thanks"

185078,1,The TruXedo 277601 was a relatively competitively price cover for my Ford F150. Looks great on my pickup and was easy to install once my wife showed me how to fit a round peg in a square hole. Snug tight and no issues with leakage in rainy or snowy weather which is great for the area we live in.

But that was just delaying the inevitable...the thing flew off on the highway, fortunately not hurting anyone.So I liked it for 6 months but was disappointed that it was only held on with adhesive, which seems like an obvious failure point."
70586,1,"These are pretty much what I expected; I have no complaints. It was easy to cut to fit our compact SUV. It's thickness is good--about standard, I'd say, compared to ones I've seen at various stores--not flimsy or thin. The color is nice too (about what it is on my lcd monitor).It also shipped rather quickly."
95904,1,It does what it's suppose to at a price that beats any shop. All you need is a couple wrenches & a spring compressor.
75277,0,These did not fit 2001 Nissan Maxima AT ALL. I ended up taking off some of the edges thinking it would fit but it still didn't...too long and too much 'tuck tab' to fit in between weather stripping as the pieces should. Couldn't return once I mutated pieces :(DO NOT buy for 5th gen maxima.Can't speak for other vehicles.
179926,1,Had no probelems. Bolted right on and adjusted the idle mixture. Ran fine right away. Excellent carb with no fuel or vaccum leaks.
139826,2,"This works, but it sounds like an airplane taxiing along the tarmac. If I press on the gas or turn on the headlights the fan in this thing speeds up or slows down. I knew the fan was loud from reading the reviews, but I didn't think it would bother me because I'm not that sensitive to noise in my car since I listen to my stereo pretty loudly. However, I couldn't stand it and I couldn't find a location in my car where it didn't bother me. I even tried putting it inside the center console (bad idea for ventilation), but it was still too loud. I have no idea why they couldn't have designed this with a quieter fan. Also, it interferes with my stereo so that sometimes the stereo doesn't turn off when I take the keys out of the ignition. I'm returning it and looking for one without a fan."
123619,1,"My husband and I got this top carrier to help us on our trek from Georgia to Washington. There is enough space in it to fit just about the same amount of luggage that we would put in the back of our wagon. The waterproofing is EXCELLENT! We had torrential rains the first two days of our trip, and everything came through bone-dry."
29014,0,I was expecting something a little more heavy duty. Mind you I've had no problems. The mat fit great and is doing what it's supposed to do. The material is just a little on the thin side. It just seemed like the price I paid was a little high for what I actually got. It still looks great and cleans easily.
112467,2,I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package.
61364,1,It works great and the shipper had it here in 4 days with regular shipping. Took just a little modification to install but was done in 45 minutes. Holds tons of stuff that would otherwise have to be in a tool box or in back of truck unprotected.

She was looking for the silver one with pearls on it, but it's been out of stock so I decided to surprise her with this and if the gold looks ok on her silver colored car.

62692,0,"I recieved my new hitch on time. Problem was the box was what I ordered but the hitch inside of the box was not. Someone had switched hitches to a non slider type. Also some of the parts were missing(rails). I called Amazon and was able to get a credit for recieving the wrong hitch. Being resorceful I was able to use what was sent to me by using the slide portion of my old hitch, everything woked out ok in the end and I got to go on vacation as planned. 5 stars to Amazon for my quick resolution of this problem and getting me my $285.00 credit (the difference between what I orderd and what I got). No stars for the person who swaped out hitches in the box prior to me receiving it."
151081,0,I did not expect it to say FORD RACING on the back in big red letters... this was a let down because it was for a Ford Escape driver... Otherwise it appears to be a pretty decent keychain.
168063,0,As far as the product is concerned I was very happy with the product. The quality of the item is very good and fits my exhaust well.My complaint is the item was described as Heat Shields(PLURAL) This led me to believe I was buying two Heat shields and I was dissapointed when I opened the package and only found one SHIELD. So I think they should title there Item as Cobra Universal Heat Shield Not Shields.Had I known that I was only purchasing one item I would not have bought it.

84017,1,This is my second POD controller now and I wouldn't buy another kind. I frequently tow 8-10k lbs and this one was flawless. Don't be tempted by the digital ones that have a ball bearing in them. Solid state is the way to go so that it can be mounted any way. The simpler the better in my opinion.
60618,0,"One the plus side, the lock hardware itself feels pretty sturdy, more heavy duty than the mailbox lock I was expecting to see. The installation of the lock was very easy, but there are a few issues with the product that may be specific to my vehicle (2003 Chevy Silverado SS), but I suspect not. First off, the screw to attach the lock is too short, such that I could only get one or two threads into the lock. I will remedy this by buying a longer bolt, but I shouldn't have to. Second, the plastic bezel does not sit flush with the tailgate and feels like it's about to pop out. In addition, the lock cut-out on the bezel does not line up quite right with the lock. It's minor, but noticeable. Still trying to determine how to fix these issues. Lastly, it feels like if someone really wanted to break in, they would just pull the handle until something broke. I pulled it pretty hard, but not as hard as I could, and something was definitely about to break. I wish there was a better product on the market; I would gladly pay double the cost of this unit for one that worked well."

177817,0,I needed to winterize my RV and bought this kit. When putting on the PLASTIC cupling it broke. I had to go to the hardware store and spend $6.00 for a brass one. Almost half the price of the whole kit. The rest of it works fine.
89385,1,"I ordered this for my f-150 because I always leave my windows cracked to keep my truck cooler, since I live in Texas with the high heat. I would forget to roll my windows up when a storm would come so I ended up with puddles of water in my truck. Since I ordered this no water has gotten inside my truck even with the windows cracked...Works like a charm"
23040,2,The kit promises tail and side lights. It came with only the tail lights. They are fine and easy to install but I needed the amber sides. The picture and the product discription are not correct.

174278,1,"I bought this at a local shop on the recommendation of a clerk. This is a fabulous product. It really maintains my shoes. It does have a honey smell being made of propolis, but that does not bother me. It gives the product a more natural feel than other leather polishing productions. I often apply this with my bare hand and then brush the shoe off after it is thoroughly worked in. The product washes off my hands with a little soap and warm water. The leather is left looking great and pliable. This is not for glossy leather. Matte type leathers work best."
148005,1,"they look sharp , very nice looking seat covers , good fitting also ! I would but another pair if I need to..."
140508,0,"I bought this unit after getting a reject sticker on my truck. It will tell you where the problem is in the system, but it won't tell you exactly what the problem is. So your going to have to have some experiance with engine repair. My problem is with the egr system and after replacing modules, valves, solenoids, air breather, the check engine light still comes on and it still is telling me I have a problem with egr. Perhaps it's a leaky hose or something, but the unit will give you a basic idea where the problem lies. But it's up to you to find exactly what is wrong. If you do find the problem and fix it, it's cheaper than several hours in the shop at $100.00 an hour."

173866,2,"Installed these pads on brand new Brembo rotors. Since then my wheels are filthy with barke dust, with reduced stopping power. I've bled the brakes to eliminate any air in the system, even though there was no way for air to enter the system during pad installation. They claim they are dust free with 70% increase in stopping power. Not on my 2000 4Runner! Going to replace them with genuine Brembo pads."
91813,0,For some reason this particular sized wiper blade is not so easy to find. I purchased this for a Ford Escape. Installation was tricky as the blade has been redesigned (I've used this brand for as long as I've owned my Escape and never had trouble installing until now). You practically have to bend the metal frame in order to install this on your wiper arm. Thankfully the rear blades don't need changing very often!
181521,0,Overall its is great. Only flaw is that it isn't as black as i wanted it to be. Its kind of a black gray type.

39060,2,"I bought this for my dad who wanted to use it to sell some cars and wow is all i can say. This thing, whatever it is...is terrible. I bought two and when they came in the mail, they were stuck together and the backing of one pealed and was glued to the other and Couldn't get it out. the one that was good when written on and tried to wipe off, It didn't come off. you can smell the cheap spray paint that was used on this product. Maybe they just rushed the production and didn't wait for the paint to dry. either case It was terrible."
185319,0,"The Tourmaster/Cortech DSX denim motorcycle pants are what I was looking for to ride in the warmer weather. They are comfortable while riding since they seem to be more breathable than the padded motorcycle pants that I usually wear. Denim, though, can be really oppressive in the hot humid weather when you finally get to your destination.I find that the plastic knee protectors (which are removable) tend to bother me when walking around because the top of the protector hits the bottom of my knee cap unless I pull the pants way up around the top of my waist. In that case I take the protectors out."
37589,1,this tool works a lot better than a piece of rope like the old school days- it held the valve closed so i could get the spring replaced

29579,2,"Don't let Amazon's part finder fool you. This product will not fit into a stock 2000 Subaru Impreza wagon. It is way too small. I had to walk a ways to the auto parts store to replace this as I had my car apart when I was installing this filter. Really disappointed with Amazon for car part purchases. 2 out of 3 things did not fit when their part finder said it did.This 2 star review is not an indicator of the quality of the product. Product appeared to be of high quality. Make sure you read up on how to properly clean and oil the filters. You can gum up your mass airflow sensor if you screw it up, which is not a cheap fix (buy some $5-7 MAF safe cleaner just to be on the safe side...it is cheaper than paying someone $200 to ""fix"" it)."
10193,2,"This unit has some attractive features, but did not last long. The temperature sensor MUST be mounted in precisely the right location, or you will get wildly erroneous readings. Product quit functioning after 6 months"

77880,0,"Wipers seem to work fine after several rains. They are highly recommended by Consumer Reports. My only disappointment is that the plastic blister packaging was not of a readily recyclable type. Post consumer, recycled cardboard would have been better still."
81396,0,"Works OK if you watch carefully what you are doing. Mine came with missing bolts in badly damaged carton (missing bolts easy enough to remedy). The red strap broke once (the stiching gave gave way where it was sewn onto itself to make a loop), lucky there were no injuries when it gave way, I was able to simply tie it onto the hardware it was sewn around. The lifting of snowmobiles was made ""do-able"" with this device and the adjustment to different machines was quite easy. Also you must carefully watch the strap so it that does not get pinched between the pulley and frame, you will become very frustrated in having to partially disassemble the lift to make it function again. As one of the most expensive lifts out there the Instructions/drawings leave a lot to be desired. I got most the most useful information from the tiny picture on the carton (lucky that wasn't too beat up)."
35044,1,When it comes to car-audio installs I only use real copper ring terminal like these instead of buying cheap aluminum with the fake gold plating terminal from the so called car-audio company's and paying $3-$4 for a pair. For the price and quality Pico has been a solid company for many years. I have and would recommend this product to anyone that doing work on there car audio systems.
2822,1,The filters were received on time and are of good quality.I appreciate the great service of the Amazom Fulfillment Team.
54962,1,Had this unit for about a year now and has been working flawlessly since I got it. The Ranger has a gel battery that takes a lot of driving to keep charged so this was a great solution. I installed it directly onto the posts and keep the small unit under the hood. I attached it with some industrial velcro and just have the plug in hanging out the bottom.. similar to having a engine heater plug. Then I just keep an extension cord plugged in at all times outside until I need to go for a spin. It has always been ready to go and starts right up. Unit is compact and worth every penny!Thanks Amazon!

55985,1,"Tore my clutch apart on my quad in my cold garage. Kept these gloves on for most of the job and they did great. They aren't a winter glove.

164477,2,It's not comfortable. It moves too easily. It's too small. It is overpriced. Save your money and buy a good boat cushion. They are more comfortable.
118408,1,Well worth the price. Was able to charge my cell phone on a long motorcycle trip. Also used it to charge my mp3 players while riding.
74,1,"Fits perfectly on my car. Did not know what a puddle light is, it is a light underneath the mirror that lights up if a door is left opened. Does not exactly match my other mirror for that reason. Allowed my car to pass inspection, and that's what mattered."
180680,1,The leather pants are great. I had read from others to order them about 1 size bigger than you normally wear in the waist. I went w/ a 32. They fit like they were taylored for me. They were on sale too!
22582,1,"This is a very easy bag to rig to your bike. I have an 06 honda sabre with a Mustang Seat. This bag is roomy, with a very nice backrest. If I had one little criticism it might be that I don't fully trust the velcro straps that hold the bag to the seat. I simply supplement them with bungee cords. I used this bag on a 2000 mile trip last summer without a hitch. The backrest helped make the long-stretches tolerable. With the bungee straps it was also rock-solid in crosswinds. At one point I was in a crosswind so strong it literally ripped my magnetic tank bag off the bike............The Kurakyn Grantour was rock solid."

20274,1,"My new-to-me 1996 Toyota Corolla doesn't hold modern thermal coffee cups - the base on them is too large to fit. Also the pull out 2-cup holder in the Corolla blocks the storage cubby area on the dask and also the power adapter. The car is small and there aren't a lot of places to place a cup.I read about these cup holders that mount in the vents. The reviews said they are strong and stable and easy to install. The price seemed OK, not so much that I would be annoyed if they didn't work out. I ordered two and have had them a week.In short, these are pretty good. They install easily (watch out the springs that hold the clips steady against the vent don't slip out while you install them in the vents), and have a simple but strong pull-out plastic tab on the bottom that pushes against the dash that actually support the weight of the cups and also holds the cup holder level. The tab adjusts easily for any angle dash and locks into place, just push a little button to move them. The holders are easy to remove if needed, just tilt them up and slide back out from the vent. You can tilt the holders up easily without removing them if you need to access the vent open/close control which is otherwise blocked by the cupholder.These cup holders actually look pretty snazzy, even a little sporty.That's all good. The bad is that it is still not large enough to hold my thermal coffee cups or any of the fancy ones you buy at Starbucks. I have to use a mug that is wide at the top but squeezes down a lot at the bottom. These are commonly found. Disposable cups from Dunkin Donuts fit fine, they taper at the bottom. 12 ounce water bottle fits, too, but not larger ones.Overall, these are pretty good and they give me a decent way to hold my cups in my small car that doesn't have adequate holders of its own. I recommend them."

136881,2,"Just received this and decided to put it on the trailer. The box was in rough condition and someone had taped up one side of an end. That should have prepared me. When I tilted the box, the posts and mounting frames came out and then an empty cardboard parts holder. Someone had ripped open the plastic wrap. I gently tilted the box further and the nuts, washers and screws came out. Unfortunately, only half the nuts were there and 3 lock washers were missing.This means I have to go to home depot and try to match up the nuts and washers. This is more of an inconvenience than a cost or product misfunction. But somebody packed it that way and it was pure laziness and poor business practice. I wouldn't purchase from them again most likely. Too bad, because the item looked to be of decent quality."

Also as others have stated it was shipped just in a bag.This company did contact me offering to ship the terminal adapters if I would remove this review. However, probably should have sent it with the battery in the first place if you are going to send something different than what was advertised."
4586,1,"First of all, this is a GREAT product. It changed the way I drive. It operates on the principle of ""Hey Dummy you are getting less miles a gallon at your speed so slow down"". I know everyone with a brain knows driving slower saves more gas but looking at the real time milage does something to you. Unfortunately you have to spend money and buy this product to experience this. I used to get 400 miles per gas tank, but now I get almost 500 miles. There are enough reviews on this product so I will review how to buy this product from Amazon instead. I placed this item in my cart at one hundred nineteen dollars (Amazon does not allow me to put numeric pricing for obvious reasons aka censorship) but did not buy it right away. The next day when I was about to purchase it, the price showed one hundred fourty-nine dollars! WTH? I then removed it off my cart and refused to be a victim of Amazon's product price games. Later that day, when I searched for it again on Amazon I saw the lower one hundred nineteen dollars. I then purchased it right away. If you want this at a lower price and can wait a few days or more, just place it in your cart and wait for the price to drop. Its a no brainer that the product pricing on Amazon is just like the stock market as it goes up or down in price. I can't promise you that it will be one one nine again, but you should see it lower than the current one five nine price. Good Luck!"
53010,1,"These days, if a car thief is savvy enough, they can steal just about any car they want. The nicest car alarms can't keep your precious travel device from going home with the wrong kind of people. So the idea here, is to make your car as inconvenient to steal as possible.If you put one of these in your car/truck/suv/etc, you are effectively making it really annoying to steal your car. Impossible to steal? No, but if your vehicle has one of these on the brake pedal and the guy next to you with same car doesn't... Who do you think is gonna be the target?This thing is a pain in the butt to put on and take off of a tiny car like mine. I have a Subaru Impreza, but imagine how difficult it is going to be to get the thing off in a hurry without the key?? It would attract a sizeable amount of attention to say the least. I imagine that if someone broke into my car, saw the thing and started messing with it, they would probably get frustrated and seek out easier prey.So if you're looking to make your vehicle as inconvenient as possible to deter those with less than good intentions, look no further. You have found the most annoying physical lock you can use. It is really heavy and doesn't exactly fit anywhere in a normal sized car, so keep that in mind when you purchase the brake lock."

Instead you'll need to install an accessory power socket with at least the same amp rating as the inverter's fuse.These accessory sockets are often sold with battery clamps on them for direct attachment to a battery, but some models of accessory sockets can also be directly wired to a spare fuse slot on your vehicle's fuse panel and mounted on or under the dash. Many vehicles have 2 or 3 spare fuse circuits available for add-on electrical accessories like this.If you are not comfortable doing work on your vehicle's electrical system yourself, I suggest contacting a car audio business to see if they can install one of these accessory sockets for you, or if they can direct you to someone in your area who can."

74418,2,"I really wish I had just purchased roof racks and a Thule/Yakima cargo box instead of this. The straps go through the doors which doesn't work if you're tall, and the car clip straps scratched my car up. The straps also didn't stay tight, which led to the bag flying off my car at 70mph... Tore up in several places. Thank god no one was behind me at the time or they could have been killed. You can also only store lightweight stuff in it or it will dent in your roof.Complete waste of money in my opinion... Do yourself a favor and spring for quality roofracks and a cargo box."
115521,1,There is not much more to add to this discussion. I just want to state that this is a sufficiently rugged and well-built splitter. I am very pleased with it.
119459,1,"I installed shortshots on my bike and damn....it was loud. For Cali regs, I would have gotten tickets. I strongly recommend these baffles just to tone down if you have straight pipes. When I took my bike for a spin, it sounded nice and toned down and still have that sound that tell everyone you are coming. Shipping from Amazon was 2 days earlier than expected and cheaper compared to other websites. Get them, you wont regret it."

106196,1,"It took a minute to swap out this air filter on my 2006 Suzuki 700Kingquad. I noticed an immediate difference... The idle was improved, the accelaration was improved, and no hiccups like I was experiencing with the stock paper filters. So far, so good. K&N products are well worth the money."
161574,1,"What can you say about chains... I like the SCC V Bar chains as they are far superior on ice than traditional links. They also give you a little more life out of your chains, as they have to wear down the V Bar first before getting to the chain."
154049,2,Title is deceptive. States that it is plural to deceive you since they usually come in 6-packs but I only received 1 even though it says PLUGS.
38808,1,"Excellent item,Killer Price,fast shipping.Amazon seems to be stepping upon their free shipping,Good Job Amazon. Again the price was excellent."
65323,1,Never had a bad item made by K&N. Always fit well and increased MPG. Can't ask for much better than that.
64193,2,Don't buy Mr. Clean AutoDry. The manufacturer (P&G) discontinued the soap and filters. This item is now useless.
48646,1,"Just got it....I'm loving the auto shut off. It does, however, sorely need a carrying handle. How they didn't think of that, I'll never know. Maybe I can fashion one and glue it on or something, don't wanna go redneck on it though, heh. Other than that, so far so good."
5813,0,"It is cheap, and it does what it is required to. Not super precise, not very convenient to use, but good as a quick solution."
98516,0,"These could have ""Custom Fit"" my 2000 Silverado a bit better than they did but with some minor scribe-and-trim they look good."
145661,2,"I had a set of these for about one year before one burned out. A common complaint. I was also disappointed as soon as I installed them. They are tinted blue to give the ILLUSION of whiter light, but they are really just blue bulbs. They are probably overvolt bulbs to burn brighter to compensate for the light absorbed by the coloring. That would explain the short life. Would you rather see better or look better? That's what you have to decide before you spend a premium for these. It was money wasted for me. GE Nighthawks have been a better alternative; a little brighter without the blue nonsense."
70183,0,"This is a well built and decent mobile emergency air system. The only real problem is the lack of a long enough power cord to reach the locations I need the air in a lot of my situations. I pull a big horse trailer and there is simply no way I can make it reach the trailer tires from the under hood batteries!! A cigarette lighter power plug adapter would also be nice and avoid having to get under the hood, would make reaching at least the rear tires of a big pickup easier!"
17050,0,"This is not the one you want if you are starting fires with it. It's noisy and wimpy on air flow. Go with the Air Grill Blower. It is cheaper, quieter, and moves about twice as much air per crank."
45197,1,"very happy with this product. installed it immediately on my 1990 toyota celica. Very easy to install, even though the instructions are roughly translated. great improvement over stock shift knob. the stainless steel-like material gets very cold in the winter. however, it is much easier to shift. THIS IS A SCREW-ON KNOB, NOT A BOLT ON. It is solid and will not easily fall off or come off the shifter. This shift knob is a lot smaller than i expected.anyways, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, IT PAYS FOR ITSELF."
84791,1,"I have finally used up a tube of Gs27 that I bought at Target about 10 years ago. I've used it on dings, scuffs and scratches on my white Oldsmobile Alero and my gold Honda Accord. It never ceases to amaze me how well it works! Just last night I applied it to a parking lot ding on my driver's side door that had left a 5 inch smear of white paint and a divot (and left the other driver with some bad karma). Within 30 seconds my door looked perfect again with the exception of a nearly imperceptable dimple.This stuff works like magic!"
45809,0,"On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 7. I find this gauge to be difficult to use and open. The feelers themselves are great, but the packaging is the problem. The ""case"" is flimsy and bends easy. once it is bent, you cannot slide the feeler gauges back in. Eh, you get what you pay for."
136478,1,I just threw this 71mm Wiseco into my 1974 Suzuki TS250. Wiseco makes nice stuff and you'll pay for it. The old Suzuki piston was fine and it was cast. I went with Wiseco because it was only about 20 dollars more than the OEM cast piston. Was it a good decision? I don't know. Ask me in 39 years if it lasted as well. The thing I like about Wiseco is their support network. If you have questions you can call them and talk to someone that knows what is going on. The machining tolerances are listed on the box so you know how much to bore your cylinder and what to gap the rings to. I suppose Wiseco doesn't need much more of an introduction since everyone knows who they are.
140735,1,We had check engine lights pop up on two vehicles in one week. This device saved us a ton of money. We were able to fix the problems on our own and save the trips to the mechanic. It is easy to use and the codes are available online.
165237,1,"I got these for Christmas this year and they are amazing. Installation is REALLY easy, just plug it into your fuse box and done. It's only 3 main colors but they mix together great and make the other 4 seamlessly. My ONLY complaint is that the setting where it goes with the music doesn't really go along with the beat, but what can you expect when it's not wired to the music player right? Overall, amazing product, very satisfied. Just make sure you set apart about an hour or so to hide all the wires haha"
88065,0,"These are not a perfect fit, but look pretty good and do the job. Next time I will order the actual OEM floormats, because these do not fit perfectly and slip a little. Nothing that makes driving difficult, but just not perfect. The color and quality are good, but if you are looking for the fit of the original mats that came with the car, these come close, but will not be perfect."
93630,2,I purchased this item thinking it was the right size for the existing mirror. WRONG It fits on the mirror but alot smaller than what it should be. You can see out of it but looks like crap and is obviously a missmatch. It also came through with a chip out of one corner
162263,2,I bought these LEDs because my car puts out low voltage power in the tail lights. They worked fine at first. But after a few times lowering my boat into the the water I noticed the several lights not working. On further inspection I realized the lights were full of water. I drained and dried them but now only one or two lights work. I checked the ground and everything looks fine so it must be the lights. They look pretty rusted out. Not very submersible if you ask me.
105891,1,Fit just right and got better gas mileage. Easy to in stall and maintain. Now if I could find a cheeper exhust system.
3115,0,The top came on time and fit well. Seems the seller forgot to mention it was a second or defective. Bestop forgot to cut the vinyl away on the inside of the rear window. Does provide privacy in the rear seat but not much scenery. Be careful what you order.
169074,0,i had to cut more away from the eyes and nose to keep my glasses from fogging up while riding my motorcycle
8663,0,"LOOKS NICE,FITS GREAT! THE PROBLEM IS IF THERE IS ANY WIND,SUCH AS WHEN YOU DRIVE! THE COVER LIFTS IN THE MIDDLE.WHAT I DID WAS TO TAKE THE COVER TO A FRIEND WHO HAS AN AUTO SEAT COVER SHOP AND HAD HIM CUSTOM MAKE A CENTER SECTION."
168761,0,"- The handle is pulled off when I try to pull it. The hooker is not hard enough. It is bended when I used it to pull. Overall, not recommended!!"
21013,1,The product works great and looks good on my 2002 Windstar.Great price! Took a while to find one. Glad it fit.Thank you for reading my review.
94007,1,installed helicoils on my boat motor's lower unit as i broke all 5 stainless steel mounting bolts and had to drill the bolts out of the unit. installed the helicoils and everything worked out fine. amazon had a good price and the free shipping was a plus. love using amazon when i get the chance.
136543,1,Made to sit on a seat or floor but I purchased it to sit inside my center console compartment. It adds a lot of organization to a catch all area. This unit is cleverly made in that the compartments are movable to suit your storage needs. The walls are stiff and secured with generous velcro tabs. Configured several ways from two long pockets to six small pockets. Nice to use and I'm glad I found it. Reasonably priced and shipped fast.
4264,1,"For the 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid, this is the filter for the battery cooling system. This filter installs in the rear cargo area. (There is a small panel on the driver's side of the rear cargo area. Remove this panel, then another panel immediately behind the first one, then slide out the filter.) This is not the air filter for the passenger heating and cooling system. If you're looking for a filter for the passenger HVAC, you want Motorcraft FP66. There is some confusion surrounding these two filters because they're both listed as ""cabin air filter"" in the Ford parts catalog."
110984,0,All the lights turn on fine. The issue I have is: 1) The lights do not keep a memory of previous setting after power has been turned off. 2) Sometimes 2 of the led's will turn on as soon as power is connected. You have to turn off the light and then back on to clear this. 3) I think the cable that runs from the light to the control box should be longer as well as the power cable. The brightness is fine. You will see more light in a line in the direction the LED's are pointed. The neon tubes tend to reflect in all directions. But if the LED's hold up to their background they should never die in my lifetime or length of time I have my car.
176327,1,It's kind of cheap. I gave it as a gift so I'm not sure how long it will last.
51797,1,"My thoughts on this were twofold: First, a windshield sun blocker is only good when the car is parked. Longer drives around town and whatnot leave the dashboard in the sun. Since I live in New Mexico where the sun shines all year and is quite intense I knew I had to have something to cover the dash.While this is thinner and more lightweight mat than I originally wanted, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it."
92182,0,"I don't like the plastic swivel anchors they use in wiper blades nowadays. If you bump them with an ice-scraper, or let the wiper snap back onto the windshield too hard, it breaks the reatiner clip. Then, when you really need your wipers the most, it comes loose from the wiper arm. In my case, the metal wiper arm ran a big scratch across my windshield. Now, I look for all-metal blade bodies."
49507,1,"Just returned from a trip to Myrtle Beach (600 miles each way) and was impressed withthis bag. Lots of room, easy to secure to roof and no noise of any kind while traveling.No rain so I can't comment on that but for the money I'm very happy with my purchase."
123305,0,"The assembly fits well, but is much more noisy than the original. In fact, I had to turn up the radio to hear over the blower.Update. It has gotten quieter."
176338,2,"It was a lot cheaper feeling than I thought it was going to be for $10. I didn't realize it was just really light plastic. It also had terrible adhesive, and fell off of my car after about a day without any precipitation. It's currently sitting in my glove box because I apparently need to buy new adhesive because the old one simply does not stick."
123123,1,"The color is brighter than the picture would indicate. The 2&#34; drop isn't rated at 7500# like it shows, it is rated at 6000#. The 4&#34; drop mount is more like a 3 1/4&#34; drop, but is rated at 7500#. Other than that, it works, the powdercoating is done well, and it still looks good on the back of my Ram."
112561,2,"Looking at the price, and knowing a bit about electronic circuits, I did expect that this unit would cut the power off at let's say 10.5V and restore it at 12.3V. In this scenario it would cut the cooler off as the battery gets low and it would fire it back up as the engine runs and the alternator is charging the battery.This is NOT the case and here is why this switch is totally useless and probably damaging/reducing the lifespan of connected coolers or other equipment on top of it.As the voltage gets critical it will cycle on and off. Like the turn signal, but much faster. This is very disappointing and I can not not express how mad I am that a company is selling such a cheap circuit for such a high price. This unit is not doing/working how it should.If I did not get a broken item (I doubt it, reading some other reviews) someone could feel this is like highway robbery. I did try to call the company and after being on hold for quite a while I was getting tired of it and just sent the item back.Bottom line:Don't get this item. The idea is good, this particular one is not what it should be. Wait for another ""battery saver"". They are hard to find and I did not find anther one yet."
91483,1,"This product does just what it is supposed to do. Be sure and notice how to roll it back up, however! There is a button on the side--it's not like a traditional window shade that you tug on."
120109,2,"I bought this based on the specs for my Jeep's rear windshield wiper. It's too small for one, though it's the size specified. For another thing, it doesn't bend to the glass at all. It wipes only about four inches in the middle of the rear window."
117166,2,"I am disappointed in that the picture looks different than the actual item. I thought I'd be able to bolt it right on ... but because it's not the same, I now have a big hassle. I have to decide whether to sell it locally or eat a ton on the shipping cost, all because the picture isn't accurate. I imagine the muffler is fine but it's clearly been misrepresented."
156906,0,"I deducted (2) stars because this product was made in China, whereas other Bosch windshield wiper products are manufactured in Germany or Belgium. Amazon should start listing this information. However, if country-of-origin doesn't matter to you as a consumer, read on.Bracketless wiper means the rubber blade is not suspended in the ubiquitous metal frame. The blade is attached to a strong yet flexible length of plastic with a bulb in the center to hook your wiper. Unlike traditional wipers, the dual springs keep the blade real taut -- the whole wiper is bowed out of the package -- and it hugs the surface of the window evenly its entire length. Wiper action is butter smooth and quiet, zero streaking.Good spring/summer/fall wiper. Stick to a metal bracketed wiper for ice and snow where this sort of product does not perform well. In anything other than rain or light snow I give it (2) stars."
110871,2,"These wipers are worthless!! In fact they might end up costing you a ton of money when you have to replace your windshield. I bought a pair that came apart completely, leaving bare metal on my windshield..... AND THIS AFTER 3 MONTHS with MAYBEE 5 days with rain...."
66185,2,"The spout on this particular model is a complicated spring loaded device that, at least in my 2 samples, broke at first use. Ended up having to pour directly from the can with no spout into a funnel. Oh yeah, spilled gas and oh yeah, these cans are going into the trash.Useless junk."
67142,1,Product was as advertised. Fit perfectly. Came with two keys. I saved 8 dollars over purchasing from an auto parts store.
156692,1,"Fit was perfect for my application, cant go wrong with a Bosch replacement, I strongly recommend this item for foreign cars many come with them as original equipment."
156176,1,"I am not going to tell you why I like this product, but if you have an imagination, you might be able to figure it out."
78255,1,Good product; matched the description; Arrived on time & was in a sturdy box for shipment. Easy to use and stays on the chain.
834,0,I had one of these on my previous vehicle. I was looking forward to this one for my new Honda Element. The quality from my previous Stant Locking Fuel Cap has decreased. My last one lasted close to 8 years. This one feels like it won't last 2 years. I am worried when it fails that I won't be able to get into my gas tank.
128865,1,"Could barely get my wife to go 100 miles on my origial seat. We rode 220 miles today with ease! We were both so comfortable. This is the most comfort I've ever had on a motorcyle, and I've been riding 24 years. Has a removable backrest for me (driver) that makes long trips amazingly comfortable and no more back straining. Shipping was amazingly fast, I was really supprised how fast it came. The quality of the seat is superb. Was going to get the Mustang at first, but I tried one for a week or so on my previous bike and it moved me up too much in the seat and was way too mushy, but some like that. The Saddlemen has gel in it somewhere, and the seat has a very different feel than most seats. It's not mushy at all, but almost hard, but when sitting on it, the gel really works. I am sold on the Sadlemen seats!"
86759,1,"What do I need to say here? It arrived in great shape, it plugged in just fine. It lite up."
29700,1,The Optima Battery is the best battery to buy if you want to make sure there is no corrosion or leakage.
51616,0,"Company could do a better job of making a real ""full protection wrap-around"" deflector that actually protects the entire front lip of the hood area.This unit, purchased for a 2007 Honda Odyssey, is nice looking and tall enough but only covers the front-center portion of the hood -- not above the top of the headlights to the left and right edges of the hood.In todays tech world, this can be accomplished. This is nothing more than a lack of will on the part of the products leading mfg in this area! Probably would not buy again."
2930,2,Pile is not as deep as the original lexus product. Matting on back of one piece was falling away. Color was as represented.Would not buy this product again.
175384,2,"This will be a mixed review of sorts.I bought an Optima SC35DA Yellow Top directly from Amazon in August of 2009 and it worked fine until March of 2011. The plastic around the negative battery post just split with gas and gel oozing out.I did not think there was any problem because this Optima battery comes with a three year full replacement warranty.Now the warranty merry go round started.I called Amazon and I was told to call Optima, Optima told me they would not warranty the battery because Amazon is not an authorized reseller, so back to Amazon, then back to Optima and so on.The final result is that Amazon wound up giving me a full refund of the purchase price of the battery. I would rather of had a new battery but I got tired of the BS and aggravation and then I did what others did, I went to a local discount store and bought a cheap battery.What is the point of spending $174.00 on what is supposed to be the best battery only to have it fail very early in its life cycle and then have to argue over getting it replaced?The Optima battery worked for less than two years. So why spend the money on one when you can buy a Wal-Mart special for less than half the price, get it replaced locally or just throw it out and buy a new one.I do have to thank Amazon for finally giving me the refund but there was too much aggravation involved. From all of the complaints I have read about the lack of a warranty when the Optima Battery is bought from Amazon, you would think Amazon would stop selling it.This is exactly why I gave it only one star.I can only recommend that no one should by any Optima Battery Product from Amazon unless they are fully aware that there is no warranty at all."
114376,1,"This is one of the best car washes I've ever used. What surprised me is how great this stuff smells! It's really a nice touch when washing your car to have such a pleasant odor, no joke. But the bottom line is that this does a great job of cleaning the car without anything hazardous to your vehicle. I use this on my Porsche Boxster S and know many other Porsche owners who swear by it for good reason.Cheers"
105256,1,"I will caveat this by saying I am no car professional. I don't buy a lot of break pads, nor work on cars on a regular basis, but I do LOVE a good running and CLEAN car! After looking up many different models of brake pads for my Mercedes, the review on this one kept coming back strong, with frequent comments of less brake dust. Well, I am a natural skeptic...but I totally agree. I can definitely see the difference between the factory pads that I replaced and these. I have been driving on them for about 5000 miles now and that has remained true from day 1. I will buy these again if I need to replace my brakes."
85066,2,The item that I ordered which was described as a blue CANVAS boat cushion turned out to be a blue NYLON boat cushion that I could have purchased at Wal-Mart for $7.00. After payin shipping I paid over $16.00 for the same thing. This is a boat cushion that I have been looking for and have been unable to find and I thought that I had found it here. I thought that after reading the description that I would get what was decribed... Not soTherefore I am Not happy with this service and will not use it again.
13456,1,"Easy to follow instructions, quick installation. Arrived very quickly and was as described. Would definitely buy from this company again."
184917,2,"This fairlead looks like it is a good quality but it broke at the very first use, lifting a snowplow.The bottom roller was completly crushed by the weight.I wrote to the compagny, to get another roller.They didn't respond.So i just turned the fairlead upside down to get another chance and i'm and waiting for the 2nd snowstorm.Good luck with that!"
58316,0,"This product claims it can fit an '01 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, but it doesn't. When I compared the length of this belt to the one I took out it was about 2-3 inches smaller. The belt itself seemed to be of good quality but not the right size for my truck."
149466,1,Loved this screen overall. It makes the bike look so much better compared to the stock screen that was transparent.Only complaint is the stickers that come on the screen...it's a pain to take them off :|
181712,0,"I love the look, but it's not very water proof at all and when you wash it or it rains it gets inside. Hasn't taken out any bulbs yet though so I guess it's fine once it drys out. Just be careful if you are buying in a rainy city."
164415,0,"The description is very accurate. It is a FIRM in all caps &#34;cushion.&#34; I am not the lightest, about 215 lbs, and this cushion was too firm for me. My chair has about 1.5 years on it and the seat is a little worn. This did little to remedy the firmness my chair was providing. I would personally look for a softer cushion, but if super firm cushions are your thing this will definitely deliver"
184240,1,"I've only had this radiator for about 3 months, so my review is quite inconclusive, but at this point I can say that the radiator fit perfectly in my 2001 Subaru Forester and seemed to be of a higher quality build. No leaks or other related problems."
143362,1,"Haven't gotten that far yet, but it looks like a quality product. More later if needed. Service was good."
170367,2,"Another one cursed with the incessant, extremely shill beeping. Read the directions 20 times.This thing is expensive garbage.Black & Decker blew it."
168634,2,"the pic on this site looks like an h1 bulb, but when i got mine, the box says h7 and its also labeled on the bulb housing. AMAZON, pls double ck before you ship items out. h1 isn't an h7 bulb. this really sucks as i like hella bulbs, but, i may have to go with philips on this one. now, i have to go to the post office to mail back the box. wasted time and gas."

176064,0,"The clamp itself is fine, very heavy and well plated. However, in the bag was a chromed 7mm Allen head bolt and one washer, but the nut was not in the bag. Real hassle because the thread pattern/size in not common and had a hard time finding a nut.Thought about returning or contacting where I purchased it but that would waste time I did not have. I ended up not using the supplied bolt and got a nice looking chromed nut and bolt from my motorcycle dealer.Not real happy with this product."
126425,1,"Shipment was fast and the wiper blade works like a charm, just like many reviews said it would. My only gripe is that the wiper spoiler doesn't have the PIAA label on them like shown in the picture. I bought it partially for the look and the wiper spoiler picture showed it to be aesthetically pleasing. Function over form, i guess."
56410,1,"I towed a Jeep Wrangler over 1000 miles with this tow bar and it worked great. It was easy to install and hook up. It came 90% assembled. I may have missed it in the directions, but make sure you tighten all the coupler bolts after you hitch it to your vehicle. They are loose to allow for multiple in installations, but all bolts on the bar need to be tight for towing. Making sure the bar is level is also important. This is a great product and it showed up before its due date. Including safety chains would have been nice and worth extra money. I spent over $20.00 making my own."
131957,1,This Radiator fit my car (2002 Nissan Max) perfectly and so far no issues to report. I had no problems reconnecting the hoses. The one thing that is different is the Screw sizes that mount the Fan to the Radiator. The OEM screws are too big. Luckily i had screws that fit the bolt and holes.
171895,1,If you are ready for wax on and wax of for like a 5 session the product will do the job my car was scratch with a key and very dip so the dealer give me some matching pen paint I used the pen paint leaved for 3 days then used the scratch for about 5 times and my car look like nothing ever happen. the scrath absobe the extra paint and leave the mark invisible. So like I said there is no miracle you have to worked out.

If you install it, by no means should it be set up to be activated when the engine is turned on..use the switch or headlight option.(You would not want to be sitting at a stoplight in town with this thing screaming...) It is a bit annoying even inside the car--you have to turn the radio up. However, I drive deer-infested roads and am willing to put up with most anything if it will keep these ""rats with antlers"" off my windshield!!"
173559,0,"I have the new LG Shine and got a few scratches on the surface. I went looking on the net to see who recommended what to get rid of scratches, and a few websites recommended IceCreme. I bought it and gave it a try.Long story short, if you want to put a lot of elbow grease into it, give this stuff a shot. But the scratches on my phone still remained after twenty minutes of buffing. I tried it on my ipod and the stuff made a more significant difference on that as opposed to my phone - it made the scratches less apartment, but they didn't miraculously go away. All-in-all it requires a lot of work for a minimal amount of improvement"
146313,0,"The sound quality is very disappointing, worse for me than dollar store radios. Between the speaker and the tuner it doesn't seem to be possible to catch any station without significant static or distortion. As an emergency radio, without any other options, it would probably suffice, but it will be just that, a device I use as a radio only as a last resort.I'll actually find the siren, the led flashlight, and the red led strobe to be the most useful of the items, as long as the dynamo and rechargeable battery pack continue to provide the juice.FYI, the manual states that 10-15 minutes of cranking may provide enough cell phone charge for one minute of talk time, depending on phone capability. That should do in an emergency, otherwise be ready to crank for a while to get some more bars on your battery."
30824,1,"I'm not using this product for its intended purpose, so I can't attest to ease of installation, but I can say that I'm pulling A LOT more current through it than you are supposed to, and I haven't managed to melt the solenoid. You are supposed to use 12-14V from your car, I'm using 30V. The setup should have a 3A fuse, which is not included, but not a big deal, but I'm using a 5A instead since the 3A ones kept popping. I am quite impressed with how this valve has endured in these conditions."
138722,0,The design and concept of the flare is great. When the product was received the packaging was excellent and assembly parts were all there. The front flares went on very nicely and everything fit well. It was a very quick installation. The experience with the rear flares was not as good. Both rear flares were approximately two-three inches to long on one end. This meant having to cut a slot in the flare so that it would fit tighter against the fender. It still left a wider gap and the flare protruding below the body metal. This was the end that had the curved rollunder so it would not have looked better to have just cut it off. It was supposed to fit the fender. This also made it necessary to drill new mounting holes.
8400,0,"I have just taked delivery, (11/12), of three Optima Blue Top batteries for deep cycle ""house"" service in an RV. The first battery to arrive was in a beefy cardboard box design for a heavy battery. The next two were in ""repurposed"" standard strength boxes with some foam padding and nylon straps around the box. The UPS driver waited while I opened the boxes since they were in bad shape. Luckily, there was no battery damage. I was not impressed with this shipping arrangement. Based on a sticker on the first battery, it was manufactured in July 2012. It had an open circuit voltage of 12.41 V. The other two batteries had manufacture dates of November 2012 and open circuit voltages of 12.71 V and 12.57 V. Optima literature states the open circuit, full charge voltage is 13.2 V. I am disappointed in getting a battery that had been sitting somewhere for 5 months and disappointed the ""fresh"" batteries were not closer to 13.2 V."

The write up for this says ""set of 2"" and to me that means a ""set of 2 pairs of gloves"". In fact I did get 2 gloves, one left and one right, that is one pair. I consider this to be a bit of deceptive advertising."

181244,2,"Don't ever use this stuff on nice new shoes and boots. You won't be able to polish them and getting this stuff off is very difficult if not impossible. It will give you dull, extremely dull, boots or shoes and will also darken even dark leather.It may be ok for work boots and equipment that you don't want to shine, but it really is not for use on fine leathers. Other water resistant coatings should be considered, or none at all, just polish, anything but mink oil."

148116,1,"I needed to replace the battery on my BMW R1150GS, the OEM battery from the dealer was over $200. This is a direct replacement and Yuasa are the OEM batteries for many motorcycles so I trusted the quality. I was lucky enough to purchase it for $65 so the savings alone outweighed any inconvenience of having to wait a few days for shipping.The battery does ship dry, meaning acid needs to be added. I made a trip to the local auto parts store and purchased a quart of battery acid for $3.99 it came with a pour spout so it was no mess adding the acid to the battery. Just take your time and fill each cell to the same height. You can also set the battery on a piece of cardboard on your garage floor just in case you do spill a little acid.Be responsible and take the old battery to recycling center to be disposed of properly, don't just throw it in the trash. The auto parts store where you purchase the acid may take the old one for you."

Apparently, I have to pay for their mistakes."
23979,1,"After doing some research for my 2005 350Z, I found a great deal on Amazon for EBC at the time so I went with EBC Red Stuff + EBC Sports Slotted Rotors (Both manufactured by EBC England). I was going to go with Hawk + Powerslot slotted rotors (Both made by Hawk or vice versa) originally.The EBC Redstuff brake pads have a break-in coating on it that is red. EBC recommends 500 miles of light braking to break them in properly. It took about 400 miles on my 350Z. You don't need to do the 30mph then stopping quickly like you do for Hawk+Powerslot combinations.After 4 weeks, the EBC brake pad + EBC Sports rotor combination are working great with practically no dust at all and great stopping power. They don't squeak or anything. I installed them myself and took the time to do it right by cleaning the rust off the inside off the brake equipment on the car with a wire brush, most shops don't do this and they are supposed to. Not cleaning out the rust off the axle/wheel/brake assembly on the car can cause an uneven seating of the rotors to the mounting area on the axle. This is why some people complain new brakes are worst and may even seem warped. If you take it to a shop, have them do it right!A couple things to notice, the break-in period is light breaking for 500 miles. Mine broke in at about 400 miles and they stop great. the paint on the outside of the brake pad was flaking off/chipped in places when I got them but I didn't care, they are there to stop my car and I heard the paint does bake off under track use and super high temperatures in performance driving so shouldn't matter to most daily drivers even with the occasional track days. The pads are more than enough for street performance. EBC makes the Greenstuff pads for SUVs/Light Trucks and the Yellowstuff pads for high performance use. The Redstuff is recommended for mid/heavy sports cars but would work great on light sports cars too.The EBC slotted rotors are slotted well and not too deeply into the rotors, where I've seen slots almost halfway through the plating, these were fairly shallow which helps with the strength of the rotors. Having deep slots weakens the rotors (if that is important to you).Dust? There is nearly no dust from this combination compared to the stock rotors and pads. My front wheels are cleaner and dust free practically. I've always had noise on my front brakes (not bad noise but noise of the pads brushing against the rotors) which were the same with the stock rotors and pads so I'm not concerned. Great product, great deal on Amazon and Amazon Warehouse at the time for open box items."

78036,1,"Here is an update to a 5 year old jump starter. This was my first and currently have 4 others but nothing as powerful as this. Last week the battery would not hold a charge and I really did not want to spend alot getting something comparable to this ""power house"".So after unscrewing alot of screws the unit comes apart and inside is a sealed , heavy duty,electric scooter type , 18 amp hr , lead acid battery.

107630,2,I actually ordered two for my 99 Honda Accord to try to get the engine light to go out. Car ran fine even before installing these sensors. It never did extinguish the light. I think it must be a Honda thing as I probably could have got the light to go out if I let the dealership install their OE sensor at 4 to 5 times what I paid for the generic version.
100830,0,"The quality is great and the brand is one that I have purchased before. The problem is that there are no options here to select year or model of vehicle.

It didn't fit mine, so I had to send it back."
169398,1,"A tennis ball on a string will perform the same function but this is much cooler!Set-up was very easy although the person who wrote the instructions clearly did not have a full understanding of the subtle nuance of the English language.The idea that the unit is solar powered (driven by the garage door opener lights) is simply brilliant. No batteries to replace, ever.Aiming the laser was tricky in my case as both cars in the garage are jet black and my idea of beaming the laser on the car was abandoned after discovering how difficult it was to see the laser light in the black finish.I settled for finding a spot to shine the laser (it creates a red line)on the garage wall and I would be able to drive the car forward until the line dissapeared from sight. That would then be the ideal stopping point. This worked well with only one problem I did not discover until nightime.Driving into the garage with the headlamps on washed out the laser marking and required that I turn off the headlamps before docking.With all this little issues, I still think this is very handy little product and I have had no problems with the way it works. Once aimed, a little loc-tight or nail polish on the screw for the laser head mount is probably a good idea as a slight movement of the beam after you have developed a strong trust in using the laser light as a guide could potentially result in thousands of dollars of repair to home and auto."
76308,2,"Beck Arnley 108-5140 Remanufactured Power Steering PumpThis pump is for my 1994 Jaguar Van Den Plas. This pump started leaking fluid the first day I drove the car after installing the pump.

There was no leaks on the power steering rack. I found fluid on the bottom of the pump. After I cleaned the fluid off the bottom of the pump and drove the car again, there was fresh fluid on the bottom of the pump. After I removed the pump to return it to the supplier, I noticed one of the bolts was never installed on the pump because there was paint in the bolt hole. I have requested a replacement.

174261,1,"I began using LP in 1996 when I started fighting forest fires in Northern Idaho. Funny enough, thats where and why it was invented. The store where I bought my fire boots (huge, bomb-proof logger boots) told me that this was what I should use.The boots took five years of every kind of abuse from submersion to heat to wood ash and LP kept them soft, waterproof and wearable. I tromped through fire and ash, planted trees in spring rains, crossed creeks and slogged through knee-deep mud and as long as I wasnt actually working in the creek all day, my feet stayed pretty dry--no blisters.I use it on my work and hunting boots now and, though it will darken lighter leather, there is nothing better. I have used mink oil (terrible), pure lanolin (not bad), sno-seal, pure bees wax (a close 2nd), and silicone (smelly) and this is the real deal. I also use it on leather gloves and baseball mitts; anything leather that needs moistened, softened or waterproofed.Don't expect anything to permanently waterproof boots. This will not give you the same protection of rubber boots and if they are cheaply made no grease or wax will keep water out of loose stiching.I don't usually melt it; the heat from your fingers applying it is usually good enough though once in a while I set them near the wood stove (3-4 feet away, no closer) to let it penetrate.Clean leather is better of course but even if you can't get them clean it can be applied to dirty leather with pretty good results.I will never use anything else."
113796,0,"I purchased this tested to test the fuel pressure on a 98 Dodge Neon. The manual is not up to date on the vehicle models it fits but it does fit my car. The unit is inexpensive, and performs as stated. The drain line is useful in bleeding the fuel system pressure, especially when you're done testing and want to remove the gauge.One thing I would have preferred is better knurling of the screw on coupling. Although there is some knurling, the coupling sleeve is still quite slippery and you can't get a liquid tight seal unless you tighten it down with a pair of pliers. The second thing is as other have mentioned, if they would supply a pouch to keep the drain line from spewing all over my drawer and getting tangled with other things.Overall, I am happy with it's performance. It's not a tool I use everyday and I'm happy to own one for this price. It helped me diagnose my fuel pump problem."

Even after following the troubleshooting instructions, and even calling B&D to double check the troubleshooting - it was exactly the same problem. I took them back to the store, exchanged them....same thing. Funny, when I went to a couple of automotive stores today to check out what other chargers were available, NONE of them carried this charger. I don't blame them.

144319,1,"I purchased this unit 4-5 years ago. I used it from time time to time when the power in my home went out by running extension cords in the house. I recently decided to install a transfer switch in the house and use the 240 volt. I own a small two story home, so didn't really need something to power the entire house. Little did I know this thing is a beast. I can run my heat pump, air handler, two refrigerators, one full size freezer and other miscellenous circuits in the house at the same time. We recently had a huge storm roll through the East Coast knocking out most power in my area. We we able to keep the house a cool 78 degress even when it was 100+ degress ouside.I know other people who own more powerful wattage generators that get kicked off-line with less amps and watts draw. The only complaint I have is it is very loud, but in my opinion it's not a deal breaker. It's also pretty heavy to move around, however I have it stationary, so it's not a big deal. If I had to purchase another generator, I'd go right back to a Porter Cable and buy it again."

I guess whoever does the shipping here got the message about poor/damaged packaging. Mine were both delivered undamaged by UPS(this is an extraordinary occasion), and to my surprise the boxes were designed like tanks.

I switched to this expecting better smoother and non rough shifing...i did not really work. It still is really hard if not worse in the mornings, but once it has been warmed up and driven for 10 min, it shifts great. personally i think because of its low operating temp. it causes it to warm up longer and become colder during cold start. If you are thinking about this for a daily driver and just wanting good quility and smooth shiftes, its great. But for fixing a rough shifting problem beacause of factory specs during cold start, forget it."

Fit onto the stock railings easily enough, was easy to install (Honda: pop off back seat with 10 mm bolt, open a panel of Phillips screws, open hose clamps), and is overall good. It's about the same sound level you would expect of a fuel pump, not overpowering but you can tell it's there when key is in On position before car's started.Having this product on my car makes me more likely to upgrade to performance parts in the future, knowing I have a proper fuel flow to maintain virtually anything that can be done to this car, without running lean. Great fuel pump, especially for the price. A stock replacement from a chain automotive shop is more expensive than this one."

97541,1,"This is one of the best products on the market period! The amount of extra light is insane. There's just enough of a blue tint at night, but not too much. It's not a white light but the color is fantastic and the installation could not have been easier"
168646,1,THIS BULB HAS VERY GOOD LIGHT OUTPUT ALMOST AS GOOD AS SYLVANIA SILVERSTARJUST THIS IS MUCH MORE CHEAPER.
49570,1,I got this for my mustang and pretty happy with it. It's not anything fancy but I am happy that it has the nylon straps with Velcro rather than the elastic. The elastic seems to degrade pretty quickly so I have hopes that this will last longer.
150584,2,Delivered quickly. Item does NOT scan as described on any DEI system (Avital/Clifford/Viper) - it just flashes 1 LED. Very disappointed. Too much work to return it. Lesson learned.
92689,1,"Had trouble getting the order (USPS)and had to contact Amazon which immediately sent me a replacement impact wrench. Overall it was a good transaction and I appreciate the customer service at Amazon.com. I will be dealing with Amazon in the near future. The impact wrench seems very good quality and can't wait to use it some more. Made in the USA, that's great. Philip Whitacre"

11346,0,"These nicer spark plugs are pretty much required in Saabs after 1999. So I just bought what I was told and the car is running fine.The way they were sent, the plugs were in small boxes somewhat loose inside a bigger box. The smaller boxes all opened and and all the spark plugs were loose when the package arrived. Luckily, I had just bought a gap tool and was able to see the factory gaps were not compromised."
26925,1,"i first tried to save a few dollars buying a competitors air filter; not a good idea! fitment was a problem; so i had to return the product and wait of course a couple weeks for co[bike bandit] to receive the filter/log it in/inspect it/and then send my purchase back to credit card/ [2] weeks! i purchased a k&n filter from AMAZON ;received it,installed it be-fore [bike bandit ever acknowledged receiving the other one! SO ; BUY A NAME BRAND PRODUCT [QUALITY!!!!!] from someone who ships their product immediately! MY MISTAKE SHOULD BE YOUR BLESSING!"

21632,2,"I purchased a pair of these ""perforated"" gloves because they look slick.Unfortunately, they ripped within two weeks of more than gentle use. The Velcro closure on my right hand has already begun to separate from its stitching, & no longer provides a snug fit around my hand. I emailed the Motorcycle Market on the 22nd regarding the poor quality of the gloves & still have not gotten a response.Essentially, I paid $60.80 for gloves that ripped in a week! -_-I imagined that $60 would last me a lot longer than 2 weeks; apparently I was wrong.I just want my MONEY BACK. - UPDATE: Got my money back as of May 15th ^_^"
119714,2,I assumed Timken was the best. Due to time issues I had a 5 Star Dodge dealer install my parts. This one fell apart on them after removing from packaging. There unit cost me a bundle to purchase OEM from Dodge. The mechanic also informed me that THERE PART was slightly more Heavy-duty? So now I am stuck with a paper weight.
45365,0,These units work and are very reasonably priced. They only have platese for the upper part of the ramp. I should have bought the more expensive unit that has plates for the bottom of the ramp.
165600,1,"The picture is deceiving, but the description DOES say 'camel' color. The cover is very light reddish brown. The whole top side is pieced sheepskin and the sides and backside are matching acrylic fuzz. Having raised sheep and used an entire REAL sheep pelt as a seat cover before (I skinned it myself), I know that it would take a whole pelt to cover a car seat. By being 'pieced' it enables the manufacturer to offer genuine sheepskin at a lower price. Twenty years ago it used to cost almost $100 to have one of our sheepskins just tanned--I can only imagine the cost now. This is quite nice for the price. If you want a SOLID sheepskin seat cover, you would undoubtedly need to pay in excess of $200. As far as installation goes, its like all seat covers--seats vary so from one model to another that you have to be a little creative on what to hook the straps to so it will stay stable. Mine worked out just fine on my 1996 Toyota Avalon."
153189,1,Fit my Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly AND fit easily into the back pocket of my passenger seat for storing. Make sure you know how to fold these kind of shades up before purchasing. Or be ready to try try again. I've worked with photography reflectors before so it wasn't a problem for me; but others who have tried folding them up for me have gotten frustrated and handed them back.
168138,0,"When I received this device I was not able to use it at first until I loaded some additional information into it. I would not be so disgusted with this fact had I received the right hook up to download the iformation into my brand new Dell computer. But the connector they sent to download was not compatible with any port on my computer, so I had to go to Staples in order to buy a $30 connector so that it would now plug into a USB port. Now I understand that technology keeps changing which is why you would or might have to dowload new information, but as long as I have using computers, USB ports have been the most available."

156686,0,"Bosch 4822 Evolution All-Season Bracketless Wiper Blade, 22I watched many ads on TV and read a lot of reviews, but I was disappointed with these wiper blades. Mostly because they tend to squeek and drag on the windshield in light rain. Not a lot, but more than I would expect from this supposed calibur and price blade. I don't know about others, but smooth running, quiet blades are priority 1 to me."
171566,1,This is a heavy duty cover and great quality. It does fit our 2007 Jeep Wrangler but is a tight fit.
109398,2,After returning 2 of these Accurtire gauges I give up. The first came apart at the gauge end and the second blew off the nozzle end. Both times parts were lost so I couldn't fix them. With the third gauge after tightning the ends. the analog reads right but the digital reads about 1/10 of the correct reading. So the choice is risk losing parts by not tightening or having inaccurate readings. Best choice is not buying.
145368,2,It DOES NOT FIT ON PASSAT CC 2.0 sport.they claimed that it fits but it is smaller than the original one !!!I was simply robbed.
75822,1,it is great. keeps your hands warm inthe winter without needing to use your gloves and no burnt hands in the summer.seems to keep its fluffiness.

71238,1,"Having a car charger has always been a necessity for me. I always seem to find myself running low on my cell phone batteries as I drive home. Often times I receive a call or make the occasional call while I drive, and, since the battery is low, I'd prefer not to lose the call. Having an iPhone, this ended up being the car charger I picked out.There really isn't too much to say. It gets the job done. Has a little LED to indicate power to the charger. I'm sure there are plenty of generic chargers out there that accept a USB connection, I'd prefer not to have to worry about dragging my sync cable around with me. This charger enables me to do that, since it's got the 30 pin connector the iPhone needs.Since I've never used the charger to fully charge my iPhone, I can't comment on the time it requires to fully charge the device, but it certainly has nearly charged the iPhone when connected for an hour or so. I assume this is due to the ""quick charge"" that newer devices now have.I don't think you'll be disappointed with this. Price isn't bad, and, it just works as you'd expect."
85029,1,"I knew I was taking a chance ordering this online because of numerous reviews regarding the poor packaging and the resulting damage because of it breaking through the box. I ordered from Amazon because I knew the return would be easy if I had to go through that. Evidently the manufacturer is undaunted by review after review of the unit just being shipped flopping around in a large box without any supporting structure to protect it. The receiver came from UPS with a huge hole in the side of the box and a lot of tape over it. It DID break through and looked like it was dropped. The paint was damaged and I had to touch it up, but he unit was otherwise intact.I had to use my floor jack to hold it in place and install it by myself. I used web instructions to make it easy. The included written instructions are pretty meager. It fit perfectly on my 2012 Tacoma. The bumper does need to be realigned before you tighten the bolts in the end as there is some slop for adjustment on the Tacoma. This is not noted in any instructions I came across.The receiver seems heavy duty and the fit and finish were excellent."

The only bad thing is that not enough carpet screws are provided and you end up with a small hole in one mat with no plug or screw to fill it.

8656,0,"First...these seat covers (I got two) look really good in real-life (always a little concern buying based on a picture). They went on easily and stayed in place reasonably well. However, I bought them for a smaller car with bucket seats and when I got in I found that the little flaps on the sides were pushed up so high that the only flat seat left was the blue strip in the middle. I'm not a fat man but I'm not a skinny teenage girl either (for whom these would no doubt be great) so I was pushed up a little and kind of had the feeling of sitting on a comode. I ended up putting them in a larger car which didn't eliminate the problem but did reduce it. Bottom line: Very soft and cozy and I liked the lumbar support but didn't work in a small car."
20757,1,"I had my side view mirror clipped off while i was at work and ordered this one the next day. I paid a total of $42 including shipping. It arrived a week later and i have to say, it is EXACTLY what i needed. I also called the dealership my father works for and WITH his discount they wanted $325 ($550 without) so for a savings of almost $300, i would definitely recommend this product/seller. the wait was absolutely worth it"
56722,0,"I bought two chargers - this one with 4 outputs to power my standby generator battery, my electric gate, and to charge my vehicle's D31 optima batteries for running my inverter.The other charger was a singe output, higher quality unit with much more power, and best of all it had a desulphating pulse mode which far exceeded this units ability to revive batteries.Each charger has its place. For the 4 batteries, I have a 4 unit charger in an outdoor enclosure ready to hook up (with exentsions)For portability and ""need it now"" charging I have the fast and the furious charger (see my reviews for it's advantages over this unit).At 1.25A charging current x 4 you are only getting 15V x 5A or 75W of output for over 180 dollars, which is not a good value, so I subtracted one star.The connectors lack the weatherseal and are leaching copper in the recent rains, so I subtracted another star for thatI am overall much happier with my single unit charger's performance since I can select .75A - 3.5A with it and have the batteries topped off and desulphated at the end of charge. This just sits at 13.2 VDC at the end of charge, which is good in its application because my gate needs some power to run the magnetic lock that secures the driveway.I needed 5 chargers, I got 5 chargers, and they each do their job. I wish the other company made a 4 unit charger at this price - I'd be buying it in a heartbeat."
77056,1,"I have an RV that is finicky about being left alone too long.If it hasn't been driven in a few days (ok a week or more) the battery is drained until some alarm goes off and drains it the rest of the way. After calling the tow truck about 12 times in the last couple years, someone brought this box to start the van. IT WORKED. I bought one myself so I no longer have this embarrassing problem. I see some folks have received defective products so I made sure mine worked. It does and I am very pleased."
177869,0,"As an air filter it works. I placed this in my 2010 Rav4 as I was looking for a little better performance when hauling a small trailer. I noticed that with this filter (on two tanks of gas) my city mpg went from 20-21 mpg down to 18-19 mpg. Placed the Toyota airfilter back in the vehicle and I am back to 20-21 mpg again. On the hwy I was getting 1 mpg less with this filter. I normally get 26-27 and with this I am getting 25. There is no difference in mileage when pulling my trailer from my past results. I also notice no difference at all in performance of the vehicle. For the price of this filter, even with it being a lifetime filter, I would expect at least the same performance as the stock Toyota filter."
48812,0,"I've used it a couple of times and it works so far. I've had a little trouble with getting a good connection to the tire stem, but once i get past that, the pump seems to work well on both 120V and 12V."
164081,1,"If you have this thing, you don't need all those car chargers for your cells, cameras, or whatever. I love it! It works good and looks good! Great thing to have if you are running around alot by the car."
72592,0,"I bought these to replace my axle bearings in my 98 Jimmy. I wanted the best in the industry so I went with timken. When I opened the timken boxes and looked at the bearings they said KOYO on them. I looked at the boxes again and said what the heck. Being in the business I knew there could only be two reasons for what I was seeing. Someone either swapped out the Koyo for the timken to save the money or Timken subbed out the work to Koyo. I e-mailed Timken and asked them what the deal was and this is what they said. ""Thanks for your letter of concern regarding what is in the box. Timken does not manufacturer all the product we sell. BUT we do have control of the quality and specs of the product we put in our box. It must conform to the same quality standards as the product we manufacturer. Which means a lot of potential suppliers are eliminated. We also will use whomever is OE for the part whenever it is possible."" So I guess that answers my question? If you want your bearings to say Timken then your going to have to engrave it yourself because these dont. I gave it three stars because I was really disappointed in Timken for this but at the same time if it passes their test then I guess its good stuff."
138353,2,i've been testing it for 1 week and this product is not bringing good results. it just doesn't work. it doesn't recharge anything. i think i'll return it if it keep not working!is very big!
184340,2,I bought this at a local Auto Zone. I went to tighten the smaller drain cap and it cracked. I exchanged it for another and that leaks oil despite the cap not breaking on this one. I left it in a garbage bag and it's half full of oil. How can stores and this company market and sell something like this that obviously does not work? Frustrating to say the least!
36375,1,The drums were exactly as expected minus the rubberized coating that helps deaden sound. I haven't seen any like that but on factory new so no big deal. I just kinda thought since they were Motorcraft that they might have the coating. Nonetheless they were new and braking is smooth and quiet again. I figure after my review someone at Amazon might redo the photo so it shows a rear drum instead of a 4 bolt rotor with caliper.
133589,1,"just a short review, but this stuff works great. my old, faded bumpers look brand new, which really makes the whole car look new."

157110,2,"This thing may not be the biggest piece of crap I've ever bought, but for the price it sure is. I bought one of these things a while back, used it IAW the instructions, and... Spots, streaks, smears... I had to wash the car again, the old fashioned way. I wound up giving this thing to Goodwill and actually felt guilty about it. My girlfriend gave me another the other day and it claimed to be improved, I figured what the heck and tried it again... Same results; washed the car a second time, the old fashioned way. For openers, the soap is too weak and they say you have to use their soap or it won't work; and the filter, well perhaps our Texas water is just too hard for that poor little thing. Listen, you want a spot free car? DON'T waste your money on this rip off; go buy a nice soft cotton towel, or better yet, a good chamois and do it the right way."
506,2,"I installed one of these on my 96 Ford Ranger , and a few days later noticed my left brake light wasn't coming on. After checking the light and wiring , I discoved there was no signal coming from the converter unit. So I went down to Auto Zone and picked up a second unit and installed it . The light worked like it was supposed to ... for a few minutes , the quit again . I felt the converter box and it was warm to the touch. I removed it and took it back . I then ordered a third unit from Draw-Tite off of Amazon . I installed it and everything is working fine . I put a stick on the brake pedal and left it on for some time just to be sure . So far so good. I did notice that the Hopkins unit grounds to the frame with a self tap screw , and the Draw-Tite unit grounds back through the factory harness ."
35848,1,"Fast delivery, could of been in better condition for the price I paid for it, wish it would of came programmed. Didnt get it programmed yet which will cost me 60.00, so i dont know if it works yet but will be back to let you know"
165555,1,The good news is that this is easy to spray on and wipe off. The spray handle gives a fine mist that covers a good area. The spray wipes off easily. The bad news is that the shine is not much better than if I had just washed it and left it. Maybe it will get better over time as the coating builds up. It also streaks a bit but this is minimized if you use a good microfiber cloth. It's good stuff but doesn't give me the kind of shine I would get from a regular wax job.
133569,1,"I own a Black 1999 Honda Prelude Base, which came from the factory with only gray trim. I bought this product to try and dye my trim black, even though it wasn't black to begin with. It has worked amazingly! I can't believe how much better my car looks now! I did two coats on both sides and back trim of my car, and the the bottle is still 3/4 full! Awesome! This product has worked great, and i will try to remember leave a comment in a few months to see how it has held up. Btw, there are pictures of my car in the customer photos above, so take a look at them to truly see how great of a product this is!"
145907,2,"Box said ""Made in Canada"", bearing in pulley says ""China.""While similar, the one I received is not a direct replacement for the pulley on a Jeep Grand Cherokee 2000 4.0L. It is the same width and inside and outsider diameter but the profile of the pulley is not the same as the original. This means that the large washer that would normally cover the bearing does not fit (the diameter is now too large.) The manufacturer (or should I say 'assembler') provides a small top hat shaped bushing that fits in the bearing - however, that does not work with the existing fixture for the pulley (it protrudes too far into the bearing.)I have now bought just the a bearing from Amazon, of a known make and quality,6203-2NSE Nachi Bearing 17x40x12 Sealed C3 Japan Ball Bearingsand have replaced the worn out bearing in the original pulley by using aNeiko Tools USA Bearing Race and Seal Driver Set.If you don't already have one - aOEM 27115 Serpentine Belt Toolmakes removing and replacing the serpentine belt a breeze."
110355,0,"I thought I was getting a good deal until I covered my fifth wheel camper. The problem is that the company should have made the roof that covers the roof wider. It barely covered my roof. I added extra rope to secure, did not help. First good wind & now 1/2 the roof is covered. Tried to adjust it & the cover ripped. Now what?"
166471,1,"It does exactly what it's supposed to do, but the setup is a bit confusing. After several false starts, got it working perfectly."
183673,0,"Having tried this on a car at room temp. in summer(85 degrees) the wax is nothing special, though I'm no pro. Would not get this again. Fun to try out."
167479,1,"Great cover, great price. A bit thicker than some of the others I've seen which does mean it will take up more room on the road. Only complaint is the hooks. While I am usually a big fan of metal versus plastic, in this case im not. No matter how careful I am the 2 hooks used to secure the cover will knock against the bike when in installing or removing the cover. They are super easy to remove though. Overall a great product."
97530,0,"The bad...the first set I bought did not fit as the plug was at a 90 angle (the # the book said), I needed the straight one. Also, they don't last long. Mine lasted about a year and others have pointed out 8 months. The good...they are much brighter than standard yellow looking bulbs and cover a lot more of the road. Are they worth the ongoing replacement cost??"
14460,0,"The antenna looks good and works very well, however the threaded stud that attaches the antenna to the sheet metal is too short.The threaded stud is long enough if the antenna is mounted on a completly flat surface. There are hardly any flat surfaces on a modern dayautomobile. I had to discard the grommett and use a silicon sealer to make it work.This is fault of engineer at factory. The threaded stud needs to be at least 1/8 inch longer - 1/4 inch would be better. The antenna appears to be well made, but time will tell."

6242,1,"Rotors are motorcraft branded, have the ABS tone ring, come with pressed in inner and outer races. Price for two was less than a set of brake pads! Heavy items but shipped extra cost with Prime. Machining was good - rotor surfaces flat, clean, and had oilpaper backing inside the plastic sack. Measured true and correct dimension for application. No corrosion present when unwrapped.The only con is the item is made in China.... like everything else. At this price point I wasn't going to argue. Super buy. It was cheaper to replace the hub/rotor than have the old ones (with 180K miles on them) turned."
70792,0,I received the snowbroom in very good condition and in a timely matter.The only problem was I ordered 2 and only got one. But I was given a refund for the second one. I haven't used it yet. But I like the fact that it has an extendable handle so it is going to be much easier to reach the middle of the roof and windows. I do think that the bristles could of been a bit stronger. All in all this as a great snowbroom. I hope that I get to use it soon and that it works well. SJR
38174,0,"This patina works reasonably well if the surface is extremely clean, however I have not been able to achieve the jet black patina one expects with tin/lead, and the finish is very difficult to apply evenly. It is essential to let the surface air-dry before buffing. On the good side; when this product is mixed with a very small amount of black patina solution, the resulting patina is quite beautiful. The result is a very dark, almost black patina with bronze highlights (obviously precipitated copper). It does not have the bright copper character associated with a pure copper patina (CuSO4 soln'), which I find objectionable for most projects. The result was perfect for some windows mounted in dark red/brown wood. So, as far as I'm concerned, this product is no substitute for tinning all the zinc surfaces in my work - but at least I have a use for what I bought!Good seller, product was well packaged to avoid leaks during transport.Update 01-30-13:I know of at least one person who got excellent results with this patina on zinc. The key is to make sure that the surface is absolutely, completely clean."
106156,2,"I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in, but not without considerable effort. Now that it's in the bike, I am a bit worried about it sealing properly. If I had it to do again, I would go with a different hi-flo aftermarket filter, or the OEM."

26207,1,"I purchased this controller to install in a 06 Pontiac Montana that we use for towing a pop-up tent trailer.I wired it up myself, and was able to easily install the controller. I had to contact the manufacturer to find out which wire to connect to for the brake signal. I received an e-mail response in less than 8 hours, detailing exactly which wire, where to locate it, and the color. Their response was fast, accurate & helpful.The controller is a basic model, using a time delay to determine braking power. It works as described by the manufacturer.I took the trailer for a test drive and was able to quickly dial in the amount of braking power desired.Unfortunately, 1 week after installing the brake controller the vehicle was involved in an accident and declared a total loss. I'll likely be purchasing another one of these in the coming weeks."

132475,2,"While the concept is a wonderful idea, unless the average consumer is an electronic wizard and can install themselves, finding anyone to install it is next to impossible. Most auto repair facilities will not install it and stereo installation facilities will charge an average of $60 per hour with 4-6 hours estimated. Contact with the manufacturer was of no help. Installation in manual shift cars is prohibited. Installation in automobiles with computer systems has caused many problems. Additionally, fires have been reported. At the present time, I am waiting for Return Autorization from Amazon for the two that were purchased."
100031,1,"Engine: 3.4L in a 2004 Chevy Impala (transverse v6)A week ago I attempted to replace the wires and plugs without a puller. I managed to get 4/6 done, but ultimately had to throw the towel in on #3 and #5 (on the back side toward the firewall). My arms were bruised to hell and back, and my hands were totally spent. I wrestled with the car for hours to do 4/6.Anyway, I searched for a puller and bought this one from Amazon. I went back out today armed with this puller, and the last 2 wires came off so easily that I kicked myself for not getting this in the first place. This puller works by getting behind the boot all the way down at the end where the plug is located (it gets in there behind the lip of the boot). All it took was a firm pull and the wire was off. Even though it's a ""braille job"" doing those back ones, this was so much easier than fighting with the car for hours just to remove some plug wires.If you are working on a GM transverse v6 engine like mine, this tool will save you a lot of time and bodily damage. I highly recommend it!!!"
32225,1,Replaced the failing O2 sensor on my wife's '03 4WD Tahoe with the 5.3. It fit perfectly. The computer stopped complaining about the failing sensor and everything works great.Replacing the sensor on this vehicle is tough unless you have small arms. It was very difficult to reach the electrical connector with one hand. I finally had to detach it from its mount and pull it down where I could get two hands on it.

62136,0,"Doesn't work as well as i would have hoped. You really need the surface before to be black as well. I ended up buying a plastic krylon spray paint, masking the entire car, and doing all my trim with the paint instead.The paint provides a much darker, much more professional look (that will NEVER fade), and doesn't streak. I did however use this on my tires\window gaskets and weather stripping with some success.Bottom line, if you want to re-do your trim, do it properly, rather than spending the cash on a product that lets you cut corners."

112580,1,"Installed on my Dodge 402A DOHC engine in my MG Midget. Woke up the ignition. Increased plug gaps and get bigger fatter spark, more complete combustion, better mileage and more power all at the same time."

11059,0,"These mats fit pretty well. they are more expensive than generic mat sold at Target, but these may fit better. However some of the Universal Mats from Target look more deluxe. these mats look nice but seem a little basic and thin. also the back seat floor mats are shorter than the stock mats. the stock mats go quite a bit further under the front seats.I wish I had tried the universal mats from Target first and see how they fit. oh, well, no that I have 'em we'll see how they hold up.We have the pearl white TL with the light tan interior. the stock carpets are light tan too and get dirty too easy. there is some black on the upper door panel and dash, so these black floor mats work as it continues the two tone look to the floor."
76557,2,"Bought the Dorman pump thinking the quality was good but I was wrong. I received the pump and tested it before installing it; the pump was extremely noisy so I exchanged it. I received the second pump and this one is noisy too but not as much as the first one, so I decided to give it a chance and installed it. It works fine but it is noisy, now I have a noisy car.If you can afford to buy a good quality pump then don't bother with this one, you will not be happy. lots of room for improvement or the price shall be reduced significantly. I don't recommend the Dorman pump."
177510,2,"The visor itself seems reasonably well made, and optically seems very clear, with a firm notch that catches the visor into its lowest position. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually fit my new 3/4 helmet (BBH) very well. It portrudes from the front of the helmet such that it seems very awkward; the snaps don't quite line up, and since they are not adjustable, that's a problem; and it's angled upward so as to catch the breeze, due to the not quite precise fitment. At the low price, I rolled the dice, and it didn't work-- I'll hold onto it, and hope another helmet I pick up in the next year or two will fit it... or that a friend can use it.On the extremely positive side, Jafrum delivered the product very quickly (ordered on a Wednesday with expedited 1-3 day shipping, and arrived Friday morning.) Great service, once again.Side note... can't help but wonder if they sent me the wrong one, as the advertised product is supposed to have adjustable snaps... the one I received, did not."
130469,2,Give me a break -- WAAAAAAY too expensive... and never on sale anywhere...and hard to put together and get on your car without scratching it up.
104184,0,"Bought this for a 1982 Yamaha 650 Seca. Fits properly, but wish it came pre-oiled like other K&N filters. The informational sheet says to use 3/4 of the oil packet, but following K&N's directions to oil every crease, I easily used the entire tube."

50102,0,"THE PRODUCT CAME, BUT NOT IN THE CASE, IT CAME ON THOSE HARD PLASTIC PACKAGES. SO, WHERE IS THE CASE ?"
57451,0,"Okay, let's look at the product description:* Black, weather-resistant powder coat finishThe powder coat finish looks good coming out of the box. However it was soon apparent that it's *just* weather resistant, not scratch resistant. By the time I'd assembled the basket on our driveway that much was clear.* Fixed shank provides for extra ground clearanceOkay.* Total weight of cargo and carrier should not exceed 500 poundsWe used this last weekend on the back of our CR-C to haul a bunch of camping gear up to the Sierras. I used two Rubbermaid storage boxes packed with gear and it fit with room to spare.Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24-Gallon* Easy to installYeah, it wasn't bad. I recommend assembling the basket on a lawn though to help preserve the painted finish. Mounting it to the vehicle was easy, only made slightly more difficult by doing it solo and using this hitch pin:Softride 25219 QuietRide Hitch PinSee my review on that item to see what the pain was.* Formed 2 inch square extension bar is reversible to be used in drop or rise positionI used this on our CR-V in the drop position, which was the only way the rear door would open. Ground clearance was a lot less in that position; we scraped the road a couple of times going in/out of driveways during fuel stops. (Only when my wife was driving...I would never do such a thing!) lolOne *IMPORTANT* note:Last year we rented a cargo basket for our camp trip. It worked great, which prompted this purchase. The main difference between the rental basket and this one is the outer rail; this one is just a round bar, where the rental had a 8"" solid metal lip all the way around.It wasn't until we finished the 3-hour drive that I appreciated the difference. The open space of this basket's design allowed the hot exhaust to spew directly into the load...which melted a 6 inch hole into the Rubbermaid container directly behind the exhaust pipe. (By ""directly"" I mean 12-14 inches) We lost a ground tarp and two flashlights, all melted from the heat...and almost had fiery excitement along the highway since there were also two bottles of lantern fuel in that box! When I pulled them out they were hot to hold; a close call for sure - had they been packed on the other side of the box things could have gotten ugly. Maybe I should have noticed this, but between the rush of packing and the memory of the last cargo basket working so well it slipped by me. In any case, if you use this basket be aware of the location of your exhaust pipe versus the load."
66911,1,Installed a pair of these on a 1991 Dodge Ram D250 in 30 mins. They are very stiff and the trick I used was to jack up the bed with a floor jack. After that I used a bottle jack on the axle to further raised the bed. When all was said and done the bed was raised almost 3 inches more than before. The ride is great and no more locking up the rear brakes.
113665,0,"This is a good product, however do not trust the picture, the lines connecting the pins to the car frame do not come wit hthis package. In other words, their default product picture is false advertising."
128653,0,"After having reviewed the dozens of racks available on Amazon, I decided to go with this one. It did not fit my truck as well as I felt it should have, especially after being told by the site that it would. There are a few things about the rack that are not clearly explained in the instructions. Knowing what I know now, I'm not entirely certain I'd go this way again.You may find it helpful to know that the rack will not stabilize one or two or three or four bikes in the bed of the truck by itself. You will need to provide additional stabilization for the bike or bikes toward the back of each bike. Bungee cords help, but of course, they did not come with the rack.Considering the fact that I did not have to drill holes in the truck bed to mount this and that it is removable, I'll continue to use this rack, but it's not the easiest thing in the world to deal with and my thinking is still, there must be a better way."
126568,1,"Nothing special to say. It works fine with my Nikon En-El3e (for D-200 & D-300& other cameras) batteries. I keep it in the truck at all times. Just plug it into the lighter, or wall jack and use it. It is not superfast or anything, just normal. It always works, even though I keep it in the truck, hot or cold weather. It's perfect for those times when you forgot to bring an extra battery and the juice runs low. Go eat dinner, and by the time you're done, you'll have an extra bar or two waiting for you to use. It also works fine for your overnight charger. A full recharge requires the full amount of time. Never done one in the truck, but it works just like a regular charger in the house.I've experienced NO problems. No exploding batteries, hot batteries, or run down car batteries. Every photographer should have one in his vehicle and travel bag. I have not used it overseas, but I wouldn't forsee a problem."
175448,1,"Just traded my Nissan Armada for a Toyota Prius. I love the Prius, but the horns it came with were very disappointing. After doing a little online research I found these horns. This kit actually contains two horns: one 500Hz and the other 600Hz.There are two versions of these horns: a lower pitched one that sounds like a typical American car horn (400Hz horn + 500Hz horn), and these horns which are slightly higher pitched and sound like a European sports car (500Hz horn + 600Hz horn). I found sound recordings of both horns online and decided that the sound of these horns would more fit the Prius. If you want a more traditional sound, go with the lower pitched horns.Installation was very easy. I was able to install in the stock horn locations; no relays required. I ran the grounds to the mounting bolts. I now have no problem being heard on the freeway."
67149,0,it works well but it does not have as good of a seal as the oem filter
72916,0,"Opted for the Optilux versus the Hella Micro DE for the price advantage alone. It will be installed to an older vehicle, so hopefully it'll serve it's purpose until I get a new car.Installation is straight forward once you find the best locations for the lamps, relay switch, toggle switch and ground.The light output is so-so. It emits a yellow beam that has a sharp cutoff. Combined with my HID low beams, I just don't see the difference (clear night). I notice that it lights up the road directly in front of my car, but my hood is in the way to enjoy this added illumination. Maybe when the fog rolls in I can truly take advantage of this.I've read other reviews/forums of applying silicone sealant to the gaps and lenses to help against water intrusion. That should help it last longer.The toggle switch should be switched out for a flip switch versus a push button one. (was it supposed to light up when on? because mine doesn't). Sometimes it doesn't completely turn on/off until I've tried several times to engage/disengage the button. If you have factory buttons, this should not be a problem.EDIT: I went to Radio Shack and bought a flip switch that illuminates when on.I don't know where to attach the ground for the switch inside the cabin. the connection loop is too small to add to existing bolts and the wire is too short to reach further locations. If you have suggestions, please comment. At the moment, it's not connected, but still works to turn the system on/off.EDIT: Bought larger wire connectors at Radio Shack to connect to a ground close to the switch location.For about $35 it's not a big financial burden, so I too will say the phrase: ""you get what you pay for"""
74703,1,"I had bought a multimeter from WalMart for use with my PC repair services, but the thing was somewhat hideous. I compared this to some other volt/ohm meters online, and this appeared to be a good deal. While the multimeter itself is reasonably priced, however, the shipping and tax applied upon purchase brought it up to about the same price as other select models.All in all, it works fine, is FAIRLY compact, and if aesthetics matter, is more attractive than some other ones out there. On the whole, I'm happy with the purchase, and I have no qualms (yet) with the product!"
1935,2,"I've had this gas cap for less than 6 months. During a road trip, I had let the gas level get much lower than usual (running on fumes) and when I stopped, this gas cap would not open. The clicking mechanism spun in both directions so that it could not be removed. We were at a gas station on the highway, so I was looking at a long expensive tow to a garage. I was able to force it open finally, using pliers and all the strength in my fingers. I put the OEM cap back on as soon as I got home.In addition, even before it failed, it sealed too tightly. My wife was often unable to open it without the use of a gas cap opener tool that we had to buy for an additional $20 to keep her from getting stranded. The two problems are probably related - either bad design or shoddy materials.This cap was a complete waste of money. I bought this cap to remedy the check engine light issue that supposedly results from a gas cap that has lost its seal, but the solution created a new, more serious problem. At least the other one opened every time. Unfortunately, it seems that Stant is the only game in town for after-market gas caps anymore, so I guess it's back to the dealer for a high-dollar cap that I can remove whenever I want.I'm just glad my wife wasn't alone when this happened."
41261,0,"I backed my minivan into my gate post and ended up with a large dent (about a foot long) on the side of the van. At first the dent puller gripped well and pulled the dent out a little (after putting a lot of muscle into it) on either side of the puller. The dent shrunk to maybe a handswidth, but once the dent was smaller than the dent puller, the dent puller could no longer get a grip on it to pull it out. I'm not sure if this was because the dent puller couldn't pull out anything smaller than its own circumference, or if it was the odd placement of the remaining dent on the vehicle. This product made my dent a little smaller, but the dent will still need to be professionally repaired. That said, it's been months and we still haven't repaired the dent, so maybe the reduction in size of the dent made us more comfortable with delaying professional repair."
176817,1,3M Plastic & Emblem Adhesive is amazing. First time I have used it and the loose plastic body trim is now firmly attached. A great product and worth the price.
32148,1,The wiring length on this unit is only 12 inches. Would not fit my 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 which requires 18 inch wiring length. Note the length when ordering as the website states it will fit and does not state wire length. You might want to measure yours before ordering. I must say also that Amazon is great for return this hassle free.
174668,0,"...it stopped working after the first couple of times I used it. Used it to extract coolant...worked great. Cleaned up and put away. Used it next to evacuate transmission fluid. Worked great, cleaned up, put away. Time for oil change rolled around get it out...nothing. No blocked lines, diaphragm hisses as should, no suction. Very disappointed that a nearly $100 item only worked a couple of times. Unlikely I will buy again."
158593,2,"This is a very poor quality product. It snapped in two when I began to stretch it around my 15.5"" steering wheel. I am a very dissatisfied customer. Also not pleased that the shipping cost was greater than the cost of the product (I suppose that should have been a red flag!)"

90230,0,"If you want a blade refill that will fit your blade, this might be the one. It can be adapted to fit a number of different OE blades.I was disappointed because I expected it to be the equivalent of what I was replacing, which had twin metal rails. This one has a plastic universal spine. To me, ""OE refill"" implies that it is the refill that came as OE equipment, not a different style that happens to fit. Whenever I got refills in the past, they matched the type that was in the original blade.I ended up returning this and getting a competing brand that truly was an exact replacement. It was a much better fit. If you use a refill that was like the original, you can expect it to sit the same and performance should be closer.The refill, not the pictured blade, is what you get when you buy this. If you have the blade pictured, perhaps this is the ideal refill."
66134,0,"The thing looks fine and everything, but it is supposed to convert the trailer socket. So why does it have a 4-pin flat vehicle connector?I already have one of those, coming from my vehicle. So therefore, they won't plug into each other (like a Male-male plug).Look at the diagrams on this page if you don't know what I'm talking about:[..]So I'm kind of wondering how all the other 5 star reviewers here figured that out. This thing is a 4 - pin flat vehicle connector. It should be a trailer connector. What gives?"
29592,0,"Arrived with no instructions, just rolled up in a box with two pieces of stick on velcro attached to one end of it. Did not really fit my 2006 Jeep Liberty.

I am not sure if I will be able to make it fit, or if I should send it back."
166989,0,kinda short had to modify but fits even though i didnt pass although i dont thinks its the sensor. all in all its good
172732,2,I bought this latch for my brothers 2000 dodge pick up it said it was supposed to fit but it wasn't long enough it hardly holds it together and if you try to open the window from the outside after 2 try's at opening it it will open and you can break In to the vehicle
113947,1,I recieved to product faster than expected. Great product exactly what I ordered. I would definitely order from this company again.

Bye bye Rain-X."
40024,2,I bought these lights for my skidloader as I do alot of work near or on the highway with snow removal.

I would not order them again if I had looked at the size.

186334,2,"The seat fit the bike fine. Looked great. However it was a pain in my back side. The back rest created by the passenger seat dug into my kidneys. The seat dug into my butt. I felt two support bars that just tore me up. I am a big guy at 6'2"" and 290lbs. The seat moved my riding position about an inch forward. With the passenger seat on, I couldn't sit fully in the solo seat without leaning forward. I tried all adjustments I could. I purchased all stock bracketing to mount it, pulled my bags off, no improvement. My wife loved the passenger seat, she could ride for hours with no problems. I could not. After about 30 minutes, it was almost unbearable. I put 300+ miles on the seat and then rode it to work a week later. 17 minute ride caused back problems all day. I sent the seat back and will look to an ultimate seat or some other brand later."

Very disappointing."

181624,0,"Last year I purchased a Toyota Prius. After I used all of the free oil changes, I looked for something that would improve the gas mileage of the the little gas engine, especially in cold weather. Unfortunately, my mileage dropped after I started using this oil. I then switched to Mobile 1 and mileage improved. Perhaps the the fact that Royal Purple does not sell a 0-20 or 0-30 oil other than its expensive racing line is part of the problem since winters in the high country of Colorado are very cold. Whatever the reason, this oil seemed to make the little Prius engine work harder."
118316,0,"i bought this product in hopes of saving some money and trying something new. Product came on time and in great shape. soon after i tried this product i was sadly disappointed, this product doesn't live up to its name and is kinda messy when applying. i wouldn't buy this product again, but hey who knows you may have better luck than i did."

114241,1,I have been using royal purple for about twelve thousand miles now. I used castrol R4T prior and had a noisy transmission when i shifted gears. Switched to Royal Purple no more noice. I will probably use this the rest of the time i have this bike. Yes i recommend it to my friends.

149258,2,"I am loathe to write a bad review for anyone or anything: but this gel seat cushion, for the money, was worthless.It is SO firm that it didn't seem to displace any weight; rather, it was just a nuisance under the bottom. And don't bother buying it if you have a... um... larger backside because you won't fit on it anyway.I gave it 2 stars because (a) it got here fast; and (b) it was, in fact, a gel-filled seat cushion. And it might actually WORK for someone out there... just not us.For the money, go buy a couple of stadium seat cushions and sit on them. They will probably do more for you than this thing will. Oh well, we tried."

184957,2,"These are great looking plugs and I was pleased with the price the only problem was that with the 13/16"" hex body they barely would go down into my cylinder head and then there was no way I could tighten them because I couldn't get any kind of wrench in the head to tighten them! Every web sight I checked said that they would fit my 1991 Mazda B2200 2.2L/FI truck but so far I've found no way to get them in. The spark plugs I currently have are 5/8"" hex body and they are very easy to put in or take out. If there is a special wrench to tighten them and take them out I would like to know because I like the plugs if I could get them in."
42830,1,This is a versatile vinyl cleaner. I have used it on my vehicle as well as around the house.The product cleans dirty and stained vinyl and leaves a slight shine behind.I used the product to clean my vinyl trim before applying Meguiars Ultimate Protectant. Various auto detailing boards stated that Ultimate Protectant would only last for 2-3 weeks but 5 weeks later my vinyl still looks a good as initial application. I attribute this to the Cleaner.The smell is hardly noticable which is good b/c many cleaners smell like harsh chemicals.You can't go wrong with this product from Meguiar's.
152477,1,Fit was as it should be. I really enjoy having these installed in this summer heat. Just like today had an unexpected shower and did not have to run out and roll up windows. Nor do I have to leave them all the way up in the heat.
136732,2,"I'd give it zero stars if I could.This is completely worthless. There are problems besides the key issue.All you have to do is pull hard and the lock comes apart and you are holding the two pieces in your hands wondering why you ever spent your money on garbage.

151948,1,i installed this unit on my 2004 Tahoe. It was a little harder to install than anticipated. Took 3-4 beers. Had to cut a good chunk out of my fan shroud. Looks sweet though and definitely gave me some good power.

133766,1,I bought these thinking they wouldn't be much good. WHen i received them (very quickly) i installed them to see how they would work out. THey amazed me. They have superior lighting and look amazing with the Chrome. THese are wonderful lights that i would recommend to anyone.
23834,1,"I have used these for years on motorcycles and cars. At work these get used on floor sweepers, generators, hydraulic pumps, anything that has a battery that needs to work but may sit for a long time. Unlike most charger/maintainers, this has a de-sulfate mode that can bring back abused batteries. Sometimes you need a dedicated charger to get them going and then this to condition them. Unless you have plenty of time to spare, in which case this will eventually bring back a worn down battery. Has the common two prong connector, alligator clips to go directly to battery terminals and enough cord length to be useful. The only gripe I have is the serial number on the registration card is the same for all of them. There is a statement that I can get an LED display with registering the unit. I have done this and eventually received a display unit about 2 months later. Then I found them for $4 at Harbor Freight. For the money, these maintain your batteries and work well. They will take up space on an outlet strip though."

I have no idea whether or not this feeble little box is doing anything at all. Perhaps I have one that is defective from the factory but I have no confidence now that a non-defective replacement is worth the money -- spend a little more for a ""real"" jumpstarter. This Black & Decker will just ""boost"" your wallet."

A step in the right direction, but ultimately doesn't solve my problem. I just need a 400ft extension cable for a traditional trickle charger (street parking FTL).Also, battery clips broke after the first week of usage. I sourced aftermarket alligator clips to replace them."
22736,1,Was replacing the spider injector assembly on my K1500 and needed the Plenum Gasket Set. Fel-Pro is a well known company that makes gaskets and I've never had an issue with any of their products.
53613,1,"This unit is the perfect size for my motorcycle. I installed the terminal leads to the battery permanantly, and ran the plug outside the side cover. What an ideal setup...no more messing around removing the cover and hassling with where to put a large charging unit, and this unit keeps the battery in top condition for instant use no matter the weather."
156058,1,Good price and shipping. Not much to say it is made well and works. We keep the truck inside so don't no if it would rust up fast.
169466,0,"Installation was very easy, just peel and stick. I could definitely see an improvement in bass, sound quality, and I also noticed that the rattles around the speakers have disappeared. Unfortunately there was still a lot of rattling throughout the door, and distortion seemed to be there on high volumes still on my Alpine speakers.Overall, this was a decent buy. It may be difficult to install for those who have no idea how to take out the door panel. The price is quite nice though, for those who are iffy on the whole Dynamat scheme."
18570,1,"It's an oil filter. A good one! I worked for VW many years ago, and Bosch stuff is world-class quality.Change you oil every 3,000 miles - use a good filter like this one, and you'll keep your car forever!"
124760,0,"Installation is a not as easy as just replacing your old horn. Because it uses more power, to avoid blowing fuses, have to use included relay. Mounting bolt that comes with it is not very good solution to hold it in place. Vibration loosens it up over time. Wiring and relay got to be hidden from elements and out of sight. That was one of the most challenging things for me and I ended up making custom electrical box to hide the relay.After all the trouble, I was really disappointed with performance. Used it few times and took it off.Not worth the trouble in my opinion."
51977,0,"I only give this product a 3 based on manufacturer claims of fitment. The hitch its-self and supplied parts, quality. Good pieces, no issues there. I've purchased others from Hidden Hitch and this one was no different, no issues.The only problems are fitment. Manu claims direct fit bolt on application for 96-04 Nissan Pathfinders. This is partially untrue. On a 2002 Pathfinder LE it will fit eventually but not without some modifications, albeit minor ones at that. The first issue is with the supplied bolts. Two of them are actually too long to fit in the rear most mounting holes. There just isn't enough space to slide the bolt around body components and get it to line up with the bolt hole and go in straight. Easily remedied by reusing the factory bolts from the Tow Points that had to be removed in an earlier mounting step.The second and only other fitment problem shows when attempting to line up all the bolt holes. The hitch will hit two metal tabs where the rear bumper cover bolts too. Again, not a big problem but if you aren't expecting it this can cause havoc. A few minutes of grinding, testing, and more grinding clearances the metal and the hitch will fully line up and away you go bolting it up.Overall, good product. If it fit with no necessary mod's or if the instructions at-least detailed that modifications were necessary it would get a 5."
19804,2,I returned this emergency keychain to Amazon because it didn't work.The spike wouldn't even dent a glass bottle. The razor blade that's supposed to cut seat belts in an emergency took too much time.

122823,1,Shipment was speedy. My wiper blades arrived sooner than I expected.. AWESOME! And now I can see in the rain!! I highly recommend Bosch Wiper Blades over any other brand!!!
108132,2,"I bought one of these thinking to spare my housemates, but immediately noticed it had several deficiencies.As originally designed, the unit is meant to draw smoke through the filter located inside the lid and expel the filtered air via vents in the base. However, in practice the design includes numerous leaks at the back of the tray, around the hinge of the lid. There's some foam rubber inside the base that's supposed to seal the leaks, but it doesn't work. I suspect that many of the people who have praised this unit's effectiveness were in fact seeing smoke being drawn directly into the fan compartment through the leaks, bypassing the filter entirely.The unit's effectiveness is also limited by the use of a cheap 3-volt motor that spins a noisy and inefficient impeller. Additionally, many users have reported problems with the spring-metal contacts that serve as an on-off switch: they're exposed to smoke and quickly get fouled.The good news is that I specialize in kludges. I cut a hole in the lid and installed a 12-volt computer-cooling fan directly behind the filter, after blocking the intended air channel with a bit of acrylic plastic and epoxy. I ran the leads for the fan through a hole in the base, installed a simple on-off slide switch, and powered the thing with an old 120VAC/12VDC adapter that once belonged to something else. The result is a smokeless ashtray that makes little noise, doesn't eat batteries, and actually works. Okay, the exposed fan on the lid makes it look like Doc Brown built it on his day off, but I like that."
71578,1,"Fitting is like described, just a 90 degree -10AN male to -10AN male bulkhead fitting. But lock nut is not included cause I didnt get one even tho it says it comes with it. Its wasnt there and I got 2 sets of these fittings, so best to check if you have to add lock nut and nylon washer before you check out."
40628,0,it works well but it does not have as good of a seal as the oem filter
6295,1,I had a new 05 F-150 that had terrible plusing on the OE brake rotor setup. Ford replaced the rotors at 6k miles and less than 1.5k miles they were as bad as ever. Awful! I did the research and decided to try these pads. I did a hard sanding of the rotors on the truck and installed these pads. Awesome!! No more plusing after 25k miles. They don't have the bite of the OE pads when cold so be warned. Do yourself a favor never buy any other brake pad. And no dusting makes them unbeatable.
22414,0,"They fit the seat okay, the order also came with some arm rest covers but my Titan does not have armrests? There is no cover for the center box as shown in the picture but it is not listed in the description either so whatever custom..."
103606,1,"These brake pads are the best, never heard a noise out of yet. I have used for 5months now. Remember to use brake cleaner fluid to clean out the rotor and the caliper before installing the brake pads. Also it's important to put the grease on at the edges of the break pads."
57053,2,"The door to the storage compartment falls off due to design, the gauge is not accurate, and it takes FOREVER to inflate a tire. I have been using it for inflating bicycle tires and air mattresses so far. The first time I tried to put air in my tire (50psi), the pump burned out just over 40psi. It is extremely light duty."
176731,2,"Broke on the first use. It was not even worth shipping back, so in the trash it went within the first hour. Go figure."
23676,1,"So far this fuel pump is still running strong for the last 4 months, I was surprised to find the actually OEM Fuel Pump on Amazon and at the price I got it for. It was cheaper to purchase on Amazon than the local parts store.All in all the fuel pump works good, good price, what else can I say."
25016,1,"How safe is my trailer? Can't say for sure, even if I hired an armed guard to protect it someone could still get it. So I feel like this product does exactly what it says it does and is very easy to use so I give it 5 stars. In reality it is just a deterrent I suppose. How much effort would it take to crowbar it off? I don't know but I believe it will keep the honest people honest and I do feel better when it is locked on."
31206,1,It's the last Air Filter you will have to buy for your Motorcycle. Easy instructions for install and maintenance.After install I can feel an increase in power and I can see greater MPG.
118977,1,This has a rotating dial on the top that you can adjust. Plug it in and start it and it stops when it gets to the setting. My new car requires 35 psi. To get that I have to set the dial to 37 or 38 psi. Once the dial is adjusted the tires always inflate to 35 psi. Good price and fast delivery from Amazon. Seems rugged.
171505,2,"I ordered this fuel pump and returned it. The main reason I returned it was a notice on the box that the warranty is void if the strainer is not replaced when the fuel pump is replaced. Since I could not find a strainer at Amazon, elsewhere on the internet or locally to buy separately, I wound up buying a complete fuel pump assembly at over twice the price.The Amazon site states that complete installation instructions are included, but the one I received had no instructions with it.I sent Amazon an email detailing the two problems and they paid the shipping both ways. I do appreciate this."
186688,2,"These floormats are very pretty but the ""nibbed"" backing is definitely NOT non-skid. The floor of my car is already carpeted, and these floormats slide around like crazy, needing to be readjusted almost every time I get in the car."
17349,2,"I picked one of these up at a long store a few years ago. We've used it only a few times and it never really seemed to have much of an effect on the temps of the contents. No more so than a cheap cooler bag would've. Finally, this last trip, the motor just gave out altogether and now it won't even switch on. Seems of poor quality"
146109,1,Product arrived quick and did the job I needed it for which was to remove wall mirror. Plenty left to do more jobs
1623,1,This unit does exactly what it promises- a recent storm caused us to lose power overnight- We plugged a window box fan in the unit and it ran about 7 hours- it was a lifesaver- allowing us to sleep comfortably that night. It takes about 24 hours to fully recharge - I would definatley buy this unit again and have recommended the unit to friends and co-workers.p.s.- when it is almost out of power the unit emits a loud beeping noise (like an alarm clock) which scared us -as we were not expecting it - now we know -and so do you.
2383,2,"Maybe it was just my application. I had a pitted winshield. I tried this product and followed directions. Absolutely no results. I understand the concept, but the product must only work in very limited and specific ways."
33595,0,Better have a drill ready during construction. Some holes do not line up no matter what you try. It fits loosely in the hitch carrier and the bike holder isn't turn key. Have several bungee cords ready. Two adult bikes and one child's bike seems to be the limit.
57649,1,This is a great helmet for the price. I ordered a large and that's what I got. It's comfortable and well made. I have two helmets -- one is a full-face -- and this is my favorite.
102964,0,"I kind of walked into this thought as I bought it and I was right. The tape sucks. I drilled two holes through it and then its a good product. Once the holes are in there and its screwed to the wall it really works great. The wood finish is acceptable in my opinion and now I'm happy with it. So, three stars. If they ever get around to predrilling them for me, as it can get tricky because one has to drill straight down at the edge, its five stars."
155426,1,Bought three of these from Amazon because they were over $10 cheaper (per cover) than the RV dealership. Install was easy. I don't believe any cover will allow the vents to open all the way but take that into consideration during the install to get maximum vent opening. Now our RV can vent during all weather conditions and in transit without worry.
104950,0,"I ordered this seat for my Victory Vegas motorcycle, but it was too large for it, so I had to return it. You would really need a wide cruiser-style seat for it to fit and not hang over. Nothing wrong with the seat itself. Good for a car or chair too. The price was right and it was delivered promptly."
4590,1,I have 2 other scangauges in other cars but this is a newer version. I'm going to have to upgrade the older two as the firmware in this model is very good. It tells you anything your PCM will report. Turbo boost is one that is now part of the firmware instead of having to write your own using the programming features. It will give you a miles-to-empty feature if you tell it your gas tank size which none of my vehicles have built in. It's also good to see the real temperature of the coolant which led me to find my Volkswagen thermostat had failed open. You can use the instant MPG feature to alter your driving habits to save fuel and money. Come emissions testing time if you have any Check Engine lights it will tell you what the codes are (then google them for your make and model car) and you can fix them yourself and clear the codes and drive the car around until it is ready to pass emissions.I got it on sale at Amazon and save some money over the ones I already had.. so no complaints there either.
182933,1,What can I say I live in FL and these definitely keep your car cooler and if you are going to get the vent shades you have to get the in channel ones or else they just look crappy.
125211,0,"This seemed like a basic, inexpensive light...comparable to what used to be available at the local auto parts store at double the price. Perfect for the volunteer firefighter just starting out. It is pretty sturdy, but the cord is very short and doesn't really reach to the roof. You can throw it on the dash, but measure carefully as mine doesn't really fit on the dash. A little velcro helps keep it in place. Sometimes the reflector thingy inside spins and sometimes it does not. Effective at night, but not so much during the day. It will hold me until I can get a light bar for the roof."
15244,2,"I have had one for about maybe 2 months and it is already broken. The LCD screen is displaying some garbage such as --.00 anything when I go use it on my tires. I haven't been rough with it, I havent dropped it, run over it with my car, etc. I leave it in my glove compartment and one day it decided not to work.I was trying to find the website or a phone number for the company to see if I could get a replacement, but to no avail. I would not recommend this product."
143081,1,This filter is made a bit sturdier than others I have used on my Mercedes E320. The package includes pictorial instructions to make sure you do not mount the filter element on the spindle upside down.
26256,2,"Batteries died after a year, not dependable because 1 year just isn't enough especially when you need it. Batteries were a major pain to replace. Have to hold it just right to create a good seal. Hard to read LCD at night. Going back to old school large dial gauges."
64366,0,"It won't work on mild to heavy dents or when it's cold outside, but on bumps without a crease (like if you dent it with your knee or a very blunt object) it's great, even if they are big you can work your way through it."
18376,1,"I am very impressed by this product. The key is to use it after the engine is hot, but you have to be careful around hot parts (and FYI I'm not liable for any injury). Don't worry about the hose melting; I stuck it all the way down in the crankshaft and it was fine. The oil was drained in about 5 minutes, and got all of it out as far as I could tell (I ended up re-adding a full 4.5 quarts, which is the indicated capacity of my engine). There is no way I could have done this safely (i.e. at this oil temperature) by draining from the oil pan the old way (i.e. without a fluid evacuator). It's still a messy job, but much less so with this device. One of the best purchases I ever made!"
177483,0,"this stuff seems pretty good, but if you do more than a coat or 2 at a time it takes FOREVER to dry. i was putting finger prints in the surface 2 days after spraying. other than that, it seems pretty good. It shrinks a LOT when it dries, so watch for shrink cracks in the surface and be sure to reapply evenly. it's hard to make this stuff drip, but dont push your luck."
158087,1,This is the cheapest front caliper I could find anywhere for a 1991 Geo Prizm. It looks and fits exactly the same as the OEM caliper it replaced. It works great so far.
48428,2,"This thing isn't good. Just buy a real compressor. You have to set a dial to the pressure you want, plug it in, and it goes until that level is reached and cuts off. No way to just press a button and air comes out. I regret this purchase."
76209,1,Fits perfectly and keeps the handle rattle free. My jack is stored inside my Jeep Cherokee and the last thing I needed was another rattle. I never understood why Hi-Lift just doesn't include them with the jack.
88203,1,"I had my doubts, but, over the weekend I brought home 4, 4"" X 6"" X 12' posts that weighed around 40Lbs each. The ride was only about 5 miles, but these bars carried all 4 posts without a problem.It took a couple of tries to get the straps right, but once I did, they held perfectly.I would, absolutely, recommend these to anyone needing to haul small amounts of lumber for household projects."
64902,1,Time to replace the air filter for my cycle so I decided to try online instead of dealer and picked this high performance air filter. Shipment was very fast. Very easy to install. I would recommend this product and this Seller.
161593,1,this item sure makes life easier - an saves on allot of clean up in the house - outstanding item >!
31921,0,"i've been looking for mary jane's for a while and decided that i'd give these a try since they were so reasonably priced. they also come in wide sizes, and that's a plus. i just received them and i have yet to wear them. i did try them on. while they are super cute, they are also really big. my feet get wider the closer you get to my toes, so my feet are sort of like...ducks feet?! lol. anyway, i imagine these would be comfortable enough for people that have the longer second toe. my second toe is much shorter than my big toe, that combined with the duck-like shape of my feet, causes these shoes to be a bit uncomfortable. the way the toe area is designed it leaves a huge gap between my smaller toes and the end of the shoe, and presses my big toe into my other toes.i realize that the shape of my feet are not the norm, but i know a few other people with similar problems and i thought i'd point these things out. to be make it clear...the toe area has it's longest point in front of where the second toe would be. anyone with a wide width across their toes might find these uncomfortable.they are also a lot bigger than i expected. i usually wear a regular 9 1/2 and these wide width 9's feel a lot more like a 10 or a 10 1/2 to me.they are cute though."
184736,1,This window regulator is constructed very well and fits like it was OEM. Overall I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to replace their window regulator.
24950,2,With in one week the wrist area was getting tore from me just trying to put them on. The palm area does seem like there is enough protection. They do breath well and are not that great in the cold wind. It was an impulse buy and I will not be buying another Joe Rocket Product.
33727,0,"This is my third purchase of the Wagan Heated Seat Cushion--not because I have three cars, but because each one only lasts one season. Yes, the heat very quickly. Yes, the elastics are kind of cheap, but that doesn't really matter. Yes, it's such a deal . . . all of which is why I don't mind buying a new one every winter, they should be labeled Disposable Seat Heaters! Also, buyers should note that the deluxe version does not have a high/low thermostat, but the regular one does . . all for 50 cents less! Go figure."
188249,0,"OK product for the price. Based on the photo, I was expecting the fabric to be a little thicker but it does the job. Two key locks fit in easily (one McGard and one Gorilla spline lock). Definitely better than a ziplock bag."
141078,1,"Extremely fast shipping, great packaging, and super price...excellet!!! It was not that easy so install but got it done, the instructions were great i have no complaints, just a big smile."
75590,1,Great price and excellent shipping...arrived on time and very happy with the fit/install on my son's Polaris 300. It was easy enough that he helped out. Good times
20253,1,Don't drive this vehicle much but so far holding up .I went to electric to eliminate priming when I use it.
66314,2,"I tried these on two different cars and several tires leaked down over a couple of weeks. My first suspicion was these valve caps which turned out to be correct after I sprayed a mixture of soap and water on the caps. There was a very slow leak around the cap seals.Sorry, but this product is a terrible idea because it permanently opens your valves. That's just asking for a leak to occur due to leaking seals, sun-cracked valve housing, etc.The in-tire pressure system may be expensive but at least it doesn't cause a leak in your tires."
146297,1,Pretty cool that you can just crank it up and it'll work. I bought this radio mainly for emergency use when electricity goes out.I do wish it felt a bit better built but otherwise does what it's supposed to do.
143186,0,"Here's my round-up of tire pressure gauges. Prices vary a lot on Amazon. Usually much cheaper if purchased directly from Amazon (free shipping) than from an affiliated seller. So be careful which seller you pick. If Amazon is out of stock, you may want to wait a week or two. Prices below are what I paid, including free shipping.In Jan 2009, I bought two gauges: (a) Moroso 89560 ($40.04), an analog dial gauge, and (b) Accutire MS-5510B ($38.41), a digital dial gauge. I have separate reviews for these two units. Both are good units with a flexible hose attachment and a bleed valve. They are fine in the garage, and fit any tire, but are bulky to keep in a glove compartment if you want to check pressures when you're on the road (for example, if you suspect a leak). I just bought three compact units. All three are analog dial gauges: I don't want battery-powered units stashed away in a glove compartment (extreme high and low temps, and who wants a unit with a dead battery in an emergency?).Same review posted for the following:Milton (MIL) MILS902 $21.63Professional Products (PP) 11101 $9.88Auto Meter (AM) Auto gage 2343 $16.50All five gauges have a range of 0 - 60 psi. My tires run from 28 - 35 psi. Main features to consider:(1) Accuracy. Accuracy is specified with respect to a calibration source. Since I don't have a calibration source, I can't comment on accuracy.(2) Resolution. (a) Accutire. Digital readout. 0.1 psi resolution. (b) Moroso. 2-1/2 in diam dial. Can estimate to nearest psi. (c) MIL, PP, AM. 2 in diam dial. Can estimate to nearest 1 psi.(3) Reproducibility. Repeated 6 readings for each gauge. Expected some air loss for each reading. No noticeable change for analog gauges. 0.5 psi drop total after six readings for Accutire (it's not leakier, it's only because of the higher resolution).(4) Agreement. Ran 5 sequences of the 5 gauges in different order. All gauges agreed within +/-1 psi. This is good news. MIL consistently 1 psi lower than the others, but this is fine.(5) Mechanical.(a) PP and AM appear to be the same gauge, with two minor differences. Don't know if the innards are the same though...can't open the cases. Both weigh 150 gm, so probably the same inside as well. Heavy sheet metal body. Heavy metal neck, chuck, and valve. Heavy plastic dial cover (hard, not tough, plastic though). Tick marks and numbers on AM dial much sharper than on PP. PP comes with fitted plastic case; AM doesn't. Case is low quality though...hard, not tough, plastic; snap fit. Good for stashing in a glove compartment or tool box. But probably will crack and open up if dropped.(b) MIL. Heavy metal neck, chuck, and valve. **Extremely el-cheapo and flimsy plastic body and dial cover.**Common features (MIL, PP, AM):(1) Have a neck with an angled chuck. Non-swivel. PM, AM neck 2 in length. Milton neck about in longer.(2) Have bleed valve. Smooth operation. After gauge is removed, pressure reading is supposed to hold until bleed valve is released. (PP, AM): Reading holds even after 30 sec. (MIL): Reading starts to drop once the gauge is removed (not acceptable).Common negs:(1) None come with a boot. Should be standard. A boot is available, but Amazon doesn't sell it directly. An affiliated seller wants $2.99 + $6.95 shipping. That's more than I paid for the PP gauge itself. I have a couple of 25+ yr old Brookstone gauges that have finally deserved a decent burial. Their rubber boots are still in good shape after all these years, and they fit my new gauges just fine.(2) Gauges without a hose are tricky to use. Many wheels now have spokes, and the valve stems are recessed. Worse, my wife's car has short rigid tire sensors: the stems don't flex at all. If you get a gauge with a straight chuck, the neck is often too short and you can't seat the chuck (the gauge body gets in the way). So these units have an angled chuck. The design is idotic though, because the bleed valve is on the same side as the chuck. Depending on the tire, the bleed valve presses against the wheel when you try to seat the chuck. Not good. There is no swivel head. So if you position the gauge to clear the wheel, you may end up with the gauge oriented such that you can't read it. In which case, it's critical that the bleed valve doesn't leak...that way you can get a valid reading after you remove the gauge. You, of course, lose the capability to overfill the tire a bit and then bleed the pressure to the right value as you look at the dial. So these operate more like stick gauges. In this respect, none of this group of three is totally satisfactory.Summary: Of the three, though, I'd go with the PP. It has the lowest price and has a storage case. It's essentially the same as the AM. It's not worth the extra $ to get the sharper graphics on the AM. The MIL is the most expensive, is the flimsiest, and my unit came with a leaky valve. I returned it. Five stars to Amazon for free return shipping and processing a refund within several days.Note added 8/22/09: Prices fluctuate a lot. Go with either PP or AM. If one is significantly cheaper when you order, go with that one."
143736,0,i needed a new lamp so this one did the trick. it wasnt as bright as i had hoped though... oh well
9561,0,sounded and looked great when i first put it on but now it's getting rusty and raspy after about 5 months. I'm now planning on ordering a custom magnaflow system.
61712,2,Item looks cheap as the edges aren't stitched and the unit does not fall into the dash depressions as expected. It just sits there and looks wrinkly.
166626,0,"I tried lifting my 94 f250 with this, but the strap that holds the actual strap in the upside down ""V"" shape broke because the center caps on my rims made the ""V"" have to spread out too much. What I did was cut the strap off and replaced it with 1/2"" chain and a couple of quick links. This way the chain will be stronger than the original strap and also I am now able to adjust where the hook is along the chain. So it works but if you are going to lift anything heavier than a Jeep, know that you may need to make some adjustments yourself."
9391,1,Bought this off a tool truck about 10 years ago for almost $200. It can still start a big block with a compleatly dead battery. I've seen coworkers go through several cheap boxes (not so cheap in the end) over the years. This jump starter has spent most of its life in the tool box in my truck bed and has never failed.An inexpencive inveter plugged into the outlet will run a compact flouresent lamp for hours in a power outage.
149054,2,"Didn't work upon arrival right out of the package. Absolute junk and at this price, not worth the postage to return it."
71414,1,The perfect product i was looking for. My G35 had lots of dust and particles which were stuck like glue to the paint. This is blessing in disguise. Did perfect job of making my car surface and paint super smooth. loved it. saved me a cool $100 to get it done outside. 2 clays are more than enough to do a complete car. excellent quality cloth too. can't get anything better at such a price.
136483,1,bought this item for my oldsmobile alero 99. everything is great fast shipment. quality of metal better than on original. the thikness of metal thicker than on original. true to size.
31202,1,The fit was perfect. Instalation was easy with the included parts. As far as prefomance it seems to have lmproved the performanceof the motorcycle.
43888,0,"I ordered this to check out a ""check engine soon"" light on my Pathfinder. The unit worked as advertised, and allowed me to read out the code and reset it.The device comes with a CD and a USB cable, but the documentation doesn't mention anything about hooking it to my laptop. I didn't need to do that, but it would have been nice to have some information on it."
68418,0,"I bought a new car back in May but didn't want to be a moving advertisement for the dealership, so I needed something simple that wouldn't rust to frame my plates. These are cheap and thin, but for the price I don't see anything better. They've been on my car for six months now, and they still look new. Granted I take good care of my car so your mileage may vary, but they're not broken or rusted. I was worried at first because the cut edges on the back of the plate sit directly on the paint, but I put on some of those little cabinet door protector nubs and they've stayed on fine, protecting my paint. I wouldn't affix this without them, unless you don't mind scratches."
57040,2,"It's very weak, it doesn't have much power to it! Very disappointed and wish I hadn't bought it!!!!! 2 stars (Only because it got here quickly)"
1099,1,"Great starter. Cables could be a little longer, but that doesn't warrant a lower rating IMO. The fully charged jump starter will maintain its charge for 2 months I believe. The build quality is bulletproof. Ideal for those with an annoying drain (trunk light, amplifier, etc) after the car has been shut off. Ideal for the slightly forgetful :-) Just plug the little guy up to the home socket, leave it overnight and there's your insurance for the next couple months!"

79202,2,"This product comes with two different methods of attachment: magnets (for metal) and metal plates with an adhesive strip (for the typical case of a truck with a bed liner). I stuck the metal strips to the bed liner as instructed, walked back to the house and was just closing the door when I heard the first *clunk* of a light falling off.The problem is that the adhesive strip is just a very thin layer of two sided tape. Truck bed liners typically have some texture to them, so there's no real purchase for such inadequate tape. Adding to the problem is the fact that these lights are heavy. Each contains 2 C-cell batteries.Perhaps these would work on a truck that didn't have a bed liner. I'd doubt that they would be able to hold the lights in place over rough roads, though.Something along the lines of the Dot-It LED light would be a better bet than this product."
165355,2,"The unit I picked up, at a local Auto Parts Store DID NOT contain the correct adapters to fit my bleeder screw so was unusable. My brother happened to have another model which DID have the correct adapter and was able to get the job done using his. The instructions on the package are in error. This is suppose to be a ONE MAN kit, but the instructions say to hold the brake pedal down and then loosen the bleeder screw. My arms are not 8 feet long so that's an impossibility. In reality you're suppose to be able to connect the long hose to the bleeder screw which is left open, then slowly pump the brake pedal until brake fluid with no air bubbles end up in the included bottle. VERY BAD instructions, missing parts, not a good deal."

I did not think elaborate instructions were necessary for a battery charger but there is a 'mysterious' configuration that makes this charger function and I still don't know what it is. I finally resolved my issues by removing the battery from the car and charging it separate from the vehicle; I wanted to charge the battery without removing it (and there are instructions to do this) but no matter what I tried the charger wouldn't begin charging. If you are not up for an auto shop experiment, don't buy this charger."

156240,0,"I've actually gone through two of these so far. The first one lasted for almost 2 years. Unfortunately, this doesn't hold up all that well on a contoured bumper with repeated impact (e.g. parallel parking in Los Angeles, etc.). With the right amount of force this can actually crack instantly.My suggestion to avoid this is to allow for a little give around the screws you'll use to mount this on the bumper. Doing so will allow for a little more flexibility during impacts. Conversely, if your bumper isn't contoured you're not worried about this.For the money, and at the rate of replacement I would say this is worth the purchase."
57185,1,"The product is easy to install with no real complications. My only concern or complaint is that the bags themselves are really small. You look at these things and you seriously wonder if they will hold up to the pressure of a large motorhome. From the advertisements and the literature, you are expecting a bag with two billows but for this application it's only a single. Shocking especially when you consider the coach weighs 14000 pounds. But so far they have held up and have defiantly improved the ride. No more bottoming out."
81557,1,This is one time where you should not follow the directions. It is strechable enough to install without the risk of breaking something while disassembly of gage. Works great and helps protect gage from shock damage.
115132,1,Bought these for a '82 Kawasaki KZ440 and they worked perfect. They were clean and were gapped correctly. The best part is that the terminal connectors can screw off (this was needed for my bike). The B7ES plugs (different manufacturer) I purchased from Walmart do not screw off and I wasted my money on them. Glad I found these on Amazon & with free shipping it was practically a steal. Very happy.

So it's pretty much useless now. Just really cheap quality in my opinion. Really poor finish on the handle too. I would spend a little more & get something better than this junk."
100037,1,Haven't used this tool yet. Hopefully will work in those stubborn plugs. Seems a better idea to pull up on the bottom of the base of the plug wire rather than sqeezing on the plug base itself which seems tighten even more.

38464,0,"I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. I had a small hole from a hail storm that spread a little but. While this did great with the hole, the applicator just didn't force the resin in to the small crack that shot off. I will give it a few days to see if I am wrong but I am assuming I will end up needing professional repairs. As this was a very small repair it fits well within what is claimed for the product. Had I gotten it before the crack spread a bit I think it would have worked, but I believe the plunger just doesn't have the ability to force resin in past the surface."

Maybe I didn't read carefully enough before making the purchase but in order fo this to work you need to have the right door. I will describe as best as possible, but basically the door and the entry to need to align perfectly to give the two pieces that make up this product a chance to meet and sound off. Second, when I sounded the on switch the device just kept ringing regardless if the second piece was beside the main unit or not. I am not afraid to say this might be my human error, but with that said the device was advertised to be a lot simplier than what I experienced and I am the most electonic/tech savvy person I know so this item had to go back:("

23883,2,"Don't buy this charger. Like someone else said, they do not honor their warranty and are rude on the phone. Here's the secret their packaging and instructions don't tell you. If the charger should lose power for any reason such as accidentally bumping the heavy charger from the wall plug, someone turning off a wall switch or circuit breaker tripping; your battery will back-feed through the charger causing the led to light giving the appearance the charger is charging. In this case the charger is worse than no charger at all as the battery will completely discharge into the charger and sulfate. This happened at my hangar and my new (expensive) airplane battery was toast! All the company has to do is spend a few more cents in their circuit design to solve this problem.Last week I connected the POS charger to a battery that needed charging and the charger wall wart got so hot I was afraid it would catch on fire. I found a great fix for these chargers, throw them away! However, I need to add one more stars as my 12 year old son was able to use the battery clips for one of his science fair projects."

Plus of course, the ability to recharge it (via standard ac outlet and throught the car) was very nice! But then the light weakened after about 15 minutes. I had bought the light for power outages, which usually last at least a couple of hours here when it happens, and this just won't do it. It would be okay for other purposes, but if you are looking for something that will last at least an hour or more, this won't be the light for you."

148760,0,"I was searching for CUSTOM FIT floor mats and this product came up. It is NOT a custom mat. We were purchasing for a 2008 Honda Odyssey with tan interior. Although the mats would fit in the car, they do not fit like the factory mats that came with the car and the tan color is not even close to matching any of the interior of the vehicle.The floor mats themselves appear to be good quality, and if you are looking for rugged floor mats and do not care about them being a perfect fit/color, then I would recommend these mats, but I would probably suggest buying the black ones rather than the tan.But if you are looking for a custom mat that matches your vehicle like the factory mats, then you will be disappointed with these.Also to note, these mats are two individual mats that fit in front of the driver's and passenger's front seat. They do not cover the front of the vehicle the way the factory mat does, and would probably require some trimming for an ideal fit."
160117,1,"The product looks great on my car. Good instructions for how to install it but I wish I would have known the complexity of installing this before my purchase.

Anyway, it took the contaminants off my car and make it as smooth as glass. I can tell from using it that it was smoothing out the surface of the car in seconds! And it was fun!

156504,0,"At first this blade worked very well, then a few days in I noticed it was streaking pretty badly coming back down my window shield, right where the blade connects to the frame. I thought it must be debris so I cleaned it and it didn't get any better. I thought well, maybe it needs to break it, or ""set in"" to fit my window better. Two weeks in, no such luck. It seems that the blade has an issue with not applying enough pressure where it mounts. Guess its back to the cheaper Bosch that have worked for me in the past."
84302,1,For as cheap as these were . . . it does the job. I have a Toyota Yaris 2012 and it works nicely.

I used this funnel to pour Seafoam additive into my gas tank and had no problems and it wasn't too awkward even with the weird angle.Not much liquid fits into the funnel so you must pour slowly to moderately. Really, is that an issue? This world is full of crybabies. You want more fluid to fit? Then buy an expensive funnel.

But since I liked the material quality and overall fit otherwise, I decided to cut-in my own pocket access slot in these seat covers.

I have also been using RP's transmission fluid as well .As far as my gas mileage goes , wow , I have seen it go from about 20 city , 30 highway . Too about 25 city , 38 highway .As far as power increase , I can notice that the motor does not have to try as hard when I step on it real real hard . But then again I NEVER red line my car so its kind of hard to say how much more power it can put to the ground using this oil .As far as torque , I can notice that its almost effortless to move itself now.I now have almost 130 k on the car , and have used my whole box I ordered . I will most likely keep using this oil . But lower the weight I use from 10w to 0w .On my last note .I tend to take very good care of my things . When I first got my car , I changed out all the filters , greased the ball bearings , and checked the timing chain . My goal is to get at least 300k out of this car .

I also used it under the door handles where finger nails leave scratch marks and they are completely gone. I tried it on some deeper scratches and it didn't really help, but the product only claims light to medium scratches.

According to my car's computer computed gas mileage, it has remained on avg about the same (Maybe a .2-.3 increase). This is hard to measure as it could be a number of different things. Does it increase performance, I can honestly say that it does feel like it breathes better and it also feels like it has a bit more pull from the low end. Is this in my head? Probably but then again, I don't have to keep buying cheap filters from the oil change places or the dealer. I've been happy with k&n; parts and will continue to buy them even if its just a feeling.Product was exactly as advertised and Amazon Prime is the main reason I shop Amazon. I love it! Keep up the good work."
179899,1,"The Holley 0-4779C Model 4150 is the carb coveted for circle and road track due to the center hung floats, but it also makes an exceptional street carb when mileage isn't so much of an issue. No less is the four corner idle system that makes idle tuning much easier on this carbs two metering blocks and each throttle bore feed - no wimpy metering plate as found in lesser Holley models and ""fixed"" idle air system for the rear barrels, which can cause a ragged idle from the rear throttle bores. Holley also includes blow-out protection in this one for both power valves. The ""C"" in the model number is for CLASSIC - like in the day, 1960's auto dealers touted ""Race on Sunday, Sell on Monday"" - knowing a win at the races on Sunday meant they would be having increased sales of the same style that won come Monday. This carb is also a perfect replacement for many in GM's hot car line-up of those days - like the 327-350 cubic inch ""330-375 Hp"" models. Target RPM range will be 7000 with this carb and these engines - but don't go there without a properly prepped bottom end, heads, and valve train system. 7000 RPM is race engine territory that few OEM built engines can reliably withstand much of.If you have better than a 5-liter engine, this 750 CFM carb is a good starting point for upgrades - and much higher horsepower levels than stock. This one also has the air bleeds in the air horn calibrated for 350-400 cubic inch rides - important as big blocks and two-four setups require different air horn bleeds. Just make sure your fuel lines and fuel pressure system is up to feeding it what it needs.The front and rear power valves can be easily replaced by removing the bowls - important if you have changed the engine vacuum with a larger duration camshaft profile - along with that compression increase you probably needed. This 750 is easily capable of supplying proper fuel calibration in the 400 horsepower range - if you have the needed changes in your engine.What you also get is Holley's famous float adjusting system for adjusting bowl levels, and front and rear jet changes are quickly made by removing the bowls. One thing, this is a performance carb, but it isn't for an all out drag car without changes to prevent starving and flooding fuel bowl level changes under severe acceleration - but it can be modified for extreme use. Even the carbs fuel pumps can be adjusted. This model is an ""easy tuner"" for the experienced old school ""Bad to the Bone"" racer.The manual rear barrel linkage means you don't have any wimpy vacuum lag opening the rear barrels when you hit the accelerator - the engine has what it needs instantly, and it's not for fuel mileage! The choke is manual, but you can still upgrade that to electric if wanted.I installed myHolley 0-4779C Model 4150 Double Pumper 750 CFM Square Bore 4-Barrel Mechanical Secondary Manual Choke New Carburetoron a stage two built blueprinted 355 CI Chevy in a '55 Buick Special 2-dr. The engine has port matched gaskets, Edelbrock Victor Jr. CNC intake and CNC Brodix Track 1 heads for starters - and makes 468 horsepower! There's a big difference in this car from the old nail-head it came with! Heavy Buick? Yes, just like the platform it shares with mid-'50s Chevy rides. You've just got to love the Buick's factory ""bullet hole"" fenders - remember Broderick Crawford in ""Highway Patrol"" with his Buicks. I'm sure he would have liked to be behind the wheel of this one."

132739,1,"This is a good quality multimeter at a fairly reasonable price. Has all the functions that one would normally need for automotive use. The clamp-on wire feature is good for measuring RPMs while tuning up. The only drawback for this unit is that the instruction booklet is very poorly written. There are at least a half dozen spelling mistakes that are very obvious. The instructions are very basic and do not really help the novice in knowing how to use the unit for different automotive tests and do not always clearly show how to hook up the leads for measurements. It would also be nice to have the self adjusting scale range on this unit for the price range that it is in. Other than that, I think if one is looking for a multimeter in this price range, they will quite satisfied with this unit."

They are great forpouring stuff out of gallon bottles into smaller containers, but there usedto be a pink version with a smaller outlet that was even more useful. Still,my only problem with them is that they are a bit stiff to turn, and openingthe spout is likely to start to remove the spout from the bottle instead,but maybe that will go away with use. The stiffness is the only reason notto get a 5 star rating."

41766,0,"You get what you pay for, I guess.On the plus side, the shifter is attractive and well priced. The materials, however, feel very cheap. The surface, which feels like those cheap toilet-paper-roll rods (you know, that really light plasticky fake metal feeling), deteriorated quickly. The knob also doesn't tighten well to the shifter rod, so it requires frequent tightening and always wobbles a bit for me.Still, it's usable, and the price is right."
133575,1,"This product turned the grey, faded the fenders of my 1999 Jeep Wrangler black! They look like new from a distance and very good up close too! I took a previous reviewers advice and used a disposable foam brush to apply the product and it worked great. It will require several coats if you have a lot of fading, but 1 kit did all 4 fenders and I still have some left over. I definately recommend it. I did this about 5 months ago and they still look great."
95064,2,"Reese Towpower 37042 Class III Multi-fit Receiver HitchBuying a REESE Hitch thru Amazon.com, from REESE was extremely frustrating as it had multi problems. Missing bolts an nuts, that cost me an extra $20 an gas, plus lost time, very confusing directions that indicated that it fit an extended van, rather than a stardard van as per the Amazon information. PLUS even worse,, the bracket furnished with the hitch, did not fit my van, until I ground off more than 1/2 inch of a corner, to make it fit, so it was designed wrong from the get go.A phone Call too REESE Customer Service, was also a waste of time, she told me to read the directions, which did not say anything about having to modify the hitch, drill four holes, or have to buy expensive extra bolts, to make it work properly.Only thing can assume, as I have used REESE product for more than 30 years, is that they have gone to CHINA like so many other good companies.WILL NOT BUY REESE PRODUCTS ANYMORE, plus there was a wrong number for a wiring kit, from REESE, according to a printed catalog at a local dealer, NO such part number exists, an when I tried to order it, the REESE web site, told me the same thing. NO WIRING KITS for the ASTRO Vans, even tho they sell the hitch..Customer Service at Amazon was not helpful either, so I am looking elsewhere for many products, rather than Amazon. They told me, not much Amazon can do too correct the problems with REESE Products. So three hours for a 30 minute job, extra $20, an NO HELP from either customer service, REESE or AMAZON,,,that is pretty bad, an they want us too buy American products."

12714,0,"This flexible hose needs to do two things: 1) spray water vigorously, and 2) not leak. It sprays water pretty well, but as others have mentioned, it leaks near the shut-off valve. Mine also leaked at the hose connection, with a hose that doesn't leak when attached to other stuff. Bring a towel or two with you.We have a San-T-Flush unit in our RV which is supposed to clean out the black water tank, but the San-T-Flush system doesn't clean the plumbing. This Swivel Stik goes from toilet down to the tank so you can reach every inch of plumbing.The spinning nozzle might hit the walls of your plumbing and make alarming vibrating noises. I don't think this is much of a problem, since you can usually adjust the hose to prevent the nozzle from hitting stuff. Be prepared for some noise, though, unless your plumbing goes straight down to the holding tank with no angles.Better than nothing, for sure!"
14117,0,"I have used Back to Black for years under a variety of conditions. During that period I have learned many things through trial and error as others have expressed in their reviews.The high viscosity was never a problem for me. In fact, I find that low viscosity products, such as paste wax, are much more difficult to work with because they collect in difficult in tight spaces where they are difficult to remove. For best results you must pour the liquid on the vehicle in level, broad areas and you must pour a lot of it on a rag when applying it to other areas.As the liquid is applied it should be rubbed in and then allowed to penetrate the surface for several minutes. If you don't remove the excess, there will be streaks after the next rain. Worse yet, the product will redistribute itself on windows if applied to trim and not wiped off.How long the black finish lasts depends on a few factors, such as rain and washing frequency. Overall, the black shine will not remain for a long time. If you don't re-apply it every couple months, you will be sorry. For vehicles that are kept outdoors, instead of in sheltered parking or in a garage, the black shine will not last very long at all. A few days of rain will remove it. The bottom line is that Back to Black is a car care product that must be re-applied regularly. It is not a once-a-year solution."

98137,2,Not very good quality. Broke first time I used it(spot welds broke on back). May be able to repair with weld.
36901,1,Easy to replace my old one. Exact fit with all holes in the right place. Look much better with the new shield. Memphis Shield is best product.
182711,2,"I ordered this item in late-June and made the mistake of not using it until now (early October). The product quality is lackluster at best. The permanent crimped fittings on the hose do not make proper seals and the 'rapid' connector from the hose to the compressor failed to seal properly as well. After 2 hours of trial and error between myself and a friend (a retired mechanic), we gave up on this unit as we witnessed its complete inability to inflate any tire. Sadly, the return window expired in July and I am now stuck with an expensive piece of junk. It was my mistake for not thoroughly testing the unit upon initial shipment. Lesson learned."

However with this hitch, I didn't have to worry about having someone weld the bar, or that I would every have to worry about that weld failing while pulling my trailer. This sway control adapter set up very quickly and is rock solid. The only problem I had was that the shank of my old 2"" ball was not long enough which required me to purchase a new ball. It was probably a good idea to do this considering the old ball had some rust given it 30-year age. I rate this product with 10 gold stars and 5 super-smiley faces."

The very next thing I did was throw the bottle in the trash.What kind of a tire shine product dissolves wheel rims?! Does this stuff have hydrochloric acid in it? For me, this would be like buying car wax that eats through the paint.Everyone should absolutely stay away from this product in the off-chance that it has an acidic chemical reaction with your wheel. Now I'm left with the prospect of purchasing a new rim..."
65823,2,You get what you pay for with this mirror. It works- but when you are driving there is a fluttering from the car's vibration and it is very noticeable. The mounting of the whole system is stable- its just that the quality is cheap and the mirror flutters. If that doesn't bother you- then go for it.
131260,1,This product is really great every time I use it I am amazed. I would highly recommend this to anyone
34354,1,"I purchased a 3600si shortly after they first came out a couple years ago. Mine had an hour meter on it that didn't work. I called and got a replacement meter that does work. I really have not used the genset extensively. I have gone out on some work sites where I needed power and it's worked very well in those situations. Run times typically were about 8 hours at a time.I noted that the engine would surge and run poorly when I first got it. I found the design of the unit places the fuel shut off really low on the fuel line. When the fuel is cut off (for storage)it creates a bubble of air that is difficult to remove. Once re-started, the motor will starve for fuel with the bubble in place and the valve back on run. Starving for fuel will make the motor surge and the unit will not produce full power. Figured out if I tilted the unit on the side it would burp the air bubble in the fuel line and the motor would then run just fine. I believe this issue is common on this generator as I have read many other reports of surging and no power. This is just a poor design.Once running well the generator produces good power. I built an extension cord with multiple outlets to plug into the 30A socket. I dont have an RV so can't give you a good feel for how well it runs AC units and all. I did do some load testing by running an heat gun, and a large heater at the same time. I measured just at 24A of current. I ran this for an hour or more when I first got it to stress test it. Seemed to work just fine.The quality of the unit was cheap. Yes you get what you pay for. The stickers on the plastic housings are paper backed and will come off over time. The housing is OK but not great. It runs and runs well so can't really can't ding it to bad for doing the job it's built for. If you want something that is a 100% reliable then get a Honda or Yamaha. If you don't mind tinkering and are mechanically inclined this can be a great deal. Just don't expect this to be completely trouble free all of the time."
130053,0,"I bought these for my 98 m3 4 door, they are working fine but I was disappointed with the price and fitment. There are two studs available for each of the roof rack mounts and these clips only use one of the studs. I bought my Yakima rack used, and it came off of a jetta with Q103 clips. The Q103 clips actually used both studs for each mount but the bend in the clip was slightly off and I want to have the correct fitment. It would have been nice if the Q18 clips used both available studs, and remember the package includes 2 clips, you will need 2 packages (4 clips) to fit your car."
116537,2,"The actual silicone delivered from this canister is excellent quality and performs well for preventing vibration induced loss of mechanical items. However the delivery valve and mechanism leave a lot to be desired. I use small quantities over a number of weeks and after about 5 screw-on-screw-off uses, the threads on the valve begin to overhaul, the valve fails to shut completely with consequential hardening of the silicone in the dispensing nossle and necessary removal and shoving a screwdriver into it to unjam the solid material.I bought a box of these and although the dispensed product works well I would not recommend this and I will not be purchasing further items with this type of dispensing mechanism. It is a pain to have to start every use dismantling and clearing the nossle and using a pair of pliers to push the valve because the plastic threads have overhauled. I would not recommend this dispensing mechanism unless you intend to use the entire contents in one session."
18354,2,"Worked OK when it did, which was about 2 years. I must have used it less than 10 times during those 2 years. Then it started leaking, sputtering oil through the handle. The manufacturer said the seals went bad and that it was not repairable."

So, I used one key chain, I do not know which, for a couple of weeks and then the logo fell off and got lost.The base item seems to be well made, but the method used to attach the logo is very poor."
171914,1,Scratch X 2.0 works great. Sure it takes some work to get the scratch out but no one ever said buffing out a scratch was easy. I have a black Challenger and I have removed some good size scratches without damaging the clear coat. This stuff is worth every penny and has saved me some serious money in body work.
123867,2,I plugged in this blanket and after waiting three hours I tested the temperature with an infrared thermometer. It reached a whopping three degrees warmer than the sofa it was draped over. Either this one is defective or just a piece of junk. I am suspecting the later. I think the good reviews on here are from road pro.
135270,1,Thank you! I was skeptical at first but everything was perfect! The best part of it was that there were bulbs with that headlight! The cost of the bulbs alone is half the value. I am going to order the other side next. Thanks again!
21476,1,"I purchased my first pair of these gloves six years ago on a whim. They quickly conformed to my hands and became my favorite riding gloves. I liked them so much, my wife got a pair in pink that she loves as well.After six years, the velcro closure is starting to lose adhesion and is also coming loose. The leather has held up beautifully and they have a great well-worn look and feel. Given the closure issues I am having, I just ordered a replacement pair and will happily break them in as soon as they arrive.These are certainly not warm gloves and in chilly or cold weather, you will want a heavier glove. For all other occasions, these fit them bill perfectly."
123236,1,I have used it only a few times so I can only give a partial opinion on this hitch. It is of solid construction and has performed admirally so far. I couldn't get the ball to release from the trailer hitch and had to pull the pin and drive off the hitch mount. It survived that without a scratch. The only problem is that it's a four inch drop and as it turns out I needed just a two inch drop. That's not the fault of the hitch.

41839,1,"My neighbor is a mechanic, and looked this part up for me after the fan in my 2005 Chevy Silverado 2500HD stopped working. I called the dealer to get a price on this item and it was $132.00 just for the part. That's not including the diagnosis fee or labor of $100.00 per hour. The part literally took 5 minutes to replace and fit and worked perfectly. Apparently, this is a common problem in the Chevy and happens often."
26887,1,Noticed the performance difference. Floppy rubber replaces rigid plastic oem filter and seals air box. A must have for performance.
6869,2,"I guess before I bought these, I should have looked to see the geographical location of the people who reviewed these chains. Let's see... one was in Las Vegas(the desert) and the other was in Southern California (also the desert). With tire chains not something they regularly use in that neck of the woods, these flimsy little tire chains might actually work. Even when properly sized, faced with a New England snowfall, these strings with springs broke on the very first rotation of the tire. Do not use these chains in any environment in which you might need to rely on them for traction or safety as they are sure to disappoint and you could conceivably put yourself at risk.These are going back to Amazon - a complete disappointment and waste of money for those who need strong, reliable tire chains."
20861,1,"I installed this on a 2000 Silverado. The kit fit however they sent the wrong fuse. The instructions were ok, easy to follow. Shortly after installing the fans it became obvious I needed a larger alternator to handle the load. (take this into consideration). After all is said and done it does what I needed it to do so I am happy with it. I only had issues with the parts in the kit."

80151,0,"I practiced putting these chains on my truck while it was in my garage. Initially I thought the chains were the wrong size and I went on line to confirm I had purchased the correct product. Thus assured I returned to the garage floor and tried again with success. I removed the chain and practiced anew. Success.I have yet to put on four chains but in Colorado if I ever need one, I'll need four. I dread thinking what putting four of these on will be like if I'n not on a surface as smooth and accommodating as my garage floor and working with frozen fingers. The guy in the video makes it look easy so maybe I just need more practice but I'll only practice in the garage where the ground is smooth and even and my fingers are warm. :)"

84777,2,Though this product looked great and arrived in a timely matter. It did not fit my truck. We tried everything. I drive an f150 and it just wouldn't fit. I think I am glad it did not now after reading some of the other reviews. If I had read them first I would not have purchased this product. I couldn't have dealt with the smell even if it did fit.

I was unable to find any nice mats comparable to the OEM GM carpeted mats locally so I took a chance on these. I will admit they are a little better than the cheap ones sold at the auto parts stores, but not by much. These are light weight and the ""plush"" is not very plush at all.Edited to say these mats are awful. I only used them for a few weeks because it was shedding so bad. It was all over my pants every time I got in the car. I washed them, vacuumed them and they still shed..."
23475,0,"The shoulder pad does the job, but it has one downfall. The inside material is a cheap, noisy fabric. Kind of like those athletic pants that constantly make a swishing sound as you walk.... Some people may not be bothered by it, but it drives me crazy as I drive. Every time I hit a bump or reach to make a turn, I hear it. None of our previous shoulder pads had noise issues. I bought it for the driver's seat, but moved it to a rarely used back seat. Thankfully, I only bought one.It is a little bulky, but not bad. It easily slides up and down the seat belt. Perhaps that is the reasoning behind the cheap, noisy fabric in the middle?Overall, I would not purchase it again."
69495,2,"I bought this 300 watt inverter to to charge battery, but I realized it wasn't chargeing. I checked voltage output and it was only giving me around 90 volts AC."
93570,2,I purchased one of these several years ago. The pin that holds the locking latch came loose which resulted in the latch popping off and the ball coming loose. Eventually the trailer broke free with the ball still in the reciever. This resulted in a major accident with injuries. A wise person would spend the extra money on separate hitches with a real ball attached.
123926,1,The kit came with everthing needed and then some. I think I still have anough left over to clean my filter one more time.
17954,1,"I really like the Motley Tube. If you're looking for real cold weather riding gear, use common sense and get something heavier (a Schampa neck gaiter, for instance) but in cool to hot conditions this thing is great. It prevents chaffing from jacket collars. It will prevent some air flow around the jacket collar. You can soak it in water (wring it out) and wear it around the neck for cooling. It also, for me, prevents my dirty helmet from soiling my shirt collar when I'm riding to work. It is very soft and comfortable.Though you can certainly use this as a great layer in cold weather, it is NOT a heavy garmet that ""stands alone"" in cold weather and should not be purchased for that purpose. For cool to hot conditions, looks and versatility the Motley Tube works very well."
126441,0,"I hope every one knows that this is a Reconditioned part and it should be price as a reconditioned part, Note: This is not a new Distributor"" ( the price is a little to high, the price should be more like $45.00 to $50.00 dollars )"
158890,1,Product came in a well protected container with very easy to follow instructions for application.I would recomend this company to any one.I will deal with them again.
175382,1,Don't skimp when it comes to your battery Optima makes the best battery I have ever used and they are very easy to maintain with the proper smart charger.
25120,1,"I just got the scanner today in much faster time than I expected. I have a 1996 Geo that has the check engine light on. I plugged in the scanner and it found two codes. It was able to erase one but the other one won't go away, so that part needs to be replaced or fixed (P0758 Shift Solenoid B Circuit Electrical). This scanner saved me time, money and trouble. I just assumed it was an O2 sensor since it was never replaced and the car has 125K miles on it, and I was going to buy one and put it in. Glad I didn't. I highly recommend this scanner for everyone. Just plug it in and it does the rest. Very user friendly!"
134555,1,"Installed the unit 1 week after purchasing a 2004 S2000 which was stock. Needless to say, the S2000 now sounds as good as it like it looks. My neighbor noted that it sounds like it should. Installation took about 2 hours. Instructions could have been more detailed but were sufficient. Materials are basic, some of the connecting hoses are already planned for replacement with higher quality materials. The difference between stock and with this unit installed is evident when jumping on it, the engine now screams but doesn't sound like a weedeater on steroids. Definitely worth the purchase cost."
81476,2,"I ordered these 15 inch wheel covers for my Honda. Unfortunately, this company sent me the wrong size (14 inch), so they are useless."
8788,0,"The generator in itself is just what I needed.The 1st,unit, upon arival was damaged to the point of not being safe to opperate.(damaged fuel delivery system, broken carb.& fuel tank) Amazon was very quick to respond by shipping another unit. After two weeks of waiting I finally received the second unit which was also damaged. Not as seriously as the first one. I am now in contact with the number included on the packaging to obtain service,It too needs a fuel tank to replace the damaged one on the second unit I received. Still no joy!I couldn't recomend this brand to anyone because of my experiance, inconvieniance and disapointment so far.John Kola"
25775,2,Worst filter purchase in my life. Removed it from the box to install and the plastic end fell off. Then after looking saw that the other end was about to come off. Looks like the ends of the filter did not get glued to the paper correctly. Compared to OEM item this was not even in the same league. Purchased for 2009 Pontiac G3.
95632,1,I love it and would recommend them for all vehicles very protective and cover everytjing spill proof great worth the money!!
87510,0,"This tool accepts four sizes of blind rivets and secures them effectively and straightforwardly. There is no need to access the other side of the pieces you are riveting together, provided you can drill them and compress them together from one side. To use the riveter, simply insert the flanged end of a rivet into the opening in the nose, press the unflanged end of the rivet into a hole of the proper diameter, and squeeze the handles. The rivet will expand against the sides of the hole, holding the pieces together with a compression fit, like a nail.Be aware that this tool does blind riveting, not through riveting. The effectiveness of the connection depends on close tolerances and hard materials. The rivets are fundamentally hollow cylinders of metal with small flanges on one end. A bit of wire much like a finishing nail passes through the rivet and out the flanged end. The tool grips the wire and pulls it through the rivet so that the &quot;nailhead&quot; on the unflanged side of the rivet causes it to mushroom slightly.If you need a more secure connection like that provided by a through bolt, nut, and washers, and have access to the opposite side of the pieces to be connected, a through riveter would be a better choice."
153652,2,"the corners do not stay nice and flat against the seat, as shown in the photo. My seat protector droops and folds down at the top corners, leaving the seat exposed...which is where my toddler plants her feet. The pocket also sags open, which pulls the seat protector forward so that it bows out. I may have to rig it somehow - maybe add some straps and secure the seat protector around the seat so that it doesn't droop and sag so badly."
160569,1,This fuel cap was as described and fit my Saturn Ion 2004 as promised. It was less expensive then buying from area dealers. It arrived promptly. I had it put on when I had my car inspected because I have hand function issues. Otherwise I think anyone could install it.
53690,1,"The Battery Tender Jr looks like a quality ""smart"" charger that should solve our auto battery issues. We leave our truck idle for months while we're off sailing and we always returned to a dead battery. I started disconnecting the battery, which worked, but required resetting all the presets and sound settings on our audio system each time. This seems to be an inexpensive solution to the problem and probably much better for battery health and longevity."
12,2,"I purchased this for my 2004 Kia Optima LX. When I went to install it, everything seemed good. But the car was about an inch wider than the hitch and the hitch was not centered in the car. So either the hitch was off center or the car's mounts were. Otherwise seemed like a great hitch."
115952,1,I got the deal of the day @ $6.99 as I needed a filler for free shipping and thisis actually a decent set I do not know if it is worth $20.00 as I have not used it enough yet the metal case is sturdy and opens up displaying the drills nicely.
69757,1,Iam so very satified with this door handle.This product is very durable which was a concern of mind.Iam very happy with this product.Thank you very much
69306,0,"So far this product is exactly as described.My only complaint is that it has a small fan that stays on even after the battery has been fully charged on a 2amp trickle charge setting. It would have been nice that once the battery has been fully charged (100% charged), the battery would turn itself off along with the fan. That is the main reason for the 3 star rating."
42942,2,"I ordered two of these parts because MOOG is supposedly good stuff. One was similar to the picture but had no zerk fitting. The other was completely wrong. I sent the wrong one back and they sent me one that had a nylock nut instead of a castle nut and still no zerk fitting. Also the top nut diameter was much smaller. At that point Amazon gave up and I sent both back.I then ordered two more from another place. One looked just like this picture, with zerk and all. The other looked like the second one Amazon sent. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaH!!!!!!!!!!!All the boxes look identical K9011."
52400,0,"Installed it in my 2006 Honda Pilot EX-L with factory DVD entertainment. I also purchased the 791 universal bypass module. I had to place a key inside this bypass module so it can read the chip that's in the key. That feels a little weird; leaving a key inside a locked car, but that was the only way to get it to work. Also downloaded the wire color chart for my car from the bulldog website, but many of the colors did not match. Installation instruction could have been a little clearer, but at the end was able to figure it out. Took me almost 6 hours to install it. The video was somewhat helpful. If you're not an experienced installer hire a professional. Must have good knowledge of wiring and cable testing. I'm a ""seasoned"" mechanic and it took me a while to get everything hooked up.RANGE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ADVERTISED DISTANCE.The max distance is about 200 feet. For Honda Pilot owners: don't by the T-harness. It will not work on Honda Pilots. I had to send back the one I bought. Also if you want to use the original Honda key for the door locks; once you start the car with the remote starter you will not be able to open the doors with the remote. Must use the key at the driver side to open the door. Hold the key in the open position for about 2 or 3 seconds and it will open all the doors. I'm seriously thinking about returning the main remote start unit and upgrade to a higher distance system."
14562,0,"i was changing front brake pads on a 2004 mercury monterey. in order to get the tool into the 2 piston without disassembling two more bolts i had to bust the black handle off with a hammer. then i could slip it through the caliper holes and tighten it down with a pair of vise grips on the end. worked good then. if it was designed without a handle and the end made to use with a socket and ratch wrench, it would fit many more calipers"
40216,1,"Picked this up for my 2012 Busa. Great fit, simple change out, K&N quality. Around town theres not much difference felt, but once you hit the open road and un-wind the bike, you can totally feel the difference.....great product"
102401,2,"I've used 3-in-1 oil since 1955. It's a good product but this container with its telescoping spout is a bad idea. I'm not sure why it telescopes, since my arms works pretty well in that regard, but the real difficulty is with the shut-off nozzle at the tip. If you touch the tip to the item you're oiling, it depresses the shut-off valve, defeating the purpose of the dispenser. If you're doing something like oiling a bicycle chain you need three hands - one to rotate the chain, one to hold and squeeze the oil container, and third to keep the tip from retracting. The original metal can is much easier to use. I will continue to use 3-in-1 oil but will not purchase it in this container."
142693,1,"I've tried all the rest, from the cheapest dollar store to high end 2"" trucker straps, Ancra is the only brand that makes a cam lock that doesn't loosen and a ratchet that work well and doesn't rust up instantly. Buy the best and have them out last the competition until you end up replacing all your crappy ones with Ancras!"
155534,0,"The adapters work well, but the red and blue tag was just tape and came off after first use. Not hard to keep track of, but cheap solution to marking item does not work."
99728,1,Good product the quality of the neoprene seems very good will see how much will last in my Jeep Grand Wagoneer 1990
122187,1,We use this jump starter everyday usually several times a day to help guests at our commercial shopping center. It works much better than any other type of jump starter pack and what I like best about it is that you can replace the battery when it no longer holds a charge. No need to buy another jump pack. It will definitely save money in the long run. Those cheap imitation jump packs can't stand up to repeated chargings and uses.
8967,1,"They fit well and worked well. They do not wiggle loose. Hand wiring connections will not work, and this loom is plug and play."
173610,1,"The frames are well finished, tough, and easy to install. The frames are made in a way that doesn't obscure the plate and cause issues at inspections. Mounting hardware is elegantly obscured. I suggest buying through Amazon rather than directly through the manufacturer to avoid (or reduce) the shipping charges of the manufacturer. The frames aren't cheap, so this helps keep the overall cost down."
126002,1,"It's not the TOP grade of leather, but perfectly adequate for a MC jacket. Well made. Nice zip out lining. Runs a bit small ( order sizes up). Fast shipping."
139241,0,The creeper is a little cramp and the head rest is hard and not replaceable. Cramp your legs. I would not buy again. Look at one some place and try on before buying. The wheels do not look that good. Pressed togeter like any of the cheap creepers. Too much slop in wheels.
128235,1,Pros:Plug and play.Easy to read diagnostics.Cons:Would have been nice if there was a pouch to go with it.
14120,2,"I purchased this product to shine up the gray and black trim on my 2003 Vibe with 110,XXX miles. On the black trim, both glossy and flat - wow! Excellent product. Removes oxidation, and gives it a single color, just great. However, on the gray it was a most horrible product. Now, you are saying: ""Wait! This is Back-to-Black, why did you use it on non-black trim?"" Well I used it on the gray because both labels said I could with the same effects as the black, no matter the trim color. However, on the gray it was runny and splotchy. For this they recommend that I buff harder, I did every level of buffing until my power buffer came out. I used my 6"" power buffer to no avail; still splotchy and runny. I tried again on a later date and had the same results. In short, the product though marketed for use on all trim is in fact only useful for black trim, or at least my experience proves this."
32749,1,This battery installed perfectly into my 2003 Mazda Protege ES. Have not had any problems since the installation (about 2 months ago). I performed the install myself and it did take a little time as their are no instructions provided and it is not obvious how to install this battery wtih the red plastic height adapter that is provided (may not be needed depending on your car).
91576,1,"I've orderd these before and love them. The blade is covered with a rubber sheath which keeps the snow and ice from messing up the works.Jeep Wranglers have small blades but with pretty upright windshields that tend to keep the wet elements sliding down, but unfortunatley, we suffer more from rock and gravel strikes.There are simple instructions on the back of the box, but basically, one clips off the old blade, clips on the new- 15 seconds- done. With heavy use, they last simillar to tires, at least for me, 4-5 years.The ends are red tipped which match my red vehicle. They also include a few adjustment pieces for other fittings.Of interest, the shipping cost was more than the cost of the blades! Therefore, I bundled it with another item I needed from Amazon to get free shipping. For me, this made them cheaper than trying to buy locally."
1687,2,I have this about 14 months...Over the last 14 months I used this about 4 times...Now it will not recharge...COMPLETE KRAP!!!Do NOT buy this brand...
139548,0,"I've used this unit for about a month with pretty good results. Does keep the battery up, although the cranking power is a little low in extreme cold. But it does start everytime. I use it on a compact utility tractor that is outside covered only by a tarp."
118168,0,"The lights are great for our use, but as has been the problem for the last month or so, there is only ONE mounting bracket in the box with the lights. Two are needed.I had to contact the manufacturer to get the other brackets. This is a recurring problem since it seems like there had been a breakdown in qaulity control.Pilot is aware of the natinwide problem."

Received the product promptly. It's not a factory replacement but good none the less.
142092,2,"Wasnt what the picture showed it to be, will not buy anything for just the view from a picture it was very miss leading. Will not be doing any kind of business with this kind of miss leading ad."
140003,0,"It doesn't remove anything so why call it a polish??? Great stuff for a perfect clean surface. Nice shine, I got it for a Black paint finish and didn't want to leave any of the normal white residue. Put it in a spray bottle and did inside wheel wheels and under car. Doubt I will every buy again."
152332,0,"These were easy to install, only double stick tape. After only a few weeks, the bottom ends near the mirrors are pealing up. There is a plastic cover in this area, not the paint surface like the rest of the door. I did clean them with the alcohol pads in the kit. I will have to remove all the tape and re-stick them now. They do look good."
6174,1,"I used this product when I was a teenager, 35 years ago, it was the best then and still is now. Can't get it in the parts store anymore.. but thanks to amazon I have found it also purchased for use on clear coat it is just as great.. Thanks"
126823,1,"With batteries getting so expensive everyone should have one (or more) of these. I have 4 of them and they work great. They auto sense 6 or 12 volt and tell you if the battery will charge or not, when it's charging and when it's charged. So far they have done an excellent job of maintaining my batteries. Not big enough to do jump starting, but excellent for maintaining/charging batteries. Comes with plug in cable options for clamps or screw on lugs."
113603,1,good fit just as advertised it was also easy to assemble it was priced about what I thought it is Worth so a good value.
156867,1,"had standard wipers from the auto glass company on here before. They streaked a lot and wore out quickly. I've only had these a week so no word on how long they'll last, but the wipe streak free and give great visibility"
35001,1,"I have had great results with this product. Over the years I have sent a bunch money trying expensive waxs in an attempt to outshine and outlast Collinite 845. I have found some that shine marginally better but at great cost. I start with a properly prepared surface and apply 2-3 coats 24 hours apart. Then over the summer I add a few more coats because I park at the airport all the time and jet soot is very acidic. Once winter comes and it's too cold to wash and wax I just go though touches washes and the salt/grime slide off. After winter the car still has 845 on it. Sometimes I don't even have to polish down the surface, a big time saver! All the while I have a great shine. On bottle lasts me about 2 years for 2 cars and I wax a lot. Shake well. Some reviews gave the product a low rating because it would not do things like take off water spots. This is the wrong product to correct paint problems. You will need polish and clay to make the surface smooth and swirl free first if perfection is what you are looking for. Although, I'll add it will hide some swirls if you are not real picky."
25544,2,Could not get this to work in my vehicle. Regardless this should be a $2.99 item in my opinion. Wish I had returned. The flap is too flexible and wouldn't fit on my windows.
120644,0,"Save yourself cramps and frustration. The squirt bottle for the cleaner is pathetic. Your fingers will be in pain before your filter is clean. On top of that, the 'drip on' method of oiling the filter does not work well. It takes forever for the oil to spread throughout the filter (many hours).When I do this again, I'll just buy bulk cleaner and the aerosol oiler."
161107,0,Product arrived on time and in good condition installation was easy with no modification needed. The step does not protrude the vehicle frame very far so I find myself stepping over it instead of using it.
25494,0,"The reason I gave 3 stars is so people wouldn't be totally turned off to this product and hopefully read this. I love DASHMAT's products. I get them for all my vehicles, and have ordered them for others. But I've ordered 3 in the past few weeks from Amazon that says it will fit my car (they didn't). It says it will, but it never tells you what year it was you ordered before checking out. I finally had to go to the DASHMAT website to get the product number that fits my car, and then come back to Amazon to match up the numbers. After 3 strikes, I finally hope I get the right one."
10771,1,"great little pump, got my 2.8 quarts of redline into my transmission faster than expected, with scant drops spilled between bottles, what more could you ask for the price?To those who say this does not fit red line oil bottles, well - it's true, it doesn't screw securely on, but it does fit, and the draw tube reaches the bottom of the bottle, so while it doesn't screw onto the bottle neck (redline bottles are a hair smaller than ""normal"") it does work with redline just fine.The pump does take some pumps to get a quart transfered, but not near as bad as what I was expecting from other review here. I think it took longer for me to remove the plug, drain the old oil, and replace the plug than it did to pump the new back in through the top fill - so not too shabby I don't think for an inexpensive little transfer pump."
162504,1,"Two hole gauge panel, chrome. Driver quality chrome, not show quality, but looks good with my Auto Meter gauges. I had a hard time finding one of these, usually the 2 hole panels are black. It arrived promptly and mounted no problem. If you need a 2 hole chrome gauge panel, this is a good one for the money, not to mention I couldn't find it anywhere else in stock."
164599,2,"I just re-read the description, and the above seat cover description is a gross misrepresentation. It incorrectly, if not fraudulently indicates that the covers were customized to fit my specific model. The covers are a sloppy fit, especially on the passenger side, and the controls that are not completely covered are available only through wide sloppy generic openings obviously made to account for any number of general configurations."
75199,2,"Brand new generator out of the box no apparent damage. I filled it with oil and gas, connected the ground terminal with 12awg ground wire to a building ground. Started the unit and my ground detecting surge protection equipment went into alarm and my APC UPS would not charge. Greenlee GT-10 circuit tester indicated open ground. Installed ground rod into earth and connected to unit. Open ground still indicated, but APC UPS proceeded to charge and there were no ground failure alarms.Called Buffalo Tools customer service (866) 460-9436 as directed in manual and was informed 'you can't use a circuit tester on these generators they have an open ground, that's how the low oil shut off works. The unit is fine.'I should have known better right then and there, but I proceeded to use the generator. After two days (approximately 10 hours of low load operation) my 26watt fluorescent drop lamp exploded behind my head. I immediately unplugged the lamp and went to the generator and tested the output at each of the outlets. They were both indicating 200 volts so I shut the unit down. I later discovered that three surge protectors with no connected load powered-up smoked and shorted out.There is no power gauge on the unit and the circuit protectors are a tragic accident waiting to happen. For the few seconds this power surged it was surprising how much smoke filled the house.I am experienced around this type of equipment and only heavy duty extension cords were used. Restarting the unit briefly I still measured 200 volts with my multimeter.IN MY OPINION THIS UNIT IS UNSAFE AND I WOULD NOT OPERATE IT LET ALONE RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!"
182624,2,"I bought this on Black Friday at Pep Boys 2011. I just stored it in on a shelf in my garage, and tried to use it about a month and a half later. I couldn't even assemble it! The quick-release air hose did not fit onto the nozzle. I took it back to Pep Boys. The associates couldn't even assemble it either, and they refused to exchange it or give me my money back.Bottom line, and words of wisdom to everyone on ALL products... Research the store's return policy and ensure that you try out the product before its exchange date passes!!!"
73152,1,This item is way stronger than expected. Works as advertised. It is strong enough to hold cargo jailer tight even if all the weight shifts side to side.
131718,1,"This switch works,which is most important. It was easy to install in the tight space of the box in the ceiling.I plan buying more to replace some of the old switches that suffer from irritating hesitation."
37427,1,I bought these for my 2005 scion xb show car and the matched perfect. They haven't faded because they are powder coated.I would buy again!!!!
17314,1,awesome product at a great price! K&N never lets me down. I was able to select ths based on dimensions for a custom application and it arrived qickly...
124834,1,"This was a gift to someone else, so I do not know how well it works, but it looks like it is in top condition."
9232,2,"I ordered the JNC660 from Amazon. After I opened the box, I found I cannot charge it via AC because the extension cord is not included. This seems a JNC600-specific cord and I cannot use other common power cord to replace it. So now I cannot use it until I find/order the necessary AC cord. I don't understand why the company does not include the extension cord for its product."
34278,2,This bag started peeling apart in the inside during our trip - ripped apart so much that we didn't even use it for the ride home.we didn't even let it outside over night and it could not hold up. spend the money and get a higher quality bag!!!
73662,1,this product is great for parking a car in the garage. Easy to install and see. i would recommend using additional heavy duty double sided tape to ensure it stays in place. Be sure to wipe down the concrete with alcohol to eliminate any oil residue on the concrete.
60002,1,"I liked these so much I bought a second set! I use them to decorate my magnetic white boards and they are so colorful and bright. I can't vouch for their application on a car or their ability to withstand rain, sleet, or snow. I would definitely recommend these magnets."
34755,0,"I had the same problem as one of the other reviewers. The blade itself is good and does it's job and it seems to be of good quality, but the blade slips out of the holding arm assembly to easily. I would recommend crimping the nubs that hold the blade on to the assembly and then using crazy glue to secure the blade before installation. This should work. Blade started slipping off after 3 months of use."
60158,0,"The spark plugs ran very well initially, but they only lasted 23,000 miles in my 2006 Silverado 5.3. They were the original plugs.The engine started misfiring after 23K miles so I replaced the plugs and wires. Went to Bosch +2's no problem."
172660,1,"Any Royal Purple products are gonna be the best for there application.this gun oil does a great job, and also doesn't cake up the guns when you fire many rounds.never have a jam or failure to eject...!!"
43321,2,"I thought this would be great, it looks good, feels soft and should be warm inside, but in order to attach to my Honda 300 Fourtrax with regular tubing handlebars, I can just barely get the velcro to close, at an awkward looking angle, and still there is a gap that lets air in the front.If that was it I would be fine with them, but where they make a right angle is right where my throttle is, tight fit, almost too tight to use with gloves which I need since the air comes through it as mentioned above. Then I find ice in between the supposed waterproof layer and the inner liner, so they got even colder, even though I have been careful to close them to keep snow from blowing into them, but in doing so, (not roughly) a tear developed on one side along the seam on the shell right near the hand entrance, after the ice developed inside."
68484,2,We have purchased two pairs of these seat covers and both of the ones we use the most (on the driver side of each car) have holes in the seam already. The pair we bought awhile back were added to my car last month and the pair I got for my boyfriend only last week both have significant holes and we're very disappointed.
25656,0,"About a work after having my car serviced I noticed the mechanic had failed to replace one of the valve caps. So, I purchased these. They are more expensive than what I could have gotten in the store, but they work great. They're made of sturdy plastic. The only downside - they are much more expensive than those you could get in the store. I have a bad hip so I don't really like walking around stores and was, therefore, willing to pay the extra cost."
63852,1,Very handy item could not beieve I waited so long to purchase it. Excellent shipper.
120374,1,Muy buen producto exelente entrega buen precio recomiendo al 100% altamaente conforme muchas Gracias...seguiremos comprando con ustedes el envio internacional exelente...
67493,2,"I got this part for my '97 Tahoe. It says it is for this vehicle. I double checked that just now. It arrived with the packaging intact but the wires were broken. It looks like someone dropped something sharp on the wires because all 3 of them have a large ding in the insulation that goes all the way to the wire itself. However, even the plastic bag the part is in is not damaged, so the damage had to be before it was put in the plastic bag. Since there was some undamaged wire left on the connector, I cut the bad part off and spliced it in with the shorter wires. They I went to plug it into the crank sensor and it would not plug in. The connector LOOKS the same, but upon closer scrutiny I found that the key is on the wrong side! This is NOT for my car, or it is manufactured wrong. I WENT THROUGH ALL THIS WORK FOR NOTHING! Now I had to cut the wires on my car's wiring harness even shorter to put the old connector back on and once I get a good connector I will have to cut them yet again!"
94347,0,Product did not include the stainless steel quick release clips listed in the product description. Spent a couple of extra bucks for this net over some other ones since it listed the quick release clips and the others didn't. Covercraft's web site is very clear that the quick release clips are optional. Otherwise this product was as expected and seems to be of decent quality.
90477,1,It fit just like the other side did I like it! I bought one for each side now I shop here often!
47015,0,"All in all I am happy with this sunshade, but it has quite a few cons.Pros: This sunshade really does a good job keeping the sun out, especially for the huge front window of the Honda Civic. I have a 2007 Civic Si and it fits pretty well. It is hard to find something that fits and within a reasonable price range. It also seems to be ok quality, so far.Cons: It is a bit of work to put it up and down. Ask your passenger to stay outside... It is quite stiff and you need to bend it a bit to fit under the rearview mirror (which moves out of place and you have to adjust afterwards). I also don't understand why they made the Velcro strap so short. It is really hard for a reasonably strong woman to roll it up and tie it together. As a third point, it is quite big to store. Your backseat passengers will have a stiff friend... And forget being 5 people in the car with this inside.You can't be in a rush and it is not worth putting it up for a 15 minute grocery store stop. However, I can't really find any better protection though. If you find one, let me know."
68462,1,"Excellent product. I changed the sheet metal screws to some hex head metal screws --worked better, switched the lock washers for lock nuts on the bolts. Installation was a snap. The product should say there are two steps included. I bought two sets and will have to sell one!"
144355,0,"It works, that is to say it swivels, and mover up and down. The problem is that the mechanism is really loose, and the trailer is able to shift back and forth easily. I would pass this one up and buy a better jack if it were me."
141907,1,"This is my third solar charger. The first, a Coleman, started rusting shortly after purchase. Warrantee says ""not for outdoor use"". What?? It's a solar charger for goodness sake. The second has held up but it is too small. This one is used to maintain batteries for my boat lift and it does a great job. Keeps the one it's attached to at about 13.20 volts. Has held up well and my next purchase will be a couple more of these."
126389,0,"The material of the plastic sheet is adequate, but I am dubious about how well it will stand up to winter use. The directions for assembly are not adequate, The ""how to assemble the edges are simply not detailed enough and it is very easy to not place the lock edges to close to the edge making it easy for them to slip off. The delivery time was several days slower than promised."
7377,2,"Returned inverter after total failure upon initial trial. Product defective right out of the box. Forced to pay for return shipping - then they deducted the initial shipping cost from the refund!! This is the second AIMS inverter that failed - the first one used maybe five times. They are 0 for 2 and I'm out a total of about $40 shipping. Their comment when I called about deducting the last shipping charge: ""It's only $20."" Now that's customer service. DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR PRODUCTS - RUN!!!!!"
104765,1,We have a 2007 Toyota 4Runner and got the WeatherTech to replace all of the floor mats. We are so happy we did; living in Colorado makes them a necessity and they are so easy to take out and hose off when necessary. The color matches perfectly and they fit like they were made for the truck. Thanks!
103876,1,It's a cutting board. It works like it should. Make sure you attach it to a stable wall area. We reinforced the wall the some backing board so that it was more stable in our RV.
157120,0,"If you go to the car wash, then this would be a great alternative. However, I did not like the fact that after washing the car and drying it, the finish of the car was not smooth. The one good thing about this product is the water filter, which I will continue to use with my regular soap instead."

175244,2,"This sensor is not a replacement for the factory speed sensor, nor can it be modified to be used in place of it. This is strictly an aftermarket part for non street vehicles using an actual speedometer cable. The return policy at Amazon.com is very limited (15 days) and by the time I figured all of this out it was too late to return it. Also, the part specifies it must be used with the Painless wiring harness for the fuel injection. Bottom line here is that if you are just trying to fix your street car it's worthless! Strictly for competition use is what my mechanic says! (Will not pass smog test either I'm told). Suggest you do not buy!!"

109031,2,"I dont really like how this product fits my NGK 7mm wires, it's just loose. I just took it off as soon as I put it on. It was a cheap product from a good-known quality manufacturer, so I think that it applies to ""you get what you pay for"".Quality-wise it just looks and feels cheap, no common from the previous protucts I've gotten from Moroso."
82841,1,"I bought two covers, just in case, because mines was stolen, they came in a timely fashion, fit well over the plugs, and you hardly know it's there, now that I am aware something so small is so valuable that it has to be stolen, I tied it down with black plastic electrical ties, so it's not so easy to remove, it's still there ;-)"
143,0,These hinge pins differ from the factory pins. The original equipment pins taper to a smaller diameter about the middle of the pin. These do not. I had to drill the top hole out for the pin to go through then I had to drill the holes for the bushings to fit but once everything was put together the new pin and bushings work great. No more door sag and also eliminated the wind noise around the front seal.
68155,1,"This is General Motors part number 90512510 or AC Delco part number 15-80845. After reading several Saab blogs when my blower motor continued to blow even with the car turned off, I learned it was possibly due to a faulty blower motor resistor. I searched part 90512510 and came across the first reviewer in Amazon who said this part worked for his Saab even though it appears to have been designated for certain Cadillac models. Amazon had the best price so I ordered it. Took me about an hour to install. See attached pictures. The hardest part was disconnecting the electrical plug (orange/black wire) from the resistor. But, the new resistor fixed the problem. (I think I blew the old resistor on a very cold day by jumping into my car and jacking up the fan speed to the highest speed too fast.)"
63169,1,I have been putting these Throttle Body Spacer's in all my car's and truck's. This spacer for the dodge 4.7 L engine made a huge difference more power and better mpg. This specific Throttle Body Spacer was for the 4.7 L with the plastic air intake manifold so before you order take a look to see which one you have.
156579,0,I purchased this a month ago. I have always been satisfied with Bosch wipers. And this pair works just as great. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars only is that the connector is quite a big and it looks like nipples on my windshield.
148861,0,"It is a very practical and functional, the material is of good quality, and can be used in a variety of vehicles, and also at a great price"
128192,1,i ordered this product because i had a fault code. it told me what the fault was and i cleared it and its good to go. Sometimes vehicles gives out faults when there are none. i recommend this for the people how want to know what the codes are.
36209,0,"I bought this unit and used it once in my work van to charge batteries for my cordless drill. It worked great. I then stored it on a shelf in the back of the van. When I tried to use it again, it blew the fuse to the Cigarette lighter of the van. For the $20.00 that I spent on it, it just wasn't worth going throught the hassle of the Warranty, so I took the cover off of the unit and noticed that a screw holding an electronic power regulator had come loose and fallen out, allowing the regulator to short directly to the chassis of the unit. I re-inserted the screw and insolated the power regulator and the unit works just fine again. (I added a droplet of Locktite to prevent the screw from loosening again) All-in-All, this unit does everything that I expected it to do. Fortunately, I knew enough to be able to fix it myself. Unfortunately, This is just another example of the ""Mass-Produced"" crap, that we have to live with, every day of our lives. How sad...........What ever happened to ""QUALITY"" products!!!!!"
164383,0,"I bought this cushion to help alleviate soreness I feel in my butt during 2+ hour car trips. The cushion is more comfortable than a regular seat, but the long car trips still cause discomfort for me. The cushion is about 2-3 inches thick, so it elevates you quite a bit. If you use in the car and you have big legs, it may cause your thighs to hit the bottom of the steering wheel."
96238,1,"These higway pegs are great. I am 6'5"" tall, so most highway pegs are to close for me. These are fully adjustable so someone my height can be comfortable. But also, they can be extended out for an even taller person, or brought in for a shorter person. They certainly do not come cheap, but from everything else I have experience with, these are worth every penny."
183144,1,I LOVE Sabrina Jewelry and have been buying from them for a while. Prices are reasonable and I love them!
147541,1,"Purchased two of these to replace broken mirrors. Looks just like the original and is easy to install once you figure out how to remove the interior door panel. Just three bolts holding it on and it comes with a new styrofoam gasket. Save the bolt nuts from the old mirror as new ones are not supplied. As someone noted, there is a slight low whistle at certain speeds due to aerodynamics, but its not that bad."
101411,1,"I have tried many of the products on the market, but this has been the best of all the ones I have used. Trust me, I have use the Turtle Wax, Armour All, Black Magic and many of the other competitors. Doesn't disturb the wax and unlike people using dish soap, doesn't strip the wax and dull the clear coat. Simply the best if you like your car or truck."

71166,0,The box had been opened and retaped with no visible damage to the box but the tube was bent at the end. Had to pound out the dent to insert the parts but it worked well once I fixed it.
81617,0,"I bought this Hopkins Level primarily because it had a good appearance and the price was right. However, it is not very repeatable and has a tendency for the ball to hang, giving a false reading. It is still useful, by tapping lightly on the frame I can get a usable reading. However, I wish I had spent a little more and bought a better level.After several months of use, the level is working better. The ball doesn't seem to hang as much and it is reasonably accurate when checked against my 4ft standard level.An update 8/30/09. After over a year of trying, I'm giving up on this level and ordering a Camco 25563 RV AccuLevel. I'm tired of wondering if the level ball is stuck or is giving a correct reading. At times I think it is reading correctly, then the ball slowly moves to a new position!"
61567,1,"I am up-changing my review; partial, below.It was used primarily for maintaining a battery and after a year of varied home use, is dead. I expect Swedish products to be premium quality.I went to ctek's site and found two company officers names and -email addys. I wrote of my displeasure and both.. BOTH, answered within hours, with one sending his telephone # for me to call.The net? I sent my 7000 back to them and got a brand new 7002. I was told the failure rate is so low on these that the warranty has been extended from 2 to 5 years.I find this a refreshingly positive level of product support and far above what has become the norm."
129696,2,I have used a lot of floor jacks before and this is not a good product. It could hardly jack up on end of my Ford Ranger than after 20 or so uses the seals went out and now it is useless!
4199,1,"i wanted to replace a front plate on my recently acquired vehicle and found this one. I do love cats and i liked the plate design. it arrived on time, very well packaged for shipping and was in perfect shape. Very easy to put on my vehicle. There are lots of vehicle identical to mine and this plate makes mine a little more unique. Love the plate."
46412,0,"Just installed. This new Beck Arnley rotor for the REAR wheels is missing two small threaded holes that are on the original rotors (pictured on competitive rotors) and were essential for pulling/removing the old rotors. If I didn't need the new ones now, I would have considered returning and exchanging for another mfr.. First set of rotors survived 125K miles of New Hampshire winters; hopefully these replacements will outlive the car and won't need to be replaced. If you drive aggessively and anticipate replacement, consider another manufacturer.The Beck Arnley FRONT rotors do have these threaded holes; why on the fronts and not on the rears?Unrelated to rotors but important: Amazon processing and free shipping perfect."
45816,1,I prefer this to my rental tool from autozone. The rental tool from autozone is a vacumm pump. I'll be honest. This device and a pal pumping on the brake did a better job.
103782,0,"My defroster tab was not working and I did not want to pay unnecessary money to stick the tab back on. I went to the dealership and they charged me $40 to stick it back on using this same product. Well it didn't last long so I decided to purchase the product myself for a fraction of the cost. The product came in a timely manner and was definitely cheaper than what the dealership charged me but after following the directions, it didn't stick. I can't say if it's worth buying because it didn't work for me, at least but then again it may have been user error but it's worth trying first."
173639,0,"This alarm really isn't as loud as I had hoped. I was hoping it would be as loud as a good smoke alarm, which it is not. I could not hear it go off from down the hall with my air conditioner on.I also wish there was a sturdier option than the double stick tape."
152452,0,"I bought the Pavement Ends top only to replace my current BestTop top and needed the most inexpensive one I could find because I was solely going for the immediate aesthetic quality for I was selling my Jeep.When comparing the quality of the product to my existing one, I did notice a big difference between weight and consequently construction. There was nothing wrong as far as any defects would go, but it was obvious that this product was very thin and flimsy. In case of the soft top, flimsy is good, but this top felt very thin.When I initially began the installation I relied solely on the instructions because I had not replaced it before. I was going in blind so to speak. I will say that the instructions related the information necessary to correctly install it, with as little trouble as possible, very precisely and easy to follow. The only part of the description that required more in depth elucidation on my part was the installation of the top (hood). It did not picture or describe very well the exact position and procedure to insert it and roll over. You will figure it out eventually by process of elimination, but my advice would be to document or take pictures of the existing top as you are taking it off. After that the hardest part was replacing the soft windows (aren't they always), but the whole process was not that bad.SUMMARY:Tools required:1. Screwdriver2. Sharp object (to make 2 holes) such as a razor blade or knifeDifficulty : 4/10Things I liked about the product:1. Looks good on the Jeep.2. Has greater shine because of a different type of plastic then the more expensive ones.3. Fairly easy installation4. Of course the price.Things I didn't like:1. Poor quality. It was very thin. I suspect it wouldn't last very long.2. As explained above, the installation of the soft roof could use more delineation.My suggestion would be that if you are planning on keeping the Jeep for a while then certainly invest more in a better top.If you, however, are like me and are planning on selling it or sprucing it up temporarily, then buy this top."
146325,1,came right on time and just peel and attach. The window visors were very easy to install. Just needed to align them and they fit like a charm.
170640,0,I purchased this product as a replacement for the other Electromate 400 that has the air compressor that I like a lot. I thought the radio was in addition to that feature. I found that the radio replaces the compressor and for me that was not a good trade off. I will be keeping the Electromate 400 with the air compressor and giving this one away as a christmas gift.
4290,1,"Powersport Superstore, politely informed of the delivery date, and I recieved this tool on time. It's a well made thin-walled socket as advertised. Although this socket truly is a thinwalled socket, I needed to grind down the wall thickness even more to make it fit my 98' KLR 250. My reground wall thickness is now under 1 mm at the lower 1/2"" of this socket... which is scary, and makes me wonder why ANY bike munufacture would purposely design the spark plug access tolerance that close.This product is designed to fit the Honda, and most likely will fit that bike's spark plug well, but don't expect a miracle if you plan to use this socket on a KLR 250."
88282,0,"I wanted this mainly for securing plywood sheets and other long home improvement items. It is very easy to attach and detach; and seemed to stay in one place pretty well. There are four hooks that sit between the door and the car frame attached with nylon straps. If you are not going very long distances, I think this is a good buy, but for particulary long trips I would want something attached more permanently.As far as the universal fit: it fits well on my 1997 Sentra, but I could not put it on my 2007 Mazda3 [maybe you can, but I couldn't figure out a safe place for the clips to engage].It does make a bit of a whistling noise, but because it is easy to install and remove, this isn't much of an issue."
114779,1,I just used this bag to hold my family's clothing on a visit to family for the holidays. The bag held four large duffels with two smaller bags that carried personal care items. Three winter coats were packed in there as well.The Rola bag expands to hold plenty of gear. I mounted the bag on a Harbor Freight Aluminum hitch rack and it fit PERFECT! I gave this four stars because it doesnt look like the picture. Bag is made of a rubber coated nylon material that appears waterproof but is not aesthetically pleasing. In cold weather the material stiffens up and the zippers have a hard time doing their thing. The six sraps held firmly and there was no danger of the bag coming loose. Unlike other bags this one is waterproof but if the exterior were a regular material as pictured it would look nicer but this is easy to clean as well. Get this bag if you have a hitch basket!
115938,1,"I waited a month to get this from Amazon but it was worth it. This is a precision machine, well engineered and a pleasure to work with. If you are someone who takes pride in having good tools and knowing how to use them, this is one of those premium products that will make others envious. The instructions were good, all the parts were there. It will take you about 1-1/2 to 2 hours to assemble. My Hitachi 10&quot; fit perfectly on it. There are cheaper stands out there, none as nice."
149985,1,this is the same filter as you local auto store. it is not anything special but does the job for your everyday vehicle.
155432,0,"This roof vent is a replacement of the Maxxair vent that finally fractured after 14 years. I was able to use the originally installed brackets and hardware. That meade for a very quick installation.The #1 reason for having a vent like this is to keep rain out. I fully expect that it will. The #2 reason is to allow ventilation. This unit has a louver panel that can be removed for cleaning. That is nice, but it also has a bug screen imbedded in the plastic. Since we leave the original vent opening screen in place, the new one is redundant. Anyway, the Camco vent cover really won't keep bugs out since there are access openings around the base. So, why is the non-removeable screen there? Are they needed to keep rain that bounces off of the roof from getting in? If I carefully cut the screen away, will water still get in? This screen will seriously reduce the vent air flow. The Maxxair vent has a removeable screen. I miss that. Next replacement will be another Maxxair vent or the Camping World one that has some side ventilation that greatly increases side air flow in or out."
107095,2,"I ordered this believing it was the whole Oxygen Sensor,but it's just the connector. $30 for it, is about the same price as a lot of complete Sensors. An outrageous price for just a connector. I'm a professional mechanic, & in all my many years, I've never needed just a connector, & at that price, why would you not get the whole unit,& save the hassle of swapping the wires out. Oxygen Sensor should be replaced as a maintenance item every 2-4 years depending on how many miles you drive, for better performance,& cleaner emissions. Yukon Garry"
34911,1,this seat fits perfectly. it has considerable more padding that will make a long ride worth doing. the passenger seat is really comfortable for my wife. the beads and conchos match my saddlebags. great seat!
13348,1,I liked the heaviness of the materials used. The installation hardware was terrific. The handle included was a nice deal.
66265,0,"The biggest disappointment was the fabric wasn't really what I had expected, the fit at the rear window area doesn't fit all that tight (I have a 06 Mustang convertible).The cover will work but I wouldn't order it again, you might be happy with one but I'm just o.k with it.The question is why didn't I return it, the simple answer is, it is what it is and I should have done my home work better....not the fault of the company."
4694,0,"This product does what it said it would but not consistently.You can read up on all the reviews about how features and stuff. I will instead focus on usability.I have this hooked up to a 03 towncar Sig. It will function ok for reading and resetting ECL. But for everyday use (displaying the gauges, such as rpm, voltage, and other item etc.) the unit will freeze. Gets stuck in ""connecting!"" message when you try to re-connect. When it is connected and showing the gauges, display will turn itself off and you have to keep turning it back on to see it.I guess its still good enough. But the extra $ it cost is not worth it for me.I'm ebaying it since return period is over :-(.Wish you all good luck if you decided to get it."
159377,1,I bought this for my 2011 BMW G650GS and have no complaints. The installation was smooth and everything fit as it should. Don't forget to install the foam restrictor if you're not going to get a custom tune! It's nice that this was thought of and included.
10910,0,Well made product. The colonial white is not a very pleasant color. Photos for this product make it appear to be a shade of tan and don't represent the actual color which is an ugly shade of yellow. I would not buy this color again and wish I had selected the white color instead.

158232,0,"Purchased this item last week, for my Hurricane kit. The last hurricane we had knocked out power for eight days. And our supply of batteries was depleted after a few days. Using a gas powered generator in an apartment community is risky at best due to the chance of theft, so this is a viable alternative for short term use. Shipping and packaging was excellent.Manufactured Date of my unit is 31 August 2010. You can find the date by opening up the storage compartment lid, and looking to the raised platform on the right side. After charging for the recommended 15 hours, I plugged in one 20 inch box fan 120V 60Hz, .075Am. The unit ran for 8 hours of continuous use until the low battery alarm sounded. Word to the wise, the alarm is quite loud, as it ticked off my GSD enough for him to howl.Don't know if this is good or bad for this particular unit, but eight hours seems to be a fairly good amount of usage for a normal outage. Will test it using a lamp with a 23w CFC and the fan and report back later. If anyone has experience with this unit and would like to share expected usage times, please comment. Thanks"

136828,0,"I bought this tool at the auto store for about $10 more than Amazon's price. If the store had it or I was willing to wait, I would have bought the die cast metal version with the guage because I tend not to skimp on tools. This plastic tool turned out to be perfectly suitable for my two jobs: completely flush and replace the brake fluid for a late model GM full size pickup, and suck out all the power steering fluid from the same so I could replace that as well. A service shop would have charged me at least an hour labor for those jobs and this tool cost substantially less than that. It was worth it even if I threw it away upon completion, but I'll keep it somewhere in the bottom of the toolbox for when I need to do a job like this again a few years from now. It worked fine this time, and it will probably work fine then too.For just bleeding, the tool is just right. For a complete fluid replacement, the reservoir is a little small. It holds 4 oz whereas I must have flushed about 64 oz of brake fluid from the whole system (had to empty the bottle about 4 times per wheel). I also sucked out about half a quart of power steering fluid which took emptying the bottle a few times as well. There are larger capacity tools for these jobs but they cost more. They would certainly be worth it if I did this kind of work often, but I just don't.Update: I've done more bleed and flush jobs with this since my review and I find the vacuum thing to be mostly worthless. Maybe it's the ABS circuits or whatever but suction just doesn't do the job. The only part that's useful is the little container that holds the tube under the fluid and has a lid with an outlet so it doesn't spill. Still, the bottle is too small. Next job I'm just going to use a tube and big jar with a lid and two holes."
128316,1,"I own a 2004 Ducati Multistrada 1000DS which I bought new. The bike came with these wide straight handlebars that really hurt my elbows for some reason.Ducati put out a whole catalog of accessories for the Multistrada; over priced do-dads, carbon fiber this and that, etc. You can purchase 2 types of carbon fiber wheels for the bike, but do you think Ducati or their deals would sell different handlebars? No way.These Daytona handle bars made by BikeMaster look exactly like the OEM Bars but are about an inch narrower and are pulled back about an inch and a half. The difference for me was like night and day!!! Best of all the first Daytona handle bars I bought were about $16.00; NOTHING from the Ducati Dealer is $16.I'm back for another set of Bike master bars due to a little mishap. I think the handle bars were $19.00 now; a bargain!BikeMaster Daytona handlebars are awesome!"

I also noticed that the name of the company wasn't displayed however the words ""Conduct Tite!"" (Yes, with an exclamation)on the lower part. I should have simply put it back in the package and returned it at that point. I found what I thought would be detailed directions explaining the technical mystery of filling the fuel reservior. It turned out to be a crude diagram fit for a cave painting without a word on it. Upon inspection of the hieroglyphic type diagram, I determined that you must open the torch by pulling the top part which houses the trigger and flame outlet, from the bottom part. Inside, I found essentially a cheap, two for a dollar lighter without the top flint wheel. Before losing it altogether, I decided to fill the cheap lighter, put the torch back together and see if my assumption was wrong. Click! Click! Nothing. There is no adjustment lever or slide to increase air or fuel flow. The only adjustable device is the cheap lighter which still had the slide in the front to turn up the flame. A small hole is located to access the the slide but wasn't aligned and thereby leaving the slide below the hole which made it useless while still in the housing. My last attempt was to hold a flame to the torch outlet to see if it would light and if so I could say that the problem was simply a spark issue. I figured it may still do the job. I got a flame but nothing close to what one would expect from a torch. The worst part is that upon releasing the trigger, it remained lit for almost a minute. Altogether, not only does this product fail to create a spark and a torch flame but it failed to extinguish a flame when expected. Upon completion of the review, I will be contacting Amazon directly and the US Consumer Safety Comission. I'm surprised that this product is sold in the US."

Maybe you can fabricate a bracket to make it fit, good luck and good bye.""Completely unacceptable.Update: I changed the rating from 1 star to 3.

71312,1,This car top carrier worked easily and perfectly on a recent 2000 mile trip. It is easy to put on and take off the roof and has large zipper flaps to keep the weather out. We did not experience any heavy rain so its ability to be waterproof is an unknown to us. It did keep heavy dew off things though and light rain. Gas mileage was off about 20% though but we had to pack it as full as possible so there wasn't anything aerodynamic about it. I would definitely recommend this product.
32564,1,"This thing is the bomb! I got lucky when I chose this polisher. It was a gift for my husband. He says it is the best one he has ever used. I, being an older female wimp, found it to be a tad heavy. Would make for a good workout for me. Does a very professional job at a nominal price."

I usually have oil grease, gasoline and dirt all over my hands and even up my arms where I rested my elbow on the side of the tractor. Trying to get that stuff off with soap and water is useless. But GOJO gets the job done!GOJO contains no harsh solvents but it cuts right through the grease, oil, dirt and tar. It cleans with or without water and leaves behind a natural citrus scent that gets rid of the oil and gas smell. It will even clean under your fingernails and get the oil stains out of the creases in your hand. I don't mean scrubbing hard, it just comes off! The natural pumice scrubbers in the product scour your hands clean while the orange citrus ingredients cut through the greasy mess. This stuff is a miracle cleaner. I have a tub sitting beside my garage sink for the heavy duty cleaning.If you work on engines or in the garage a lot then this cleaner is made for you!"
79707,0,"I ordered this product because they were sold out in all the local stores and I desperately needed a wiper blade. However, when I recieved the blade, the package beat up and ultimately the wiper blade was bend and not useable. I know I could have contacted Amazon and they would have taken care of it. (They are good about that stuff.) But I didn't want to wait for another one in the mail. I ended up buying one at the local WalMart. The wiper blade's performance is good. I live in the south and we don't get much rain, so I don't see the point in buying really expensive wiper blades. This one gets the job done at a reasonable price."
3127,0,"buyers, listen up! The grille insert in the picture is not the same as what you'll get. I bought this product for my xlt f-150 because amazon said it would fit. I didn't see the small print, because doing alot of research on the product tends to make your senses a little more careless, where the actual seller has it's own product fitment link. Make sure you check that out because for some reason they have the full honeycomb style grille picture as to what is being sold and in reality, you're getting a different looking product that is cut to fit the bar style grilles commonly found on the fx4 model f150. That version of the inferno look is not the same as what's shown in the pictures for this product so make sure you're getting what you want before you buy it. I returned it immediately and bought the correct model for my xlt which is PUTCO 89142 made to fit the full honeycomb grille. Other than that, I love putco products and I recommend them."
141804,0,I recently ordered one of these panels (June 2007). The first one arrived shattered - the manufacturer packaging does not protect the panel much and it was inadequately packaged in the shipping box by Amazon. The replacement unit was also badly packaged for shipment.I tested the electrical output in full sunlight and got 20V out into a 100 ohm load -> 4 watts which is pretty good.One thing to consider though is that this product is not very rugged. The solar panel has a plastic frame but the middle is unprotected on the back (and front). So unless you handle it very carefully it is likely to break.Someone using this on a car dashboard would need some sort of protective carrier (like those insulated pizza boxes) to protect the unit when it was not being used.------------ Update Dec 2007 ----------------Panel stopped producing electricity in November. Had to send it in to Sunforce at my expense for warrantee replacement. They promptly tested it and sent me a replacement. One thing I did notice is that the plastic housing on the unit that I returned had developed some small cracks. I am using the unit on my car dashboard to keep my battery charged.

73546,0,"I've owned many sunshades over the years and this one is not bad. Three stars is probably a little harsh, but I have my reasons.First the good news. While the Heatshield appears to be made of similar materials as are used in the $10 shades you can buy at the local store, it is a custom fit, and it certainly does a good job of keeping sunlight and heat out of my truck.The bad news is that it's such a tight fit that putting it up and down can be a bit tricky and time consuming. I mean this thing is really wedged in there. For me it's great because this is being used in a weekend truck, and I don't have to take it down often. But for most people, I think the hassle of fitting it into position is going to ensure that the Heatshield lives mostly in the trunk. Additionally, its large size makes rolling it up tight enough to store a bit harder than it should be.I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the price. I actually like the product a lot. It works for me and I plan to have it for many years. I just can't figure why it has to cost so much. And don't get me wrong I have spent over 50 dollars for premium shades before, but in those cases you could see the value in the materials used. The Heatshield would be a great value at $20."

160014,0,This part fit perfectly. I do not like people who leave low star numbers and rave about the product. However the regulator fit perfectly on my 1997 Ford Crown Victoria.It has to be a known fact as I have replaced three of these that Ford used rivits to hold the window to the regulator and the bottom of the regulator to the door. This kit does not come with new rivits or bolts.I personally used bolts as rivits are mostly for manufactures to save cost. This part however should come with four bolts to replace the drilled out rivits. It would not cost much more and would make it faster to replace.
175397,0,The claim that this battery fits a Prius is a little misleading. It will go into the space but the posts are too large for the clamps from the Prius. This requires you to search for after market clamps (not in a small town) or file the posts down which probably voids the warranty. I should have spent the$20 extra and bought from a company that offers the needed clamps with the battery. The battery is in and works gone but I am quite concerned that the expected life may be shortened. The battery packaging left a lot tobe desired as well.
74198,0,"This visor-extender is a good idea, but the two problems I found in MY sample were very distressing. The Darker of the two pieces slides smoothly and easily, but it does NOT ever disappear- you are forced to see it at all times. It should be either removable, or at least flippable to reduce the distraction. The second problem, possibly just in MY sample, is the severe distortion in the plastic. The waviness was very distracting, almost hiding smaller items in the line of sight. I hope the rest of the stock is of a better Optical quality, to soothe the eyes and to protect the driver from the glare and brightness that tends to attack the eyes and the driver's brain!"

So custom fit for the year, make and model of my truck that it has cut outs so that the mirror mounted turn signals are visible with the towing mirrors attached. Great buy for the price, lightning fast shipping, a very satisfied customer."

49067,0,"I could have pulled too hard, but seriously - the straps should not be THAT weak! First time using it and one of the clips broke apart when I tightened it. Other than that, it worked fine for us. Part of the trip was rainy, but our stuff (two sleeping bags, medium cooler, pillows, blanket, tent, two camping chairs, and a few other random items) stayed dry and secure. I tied down the extra strapping, and didn't notice any flapping sound whatsoever. Overall I'd give it a 4-4.5, but with the broken clip I have to dock it a bit. Definitely worth the price, though... Can't argue that!"
5471,0,"I have had these bulbs in my 1992 Corsica for about 2 years now. I have tried almost every bulb out there to give that HID blue look and these are by far, the best. One thing I do like about them, is that they have lasted me for 2 years and are still working, unlike other bulbs which die out in less then a year.But there is one flaw and it's a biggie. Even though they look cool, they are a dim looking bulb. They are great for show or driving in the city where everything is lit up with street lights, but if you have to drive in the country or a dark street, you can't see very well with these bulbs. They have never been a bright bulb.So if you want that blue look and want bulbs that last, these are your guys, but if you want to be able to see at night while you drive, stay away from these :)"
25100,0,"The manual is confusing and poorly printed. But, like computer modems, manuals for scan tools can be sort of generic, at least so far as the devices have similar innards. The ""Digital OBDII Code Reader Manual"" on the website of the Open Source Software House is 102 pages (about half being code definitions) and looks to be more useful, although I haven't studied it yet. Others may be even better.One of the virtues of the 9135 is that I was able to plug it in, read the codes and clear them after getting no farther than page 2 in the Actron book.It may be that the main difference between the costly readers and the less costly ones lies in the reference material provided in the package, with the consumer-grade models being the most cryptic.This tool is by no means all you need to work on late model cars, but it is certainly a necessity."

You would think the product would be OK for $40.00 dollars, but this product is simply junk. I should have listened to the other reviews before purchasing. The fan is unnervingly loud and sounds like a poorly built electric weed eater....fresh out of the box, and it sounds like it's falling apart. The heat output is slim to none, and even so, it's built-in thermal sensor turns the unit off after 5 minutes...I could go on and on, so just do yourself a favor and save your money!"

103666,1,"I originally had a AEM intake system but the dryflow filter seemed more like the paper filters due to having to constantly clean them. I decided to switch to the K&N, and i should have bought K&N to begin with, this filter will fit any intake with the diameter specified for tahoe, I used this filter on the stock AEM chrome tubing and fits wonderful, actually better. The airflow is way better over AEM, because it does allow more air through. Some say to hold filter up to the light and you'll see ""holes"", well true but very small. In my opinion this allows for better air flow and anyway have you seen the factory intake and the gaps where crap can come in!! If your wanting to filter to micron then stick to paper filters i guess, which are useless, if you want more air then go with K&N, nothing better. For intake tubing go with aluminum, and stay away from plastic, any BRAND!"
188362,1,"2012-03-17I bought my Keychain LifeHammer about a year ago thinking that I'd never have to use it, but this morning while out driving I was first on the scene of a serious two-car accident. There were, thankfully, no deaths, but there were serious injuries and two guys trapped in the front and back passenger-side seats of a four-door sedan. They were pretty busted up and couldn't think well enough to unlock their doors so we could get into them. So, I went through the windows with the LifeHammer and, with a few others that stopped, helped to calm them and check for life threatening wounds. Thankfully, they're going to be okay. I was much more than pleased how the LifeHammer let me take deliberate and positive action to get to someone in trouble."

14897,1,This is by far the best ever. No streaks and is very good at getting those bumps of what ever off with out blurry streaking afterwards. I use it on almost everything that needs a good cleaning. Stainless is fabulous with this product.
140007,1,"This works great on all surfaces - paint, trim, plastic, metal, door seals, headlights, windows, chrome, wheels, tires. Don't use on glass that's been treated withAquapel Glass Treatment- it's harder to remove, but not a big deal, just useSprayway Glass Cleanerto clean the glass. You can use Ice Polish instead of Aquapel or RainX. Ice polish does clean a little, but it's more of a wax than a polish. Like others have said, this feels like baby oil and spreads very easy over the car. I use too much and pretty much slop it on to move quickly, but that hasn't been a problem, just takes a few more microfiber cloths to remove it. I've also left it on too long (over an hour, instructions say 5-10 minutes) but that's not a problem, it's never dried on me and just a little more effort to wipe off. I bought this because I wanted to keep my car waxed, but didn't want to spend alot of time and effort doing it. In the past I used Nu-Finsh and liked the results, but if you got Nu-Finish on black trim, it's was a pain to remove. I never want to go back to that level of hassle and effort. I'm super happy to say Ice lives up to the promise of working on black trim. It really make the trim and tires shine. The like the shine and ""slickery"" feel it leaves on my new white Nissan. Not sure how long it lasts, but it's so easy to apply and remove that it's no big deal to use it more often. Ice does not not leave a ""hard"" feel on the paint as do traditional waxes. My cloth rags don't slide off the an Ice wax job as easily. Not sure if that means anything though. I've also used Turtle Wax Ice spray wax, but don't feel it's necessary. Ice polish seems to have more of the active ingredient than the spray wax and since the polish is so easy to use, there's no reason to use the spray wax. The nature of this product seems to be revealed when you squeeze the soaked foam applicator in you hand, it has the consistency of sticky mucous (sorry to get gross) and I think that's what's left on the car after the application. This ""residue"" does not wash off my hand or the applicator easily, which is probably a good thing since if it came off easily, it would probably come off the car easily. I'm very happy with this product!"
167813,0,I purchased this PCV valve for a Saturn SC2 2002. The only complaint that I have is that it should have come with a plastic PCV elbow.

1752,0,I had read some reviews for carnauba wax and it had really good ratings. I purchased this Kit wax thinking it would be the same. Though it did make my car look clean it does not repell water and it does not give that slick feeling you get after waxing. I give it three stars because it could be so much more but isnt.
42377,0,"Installed about a week ago, and used it for the first time today. It's doing it's job great, but squeaking very loudly. I'm hoping the squeak goes away eventually."
81302,1,"Using Lexol is a great way of keeping car seats, sofas, chairs and other leather items moisturized to avoid cracking and color fade"
92712,2,I bought this based on the reviews. I was replacing a CP impact wrench and was considering an IR thundergun. Then I found this Aircat 1000 with 1000 ftlbs of reverse torque at about $60 less. My CP has only 450. This does not have much more. I started with my lightweight air hose that i use with nail guns and 90lbs of pressure on my compressor. It wouldn't losen the lug nuts on my one ton pickup...so..I went to a bigger air hose and increased the air pressure to 120lbs psi. Then it seemed to have more torque than my CP version but nothing special and clearly no where near twice as much. I should have sent it back but now it has been used. I am very disappointed
119742,0,"Champion (71) RC12YC Traditional Spark Plug, Pack of 1I ordered (8) Champion RC12YC spark plugs and received (6) and (2) with different numbers. Wasn't worth the expense to send two back for an exchange so bought a couple more at a local parts house."
59480,0,I bought the marvel mystery oil because of the positive reviews. I have to admit that I'm not that impressed by those claims made in previous reviews.
19467,0,"I bought one of the last of the available BBR skid plates (gold) for my '04 CRF 150F. Chose it over others (Works Connection, Flatland Racing, Moose, etc.) because of BBR's reputation, price (got it on sale), color, and because it looked like it would cover the lower frame tubes better than the Works Connection plate, which was my second alternative. The plate looks good-plenty durable and well-made, covers the tubes and underbelly just fine. It was fairly easy to install but I do think BBR should have included instructions for installation, even though it's pretty easy to figure out how the rear clips go. Instructions would have saved just a bit of time and initial confusion over how to get the clips in the right position.My only real problem with this plate is that the contour/bend doesn't match the bend of the bottom tubes of the frame very well so there is a 1/4"" gap between the plate and the lower front of the frame-not cool. lt may be that the gap allows a margin for clearance around welds that might have made a closer-fitting plate have fit issues-I don't know. But a 1/4"" gap is way too much, in any case. Pics of the Works Connection plate show a very nice tight fit with the frame tubes. Had I known that the plate would have this fit issue, I'd have bought the similar and lower-priced Works Connection plate. As it is, I think the BBR plate will work fine and I'm ok with it. This problem might not be there with the plate for the 06 and newer CRFs, which is a different (but similar) model than the one I got for my older CRF.I'd recommend consideration for the Works Connection plate and the Flatland Racing plate. The WC plate is less costly, as I said, and the FR plate has some cool-looking side ""wings"" that protect the casings where they extend outside the lower frame tubes. The FR plate costs about the same as the BBR plate."
112529,1,Does exactly what it's supposed to - heavier duty than most. Good and recommended.
124749,1,KYB AGX are not only a direct replacement for all 93-2001 Subaru Imprezas but they are one of the best struts you can buy for overall performance and ride quality. Buy these before you waste your money on expensive coil-overs that will make your daily driver a miserable experience to drive! I have used these on more than one car with the same excellent results!
49305,0,"I drove between Chicago & Seattle for school and used this cargo bag to carry mostly clothes & towels. Traveling during the winter months on the first leg of the trip, I ran into rain, sleet, & snow, but the bag stayed strapped & my things stayed dry. When I arrived, I unloaded, dried, folded, & stored it in a closet. A few months later on the return trip in the summer, I ran into some pretty average rain and the bag let in a little water. Normal wear & tear in the material appeared to be the cause, especially around the area where the straps tightly held the bag down. But I'd rather have my cargo bag wear a little than have my personal belongings dangerously scattered along a stretch of highway.For the price, it was a great deal & a good cargo bag while it lasted. Not sure how it compares to other soft cargo carriers, but it functioned perfectly one way & sufficiently on the return trip. I even suppose it MAY have been reparable (I junked it, unfortunately). Nevertheless, it didn't last very long without issue. I suppose at this point there have been enough reviews confirming that the bag may leak so consider yourself warned: THE CARGO BAG MATERIAL DOES WEAR & IT MAY LET IN WATER.For me, the bag was worth it b/c it lasted long enough, and I wasn't carrying anything sensitive to the elements in it. Hope this helps you a little when choosing a rooftop cargo carrier that fits your needs, expectations, & wallet."
59606,0,It look good but de quality is cheap! But price is good for the quality.
58389,1,Put these in the back of my Suby. Good fit and awesome performance with new standard rotors. Great initial bite and good pedal feel with great progressive braking.
35939,1,"Just washed the car using this for the first time, wow. The ability to get into the cracks and detail of the wheel makes a huge improvement in the detailing and overall look of the clean car. Bonus is to be able to also clean the often overlooked wheel wells. Highly recommended."
174151,0,The product is ok as far as being useful for what it was intended but it isn't any good if I have to wait 1.5 weeks to get it. This didn't come from Amazon's warehouse so I can't blame them but they should sell products from companies that process orders as quickly as they do. This item showed to be in stock from the beginning so there is no reason it should take over a week to be processed and shipped. Will avoid items supplied by this Non-Amazon company in the future.
162692,1,I bought this to replace my old and worn out belt. It was cheaper on amazon then any local part stores even with shipping. It's also a gatorback so it will last for a good period of time
151363,1,"I'm glad I opted to spend a little more than those other cargo bars because this one is beefy! I measured my bed and although this model (4016) is labeled for full size trucks, it works fine in my 2002 Toyota Tacoma DoubleCab! I'm glad it does fit width-wise because at full extension it will also fit length-wise. I did purchase the stabilizer bar (4017) since I do have cargo that moves side to side and those are beefy too! I didn't think they would be worth $16, but I rescind that thought. One last thing, although the description refers to this as a ratchet mechanism, beware that it is not. It is actually a cam-lever mechanism, so when adjusting to size of bed, you must be aware that you can actually bow your bed walls. Again, this cargo bar is very hefty, so care must be taken in figuring the right length to lock in your bar. Otherwise, it will push farther then your bed walls which will damage your truck. Some might view that as a negative design, but I actually believe that's a positve design because the locking mechanism is very well made, and the bar is also very well made. The steel is thick gauge and the bar itself is thicker than some steel pipe. But with confidence!"
93807,1,"This fit perfectly in my Mitsubishi Mirage 1998, and i have had it one for about a week with no problems at all! It is a great price as well! the only reason i gave it a 4 star is because the sticky stuff that is supposed to stick to the holder wasn't very good. i would recommend buying some better glue and using that!Overall i would buy this again!"
119186,1,"I have bought about four different tire inflators over the years (Viair and Slime among them). This was one of my first purchases of a portable inflator. It works fine, but it is slow to inflate and is very loud. The good thing about this inflator is that it does not blow the fuse in my car when I am using it. The more expensive and heavy duty inflators (Vi-Air and Slime) do blow the fuses in my cars -- a 2006 Ford E-150 van, Dodge Caravan, and Honda Odyssey. For the price, this is a nice portable inflator. It's just kind of loud, and not real fast in inflating. Forget ever using the pressure gauges on any of these portable inflators."
120303,2,SENT THE WRONG ONE-RETURNED IT -FOUND IT CHEAPER AT A DIFFERENT WEB SITE-GOT THE SAME BRAND (DASHMAT)OTHER SITE WORKS GREAT NO PROBLEMS
130329,0,"Haven't tried out long enough but the blade seems to be of high quality. It works pretty well so far (i.e. no streak). My only complaint is for such a high-end wiper blade, the design of the U locking mechanism is too tall and thus looks ugly/obstructive on my Lexus IS-350. The original blade is 1"" high (at the middle) while the Valeo is 1.375"" tall at the plastic U lock.Decided to cancel delivery of the companion 22"". Will use the old blade and buy refill from dealer instead.PS. The refill rubber costs slightly over $5 at Toyota dealer (not sure if Lexus dealer charges more for the same part!) and works perfectly fine."
95180,0,"I bought this hitch ball as recommended by Amazon's ""buy it together"". The draw bar I ordered has a 1"" ball mount and the 72802 is a 3/4"" ball mount. Now I need to buy a bushing to make it fit. So much on trying to save a buck.The interlock does not work well with the 72802 as the base is too small."
35801,0,"I'm not sure i'd recommend it because you need serious patience when applying it. After all is said and done, it's fine. But it is a MAJOR pain to put it on. It took me probably about 30 minutes to do it. If you have the patience then go ahead but be aware that it might hurt your hands, it hurt mine.it's also not the softest thing, holding it when driving - the designs stick out and are a little rough. but i've been using it for almost a year, so it does seem to be fairly durable."
25483,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
24107,2,"Bought a 3A racing dual clamp on tip in fall 2009 for my 6 mnth old vehicle. It installed easy enough and looked pretty good. However, I soon noticed that the finish was not staying ""shiny"" and began to look dull and somewhat pitted. Then winter came with salt on roads and good night. This thing has rust spots everywhere. I have to polish it every 2 weeks just to get the rust off that has accumulated. Every 2 wks, rust spots (and we are talking as large as 3/8"") are back again. Frankly it looks pretty bad.I have had aftermarket and OEM stainless tips on my cars for 12 years, and NEVER has any been so unresistant to the elements as this one, and NOT ONE has ever rusted on the stainless surface. Yes, bolts of bolt on models have rusted, but never the actual stainless surface.Several attempts to email 3A racing with pictures resulted in NO reply. Great customer service.I cannot recommend any 3A tips. Quality of their ""stainless"" is very inferior. Pay a bit more and get something of quality so you don't have to deal with this hassle."
46460,0,"it works the way a radiator cap is supposes to work, holds 13 lbs of pressure and then some. buy it"
108280,1,Great as backup lights or for area lighting. Do not use as driving or fog loghts
52620,0,"Note: This review is mostly for the process of buying.Overall, I have been happy with my last set of tan colored WeatherTech floor mats. They worked very well, but the old tan colored mats became discolored over time (the composition of the rubber maybe?). I decided to purchase new black rubber replacements through Amazon. However, Amazon's ""make sure it fits"" was not accurate enough to select the proper mats for my 2002 Explorer. The mats Amazon sent (W11's) did not fit my '02 Explorer. Returning the mats to Amazon was not a problem, but unfortunately Amazon did not carry the correct W30 mats.Stephen Brown"
168545,1,it fits and works grate for cant complain i put in on and it just fire up thanks amazon for this product it made my day
27200,2,"My new Code Scout arrived today & I spent an hour trying to get it to work. It easily connects just fine but cannot read at all. Tech support went though the process with me as I tried several more times & finally said to send it back for replacement (At MY expense!) Well, it is not my 2000 auto since it was read just fine for emission testing last month and had a check engine light code read & reset just fine by a mechanic 2 weeks ago. Tech support agrees that it sounds like it is a problem with the code reader. I'll probably purchase a different brand locally since I don't trust this brand & I'd need to pay Shipping again if I need to return the replacement unit."
162802,2,"I remember seeing a lot of these in the 1970s when most decent folks didn't even know what ""horny"" meant. Now that most people are familiar with the term, why would you invite the honks of the people who would stoop to honk at such a vile sticker. Yuck. The only scenario I can think of where this would be funny would be if you stuck it on the butt of a rhinocerous."
53158,0,I have a 07 civic si when my gas tank was running low I dumped a bottle of this and filled up with gas. I ran the entire tank and I honestly felt no difference. The car runs exactly the same as it did before using this redline product. I didn't give it a low rating because it might work for people that have older high mileage cars but I also didn't give it a high rating because it did nothing to my car.
24668,1,"I bought these for a few reasons.#1. Price. Great price, especially because I have Amazon Mom and get free 2-day shipping. I just bought a new car and wanted to get rubber mats down before my son and I trashed the floors with the winter-slush. Got them super fast!#2. Style. I like the clear ones, of course they're slightly blue-ish. Any clear plastic that's thick has a blue-ish tint to it.Things I love about these mats:The rubber smell went away almost overnight. It was strong coming out of the box, but it went away fast.They fit quite well, of course they're not perfectly fitting. I didn't pay $200.00 for them! That's why!!!! I didn't expect them to. However, I did not need to trim them because the fit was so close. *WIN!*The edges and stuff are really deep, so you know the stuff inside them won't slosh over the edges, voiding the purpose of rubber mats!I love these mats, wouldn't want anything different!"
17917,0,"Fast service and the product does match to its website description. It will be nice to ship it in a box instead of a soft envelop, so the shipping will not damage to the product original box. I am okay since this is not going to be a gift for others."
61169,1,"Fitment is good, would be excellent if it had a tab for the stock clip to hold it in place. I bent the tab to help hold it while putting the cover on.Have used K&N; filters in all my bikes they work well and are easy to clean and oil."
109820,0,I'm sure it's a good filter. ...for whatever car it is intended for. You should go to the FRAM site and compare the manufacturer's model number with the one that Amazon suggests. Amazon took back the part that did not fit no problem - so don't be too scared
43531,2,"You can't beat the low cost of this headlight assy, which even includes the bulb. Unfortunately mine failed to adjust left to right due to a stripped gearbox. What really bugged me is that there is no information from the manufacturer so you can't call anyone for potential repair or replacement info. Amazon does provide a return option."
132161,0,"They work just as advertised; good quality, bright, and inexpensive. But the bulb was too wide and could not go in without modification to the harness. This is a fine buy if you are going to put them in a light that is not exposed to the elements, but since I had to break the seal it is not a wise choice to purchase these unless you want your headlights ect. to condensate after a wash or heavy rain."
78826,1,"this car cover is nice, it says on the box that the medium fits a compact car but it fit on my 85 5.0 mustang. on the box it recomended a large for that vehicle though"
33728,2,"I've bought two of these items. One lasted two (2) months; the other lasted one (1) months. Moreover, the straps broke easy. Buyer Beware!"
78634,2,"I had a small leak in my power steering rack and pinion unit, it left 1 or 2 drops on the driveway at night. After reading reviews on Amazon, bought this product, and added 1/3 to 1/2 bottle to my power steering, as directed. Now my vehicle leaves large puddles in the driveway, and will lose all it's power steering fluid in less than 3 days. My mechanic says entire rack and pinion unit must be replaced, cost $398.00. Would have been better doing nothing."
107333,1,"I got this to replace an electrical distributor and it came with instructions on which wires were necessary to eliminate any guess work. It's been over a year since I've installed it and recently took off the cap to inspect it and it looks great. Very reliable unit that keeps my engine running strong without any hesitation. I would buy it again, but I don't think I'll need to any time soon."
142694,2,"I bought the light thinking it would be bright and very visible at least when it is dark out, but after installing it (which was a big hassle and ended up wrecking my alternator) I turned it on to see that it is barely even visible through the light tint of my trucks rear window, big disappointment."
131453,0,"The laser parking guide works well and is easy to mount and adjust. However, I felt it necessary to remove one star for each misleading statement on the package.First, it says it can be powered by either battery or AC adapter. In the directions, it states that the battery is only for when there is a power outage and will not last for more than a couple of days. This is important because you probably will have to install an outlet for it. A 6 1/2 foot cord most likely will not reach from where your garage door opener is to where this needs to be mounted.Second, it claims to be able to mount with double-sided tape. Again in the directions, it says not to use the tape on the ceiling. Since that is the most likely place to mount it, I again consider this misleading.Other reviews can give you information on how well the laser works since apparently YMMV. I just wanted to alert the potential customer before they buy."
27484,1,I bought this creeper seat in anticipation of a rear brake job on my car. It was easy to put together and very sturdy. The creeper seat made the brake job so much easier by putting me on a level with the rear wheels of the car but in a sitting position. This seat is my new favorite toy. The tray in the bottom is surprisingly spacious and easily holds the various tools needed for most jobs in easy reach. Also great for motorcycle detailing! I highly recommend!
51437,1,I have installed and used last winter and will be using again this winter. seems to do the job as I strated the tractor in cold weather with very little effort. Make sure you have a flat surface large enough to stick it to.
146659,2,"Don't waste your money. These things are so cheaply made that they can't even make it to my home by mail without breaking (went through two of them this way). We're seriously talking below dollar-store quality here. Edelbrock should be ashamed. I opted to not bother having a third sent--after all, if it can't even make it through UPS, can I really expect any sort of accuracy from this thing?"
113920,0,"It does about as good of a job as liquid skin. If it get wet, it wears off.I did not buy this for human use. Quality on humans, I can not say how it does. I do know when getting it on my fingers, I can just rub my fingers together, it balls up and comes off easily. Again, my intentions were not for the use of humans.I bought this item to help prop my dobie's ears up. It does not leave marks, pull hair as many other methods do. It is easy to use. However it if get wets, it will not hold. For my dobie, I am reapplying it every other day fully and on smaller areas every day. It holds up as well as liquid skin does (which can be bought at walmart @ $5, dollar tree @ $1, dollar general @ $2.50).If you are planning on using this for propping up a dog's ears, I would recommend buying the surgical glue that vet's use. It does hold up longer.Again, I can not say how it works on humans."
106358,1,No problem with this product other than I ordered the incorrect color. The mat fit well and looked good. Being the incorrect color I no longer use this.
188431,1,"Put this on my keychain, bought the yellow in case of an emergency, where it maybe dark in the car, yellow would be easier to see. The seat belt remover blade is easily accessible, want to find an abandoned car to shatter a window, as it looks easy on the vid, but, I suspect the lbs of pressure one has to put on it, should not only be known in advanced, but tested! Glad I have both types, this one, and the hammer type! One (cosmetic only)drawback, I ordered 2 pairs of these in YELLOW, but, they sent a pair in GREEN, so, I should have sent it back, but, it was for a gift, so, time prohibited that, so, seller, please pay attention to each order placed, and if you are out of stock, tell the buyer, and let us know when the correct color will arrive, with no additional shipping charges!"
33000,2,"i did not order this part. the connector for the upstream oxygen sensors, ie the ones before the catalytic converter on the exhaust manifolds, on my 2003 solara sle v6 is different from the connector that is pictured. the white tab in the connector housing of mine runs the other way and has a nub in the center. the bosch 13540 pictured on amazon is the right connector BUT the ""make sure it fits"" your car feature says it is the wrong part for my car. buyer beware!a couple weeks ago i got the error code of p0155 which is bank 2 sensor 1 or the oxygen sensor on the exhaust manifold that is on the radiator side of the engine. i looked up the part on advanced replacement auto parts site and it called for the bosch 13540 or the denso 234-9021. my buddy who owns a body shop ordered what he said was going to be an original manufacturers part with his discount. i told him the part had a piece of pulple tape on it and the cable length was 8 inches. i do not know what manufacturer or part he got for me, he wouldn't let me pay for it. the part he sent me had a brown piece of tape on it and only 7 inches of cable. it was a stretch to connect but it worked. a week later i got code p0135. p0135 is bank 1 sensor 1 or the oxygen sensor on the exhaust manifold near the firewall. the car has only 55,000 miles. either these things need to be replaced in pairs or there is something else going on here. but enough about my trials.before ordering one online, be sure to open the connector and look in, and then measure the cable length. order one with the proper connector, and enough cable length. you may want to order in pairs!"
71340,0,"I have a 2005 Ford Ranger. It does truck work and is not babied. However, I do keep it maintained so I can get as many years out of it as possible. Once a year I give it a thorough wash and wax before winter. Thought I would go the extra mile this year with the clay bar system. I was very disappointed that it did not remove even water stains. I ended up using some Maguires Scratch-X that I had to get the stains off. It might work great on a vehicle that is waxed more often but did not do what I wanted."
107852,1,Exactly what we needed for my 99 Lexus RX300. Installed the new AFR sensor in about twenty minutes. My gas mileage improved from 12 mpg to 19.5 mpg (mostly city driving so I hope to get even better when we take a long hwy trip). The reveiws on amazon helped me make the right choice for my vehicle. thanks!
103203,0,"I bought this bracket to replace the mounting bracket of my 1997 Acura 3.0 CL due to frozen pins. I went to the site and inquired about compatibility issues and they said it would fit. The quality of product is good but when I was putting it on, I found out that it was not compatible with my vehicle. I returned it and received 100% refund. This is good, if it fits."
67642,1,"i have been using tanners preserve for years, recently i found out that they no longer has them in stores. when i saw that i could buyit at amazon, i was very happy to order it. i recommend this product highly."
171377,1,"THese are of Super High quality, much better that the zippered uppers. Very good tight seal, except at the very top of the doors there was just a tiny gap everything else if great. very solid build, i wouldnt hesitate to buy these."
18057,1,"So these things ar tiny but you actually can see better out of them compared to the factory mirrors. They are sold individually and not in pairs which I made the mistake of thinking, but even at the high cost, they are worth it for the looks as well as improving visibility behind and beside you. My factory mirrors were totally blocked by my body and I couldn't see behind me."
112787,0,"I bought this jacket for my husband along with the matching pants. It was difficult enough to find a set that wouldn't make him look like a Power Ranger so I settled on a black and grey combo, seemed to be the least flamboyant or clownish looking. The Pants seem to be fine and other than having to return for a smaller size (from large to medium, the legs were fine but once you got to the rear area it made him look like an inflatable lawn ornament) but the jacket was a huge disappointment. First time he put the jacket on the front zipper jumped the tracks and although we toyed with the idea of returning it we decided to keep it since we assume they installed shoddy made zippers into all of the jackets. He now has to pay special attention to how he zips it up, even if he is standing on the side of the road in the pouring rain. Now it DOES keep the rain out once you have it zipped up and as long as that zipper holds he should stay dry. Upon packing for a trip, he attempted to use the built in pocket for packing up the jacket. Well we were not surprised to find that the zipper for the built in storage pocket is equally if not even more shoddy and burst the on the first try. I am so disappointed! Tourmaster was at one time such a great company and you were able to find quality gear for a reasonable price. Now it has apparently 'outsourced', or made some other change to save money like so many others and, like everyone else the quality has suffered. I despair that we will ever again be able to find rain gear that works, we can afford, and doesn't make you look like a Power Ranger."
135839,2,"I purchased one of these. Installed it and it worked good for a little while. Then a wire in the light bar shorted out and caught the thing on fire. I could have lost my truck or done serious damage to the electrical system. I have photos of this for anyone that wants to see it. Recon has ignored 4 emails from me including the ones with the photos attached. Very poor product and customer service. I like the idea of the light bar and I am looking for another one, but I will never get one that was made from nor buy one from Recon."
78835,0,"March 2012 I purchased 3 of these coils for my 1999 Camaro and around the same time I purchased the DIS-4 Ignition system (about $1100 total for everything). For the first 6 months everything worked perfectly until one night driving home from work the car just died. When trying to restart the car it acted as though it didn't know the timing of the car anymore (firing cylinders out of order). I eventually used the MSD supplied bypass plug for the DIS-4 box and the car started. I sent in the DIS-4 for RMA a few weeks later and they tested it saying it was good.Long story short we eventually determined that it was a bad coil. But what caused the coil to burn out is the subject of this review.These coils have 2 bolt holes, one on each end. The one you can see in the picture (between the 2 plug wire towers) has a plastic insert while the one on the other end has a brass insert. The problem with this is that is where the plugs for the coil power connections are. There are 2 plugs (one on each side of the bolt hole) that come up from underneath and plug into the coil. These 2 plugs supply the power and ground to the coil. The problem with this design is that when you bolt it down the brass insert becomes conductive (because the bolt is grounded and in contact with the brass) and causes a short to eventually happen between the positive side of the coil and the grounded brass insert. This is what occurred on my car. The higher voltage and longer spark times generated by the DIS-4 ignition eventually burned a hole in the plastic surrounding the brass insert. Then when I tried to start it the power would short to the brass insert and cause the system to lose the cylinder firing times.I had to reinstall the stock coils so the car would run while I sent in the bad coil for RMA.MSD did RMA the bad coil but the original poor design remains. Right now I cannot run the DIS-4 ignition or the same issue will arise again as The new coil still has the brass insert.Now I am forced to either abandon using the coils, DIS-4 or modify the MSD coils to prevent this from occurring again. Since the coils are basically useless unless modified I will try drilling the brass insert out and replacing it with a piece of plastic tubing to prevent the power connections from shorting to the bolt.It is pretty sad that a performance ignition company with the reputation of MSD would create a product with such flaws. It really makes no sense at all for them to use a plastic insert on one side and then a conductive brass insert on the side with the power connections. I am beginning to wonder if Larry, Moe and Curly are working in their R&D; division.Final Conclusion is if you are going to run a DIS-4 or any other aftermarket ignition system then be aware you WILL have problems with these coils eventually.I ended up giving them a 3 star rating as the coil itself is good and seems to work as intended but the design is piss-poor."

84530,2,"My Chilton Nissan Pathfinder manaul that I bought in 2002 is the best and most detailed non-factory shop manual I have ever seen. Unfortunately the new ones are not the same. One of their bean counters who has never actually worked on his own car thought it would be a great idea to shrink everything down in size to save a few pennies on printing costs. I can live with the smaller main text, but for most of the exploded diagrams you need a magnifiying glass (and for some a microscope) to read them. Luckily there are lots of good used (and new) factory shop manuals out there at reasonable ""buy it now"" prices."
143506,0,"The lamps are a bit brighter, or illuminate the area directly in front of the vehicle a bit better. However, there is a distinct line above which the illumination ends - this line is lower than ideal. The switch to high beams is not as dramatic as other lamps I've used. The periphery is better lit on low and even more on high."
134749,1,"Redlinr MT-90 got rid of my reverse grind and second gear crunch. I previously had valvoline full synthetic which was rated at GL-5 compared to redline which was GL-4. Shifting was precise, not too much of a night and day difference but over time it's getting better. Will probably replace this oil with lightweight shockproof next time."

125634,1,"Growing up, we'd wash our cars with dish soap. With my own first car in college, I used whatever cheap car soap I could get at a big-box store. I finally have a garage/driveway again (moved out of the city) and bought this stuff to wash my car. I didn't expect to be amazed by a bottle of soap. It's clearly meant for washing cars, or at least things that are painted like cars: it doesn't streak or leave spots, it seems more waxy/shiny than crappier soap I've used before, and it washes off clean. There really is a difference, and I plan on buying more in the future!"
101989,1,"This tool works just as advertised. The boot however is not easy to work with. I have done tons of boots the old fashioned way, taking the axle out and the joints apart. It is easier to get the boot on but the clamps they give you are junk and the boot is so soft it is hard to work with. I rec. this tool but get yourself some better clamps or you will fight with the ones that come with it, like I did. With the right clamps this tool really cuts the work time. Note:This review is from Holly's husband, not Holly. I have been a mechanic for 15 years, I know a my tools."

They have the S T at the and of the part number, and there is a difference. After I received these, I thought they where week feeling, so I went to Advance auto and purchased some of there Monroe SensaTrack struts and they where firmer, and the part number was different. 71245 is the O.E. spectrum and the 71245-ST is the Sensatrack strut. The SensaTrack are a good strut for the price, but the O.E. is junk."
118413,0,The setup is a standard 2 pin connector with ring connectors to attach to battery. The advertisement said it also came with alligator clips but mine did not. Does have inline fuse so you don't short anything out.
125447,0,"I bought these to replace the broken latch on my '94 Ranger's rear sliding window. They're made cheap and the last one only lasted about a year. My second purchase broke the first time I went to latch the window after installing it. This is a very poor design, if you use the sliding window often. Unfortunately, without replacing the entire rear window, this is the only latch that I have found that fits. Three stars because it fits, minus two for being poor quality/design."
21262,0,"I was thinking about buying this horn, but it seems it does not come with a relay and from several other reviews on here it appears to need one. If your horn fuse is only 10 amps, you need a relay! I have installed many accessories over the years on various cars and trucks, including air horns. No problems if you do this:1. Buy a 4 pin 12V weather proof relay with a wiring harness from Amazon or auto store and some 16 gauge automotive wire preferably in the colors that match the relay harness wire. The relay allows you to control a high-current electrical load (air horn) with a low-current electrical 'signal' (the existing horn circuit). This prevents burned out horn circuits. Read the relay installation instructions. If you use a 5 pin relay, just do not connect the 87a pin to anything.2. Attach the new horn near the old horn if possible, but not near the radiator, hoses, or hot components.3. Run a length of 16 gauge wire from positive terminal of the NEW horn to the relay terminal marked as positive output power, sometimes labeled 87, OR follow relay install instructions, if available.4. Connect another wire from the constant power terminal on the relay (sometimes labeled 30) to an in-line 20 amp mini-fuse holder (take out fuse for now).5. Continue the wire from other side of fuse holder to a spare hot circuit in your fuse box or straight to the positive battery terminal, but don't actually connect it to power source till the end of the installation.6. Disconnect the power wire(s) from your existing horn(s) and connect this wire to the relay's ""switch"" terminal, sometimes labeled 86. This wire will activate the relay and provide the new horn with full 20 amp power when you press the horn button inside your vehicle.7. Ground the relay with a wire from the ground terminal, sometimes labeled 85, to a metal ground bolt or negative terminal of the battery or fuse box ground.8. Ground the new horn by running a black wire from the new horn negative terminal to an unpainted metal body part or negative side of battery or other grounding point that is connected to the battery negative terminal.9. Make final attachment to power source.10. Reinsert fuse in holder.11. Test. If horn doesn't blow, check connections, check relay wiring, check for blown fuses on your new horn and old horn circuit, test for power with test light, etc.The relay method provides safe adequate power to run the horn without potential damage to your car's wiring. I don't believe you should tap into an existing wire (unless with a relay) or use some circuit for another purpose! Use minimum 16 g auto wire, no larger than a 20 amp fuse, plastic corrugated wire protectors for a pro look, and solderless connectors if possible. Protect the relay by wrapping it in electrical tape and tuck it out of the way. Do not let wires touch hot radiators, hoses, or rub against metal car parts. Good luck. If I buy this horn I'll let you know what happened.Followup -- I decided not to buy this horn. I looked at one in an auto parts store and it's fairly small at 5"" square with a compressor directly attached to a small horn. The horn 'mouth' is about 1"" x 2"" and I had my doubts it would sound that good on my full size American truck. Loud maybe, but with that sized horn - high pitched for sure. It's for a motorcycle or small car in my opinion. It also has a relay in the package, so if you get one, I recommend you use it."
115215,0,Ok well i ordered this part 2 weeks ago and it has yet to ship since this is the only place i could find that would ship my part overseas i had to order from this company.. not to thrilled on the fact that it has yet to even be put in a box.
128828,1,"I had one of these pre-chargers on my last filter. It was closed at one end and fit quite nicely on the filter.This one is a bit different, it is open on both ends, and just fits ""loose"" on the filter. It will do its job, but not too crazy about how it looks."

2849,1,"Installation was easy, although the instructions aren't very clear on the mounting height.They instruct you to use the top holes on the hitch, but what if the hitch is of a different configuration or what if the top holes are already occupied?I would have liked to see an explanation of how far below the tray sits from the hitch surface, then I could confirm what holes to use.But otherwise, very happy with the construction and fit/finish - let's hope I never experience it in action."
75546,1,Absolutely perfect experiance. Great quality product that is well packaged and has all required directions in package. Love it love it!
82454,1,"When I first put this on my steering wheel, which took about 30 seconds, I didn't think I would like it. I really liked the look of it, but I didn't think I would like the feel of the bumpy part. And, at first, I didn't like it, and I tried to hold onto the smooth parts. But after several days of driving with it I actually do like the way it feels. I don't know why. And I wouldn't call it a massager. It just feels pleasant. It's good quality, and seems very durable. I just bought a 2011 Ford Ranger, and am in the process of getting rid of my 2002 Ranger, and I decided to buy everything new, and not switch anything from the old one to the new one (except my stereo, which is after-market, and awesome). So if it appeals to you visually, I would give it a shot. And if you do buy it, wait a few days before you decide if you like it or not. I was also pleasantly surprised that it didn't smell god-awful. (I know it said this in the item description, but I didn't believe it). FORD TRUCKS RULE!"

When you press on the accelerator, you get a little bit of a roar, but not much. There is very little drone at higher speeds which is fine. I also bought this muffler because I thought I could slightly improve my gas mileage, but not sure about that yet. I was just expecting more. I don't know anything about welding so I had it done at the local Midas shop. I think I will save my money again and try the Super-Flow model. Same brand."
116082,2,"This arrived missing some critical parts - the hinge assembly on one side. How it made it through the Thule assembly process is amazing, obviously nobody looked at it before shipping it. The hinge looks like it is installed at the factory and is not something that I could install if they sent me one.I have seen a few other reviewers of this product complain of the same problem.Amazon took the unit back, paid for shipping, and refunded my money. The return was very easy, all I had to do was go to the ""orders"" section and click on the ""return"" option. Amazon handled it all, I didnt have to contact UPS or anything. The next day UPS showed up at my house and took the box. 5 stars for the Amazon return policy and process.I ended up buying the SportRack A90275 Aero XL Roof Box. That comes preassembled."
109346,1,"The only drawback too this product is the size, if you want to stick it in the glove compartment. It's easy to use and very accurate. It locks on to the valve stem and you can bleed the pressure down very easily. The battery life is an unknown at this time,having only used it for 1 month. It is much better then any guage I have ever used."
120505,1,I have used this tool on over 6 different seals and each time it makes it so easy that you wonder how it was done before you used this. With the leverage point that moves it fits into almost any position.
97620,2,"I live in the Northeast and suction cups are worthless. They stopped working consistently after 6 months and are woefully ineffective in cold and hot weather. The product feels cheap and the plastic has melted around the suction cups. I guess if you drove in a climate controlled tunnel with no sunlight, then the EZ clip would be fine."
176869,0,"Either due to a faulty description or a faulty interpretation of the product's description, the product was not what I expected. I was expecting some sort of ""cover"" for the stock hinges, providing paint protection, covering already damaged spots, etc. I was not expecting hinges that would totally replace those already present. I've gone through the agony of replacing the stock (in my case) white door hinges with the same brand (Rugged Ridge) black door hinges. Getting the doors perfectly balanced and back in line so that they would close easily, smoothly, and correctly was impossible for me and thus I had to resort to turning the project over to a professional. After that experience I decided that if/when I wanted another part of my Jeep accented by switching it from white to black, that it would be easier (and probably cheaper) to just have that area painted instead of replaced.So, when I received the item, and it turned out to be another replacement project I decided that I would save myself the headache and returned the hinges. All that being said, I have many Rugged Ridge brand Jeep accessories, accents, and guards, and have been totally satisfied with the ease of their installation, appearance, and overall quality. In this case, this particular product was not for me."

11905,1,I have used the battery tender for several years on nearly all my equipment. It has saved me from having dead car batteries and makes sure that all my equipment in the barn starts up when I need it. I have a diesel arc welder that has a deep cycle marine battery. I put battery tender on it about 4 times per year just to make sure the battery is all charged up. I don't have to worry about going back out to the barn and disconnecting it to prevent overcharging. Battery tender has the electronics to not harm the battery.I haven't had any dead battery issues in any of my equipment since getting Battery Tender.

155668,0,"Quality product and well made. I use the orange squares for leveling and bought two of these, thinking I could just slap them down, drive up, and I'm set. The only problem is that I have a tandem axle trailer and these yellow pads are so long, that they won't fit in the space between the tires. Therefore, you can't get both axles elevated and that doesn't make for good stability. So now the pair are now sitting in my garage on the shelf. Great product for a single axle trailer (more convenient than putting together the orange squares) but not for a dual axle."
35342,0,"There are several political bumper stickers for the 2004 Presidential campaign that simply refuse to let go of what happened in 2000. ""Don't Elect Bush in 2004 Either"" is certainly in the same spirit as ""Re-elect Gore in 2004,"" and you clearly have a choice between the two in terms of being anti-Republican or pro-Democrat on this one. Then again, you could put the first one on the right side of your rear bumper and the second one on the left side, drive down the middle of a three lane highway, and see what side other cars pass you on, honking and making various hand gestures. However, I have to say that I think it is hard to look ahead to the future when you (a) are still complaining about the last election and (b) are not explicitly advocating the election of a candidate (hey, you still have to vote ""yes"" to vote ""no"" in this country). At least the shelf life on these bumper stickers ends on November 2nd.We know that most registered voters do not vote in this country and when the best bumper stickers are against candidates rather than for them, it is not all that surprising this is the case. Of course, if Al Gore was running again the 2004 election would be a foregone conclusion, because in the history of the republic the other two times a candidate was elected to the White House despite losing the popular vote (John Quincy Adams and Benjamin Harrison), both of those incumbents were defeated by their opponents in a rematch (Andrew Jackson and Grover Cleveland respectively). The latest Electoral College projection has the election coming down to, believe it or not, the state of Florida, where President Bush and Senator Kerry are deadlocked at 48 percent each. Whoever wins the Sunshine State will win the election unless, of course, the other candidate can move states from their opponent's color to their own.The election is a week from tomorrow and if I were going to make a prediction as to what is going to happen it would be the opposite of what happened in 2000: Bush will win the popular vote and Kerry will have more Electoral College votes. This prediction is based not on political philosophy or even an exhaustive study of polling data. It is based on the principle that irony is the master trope of the universe and that nothing would be as ironic as that particular result. Let me add that a week ago when it dawned on me that coming back from a 3-0 deficit in a best of seven series after giving up more runs than any team in postseason history was the perfect way to reverse a curse and you all saw what happened there. So scoff if you will, but I am on a roll."

28511,0,"Most aftermarket CV axles are substandard. EMPI axles are the best of the lot and an exceptional value. In my opinion, however, although they are new axles they do not compete with quality remanufacters. But there aren't very many. I ordered 2 EMPI 80-5511 axles. The were shipped as quickly as could possibly be expected. One had a slightly bent baffle plate. After examining the quality of the axles, I decided to only replace my single bad OEM axle rather than both front axles. The axle, installed well. Initially after the installation I experienced a shuddering vibration on accelerating in first gear. That's usually a sign of bad inner CV, or bent or imbalanced axle. Whatever it was it seems to have worked its way out after a couple of hundred miles and now rides fine. It does have a very solid feel to it. Although of comparatively better quality and value than most ""new"" axles or any part store remanufactured axles, I believe they don't compete with the quality of the higher priced Raxles nor the more comparatively priced MW Enterprise rebuilt axles (Subaru only). The mechanic I use on occasion considers EMPI to be manufacturer quality. I don't agree. In my opinion OEM axles are of much better quality although also much more expensive. I am not dissatisfied, but will prefer to go with Raxles or MW Enterprises in the future. I would definitely recommend EMPI over any part store new or remanufactured axles."

The only problem I see is that their type of spray bottle is very hard to use. You have to press hard with your thumb and only a few drops of liquid will come out. I ended up unscrewing the cap and using my thumb to control the amount of product I wanted to use. They must replace the spray system with a more professional one, easier to use."

62129,2,"I cleaned the faded black bumpers and trim on my 2003 Volvo S60 - the back bumper was seriously faded. I then masked the adjacent paint and applied 2 good coats of forever black - In all the process took about 2 hours. The car really looked good then, almost like new. My impression was, ""cool, this stuff is great!"". Judging by how difficult it was to clean up the spills, it seemed that it was going to stick and be durable. However, because I wanted to make sure the ""dye"" had cured, I did not wash the car for about 3 weeks. Then I used one of those automatic car washes that are at gas station/ convenience stores. The side trim still looks good but the rear bumper has lost most of the ""dye"" - it just washed off during the first wash! Maybe your results will be better if you have the time to hand wash your car, but do you really have time to always do that?"
77598,1,"It is hard to get worked up over a windshield wiper blade, but if any blade deserves special praise then the Valeo 600 series blade does. I heard about it when a certain leading consumer magazine ranked it first in their product test ratings. Admittedly, I was bit skeptical at first. I mean, how good could it really be? But, since it was affordable, and I needed new wipers for my 2003 Jetta, I thought I would try them out.I am happy to report that after 18 months of service they still perform almost as well as when they were new. They worked great when they were new, better then Valeo's own 800 series blades, which are the OEM blades, and they are still very good performers. Indeed, they worked so well for so long that I got spoiled and a bit picky. My standards of performance were actually raised by these blades. Gone are the days when I used to be satisfied with the mediocre performance of the fast, dirty, and cheap blades one typicaly finds for sale at the local auto parts store.You really cannot go wrong with these blades and I cannot see spending more to buy blades that cannot perform any better than these blades. They work relatively quietly, smoothly, and thoroughly. I have driven through hard rain storms with no problem with the Valeo 600 series blades. Theyare quite simply the best wiper blades I have ever had on any car I have ever driven.Which brings me to my last point. You will be hard pressed to find Valeo blades at your local parts store because they are not the huge volume, low to medium quality blades that one typically finds in local stores. You typically have to order them online and the best place to do so is Amazon.Do yourself, and you car a favor, and give them a try."

96624,0,I like scissor jacks because when you get stuck in the mud they can get under the frame without a lot of extra digging. I also use them in woodworking as a spreader and dis-assembler. This one is well made with a good action but the drive/crank shaft end attaches by a square drive and is held in place with a snap ring. This makes it easy to get in and out of the drive socket but also means that when you are cranking it pops out if you get even a little bit out of line. They seemed to be trying to engineer it as a universal joint for convenience but what they wound up with is not all all convenient.

95915,0,"I would have given these mud flaps 5 stars if the mounting hardware was not so cheaply and poorly made. The flap attaches to the fender by means of tabs that clamp on to the inner lip. However, the screws that tighten these tabs are so poorly made that they do not thread properly into the tabs. The first one I tried got stuck before it even began to tighten, causing the very small allen head to strip. The head actually twisted off when I tried to loosen it with vice grips. I then resorted to drilling out the broken screw and removing it with a screw extractor. However, the screw was so badly stuck that it broke my extractor. I then finally drilled out the entire screw, taped the tab with a 5/16 bolt thread, and used my own bolts to mount the tabs. After wasting two hours of my time with one fiasco after another, I finally got the mud flaps mounted. With quality hardware, the job should have taken 10 minutes, tops. Maybe I just got a bad run of screws, as the threads were wavy and coarsely made. For this type of mounting system, the bolts should be bigger than 1/4"" anyway, and not employ small allen bolts.With all the troubles of the mounting hardware, I must say that the mudflaps themselves are very nice. They fit perfectly, look great, protect the body underside, and are not too long for most off-road use. Just be very careful with the mounting hardware--better yet, use your own 1/4x20 bolts with regular bolt heads and you'll be happy."
125670,1,One of the few times I've had no surprises when buying an aftermarket item. The exhaust fit perfectly and went on with no difficulty. Perfect fit and sounds great too!!!!

50332,2,"Bought this product based off of its rating on Amazon...However, I'm with a few other reviewers that haven't seen much/any improvement on treated areas. My application was on both concrete (brand-new) and cobblestone. The grease trap on my grill was dislodged and about a pint of hamburger/steak/chicken/vegetable oil/grease was spilled in approx a 5' splash radius. I tried to immediately treat with hot water, shop towels and spot-clean with dish soap. Of course, results were next to nothing. As I procrastinated and let it set in (95 degree Houston weather/sun) for about a month it had plenty of time to bond. I applied this product in its suggested diluted state, slightly less diluted, then straight full-strength. I tried at night, during the day, and even directly after a strong rain. Very, very, little fading to the stain occured after 4-6 applications of this stuff. Either my stain is untreatable or this stuff is crap. I'm trying other products over the course of the next few days, I'll update this review if anything changes."
157677,2,The mats shown in the ad vs the mats I received are not the same. As I indicated in an earlier review the mats shown have eyelets for securing to the floor of the vehicle. My car 2010 Cadillac DTS has the catches in the floor for the mats with the eyelets. The mats I received do not have that feature. They tend to move and not be stationary.

98762,2,"Amazon clearly states that these shocks are for my land cruiser 1999, when i took it to the mechanic he said yes they are made for this vehicle but for the Gasoline type, I have the diesel engine type, which uses a hydraulic shock that lift's the vehicle at a certain altitude with a touch of a button inside the deck: low,normal and high, so theses shocks are just a waste of my money because of amazon's bad/short filter search, they should clearly put engine type for these cases because these parts are very expensive and to make a mistake is a real killer."
111332,1,This air filter was a quick drop in replacement for the Honda ATC 250 ES Big Red. The Honda shop wanted $35.00 for theirs and I believe this UNI Air filter is of better quality for half the cost. I used a different filter oil which was a little thinner than I think the filter needed. I am not sure about the oil spray from UNI but hopefully the oil I used will not degrade the foam too quickly.
162840,1,"I looked all over the internet, eBay, stores, and my local motorcycle shops for these, and found that this vendor had them, and the price was right. They fit perfectly, and did exactly what I wanted them to do......block the wind coming up my legs and shaking my helmet.Now, even in 40mph winds, and doing 80mph on the bike, (that's equal to a 120mph wind)... my helmet stays still.YEA !!!Packaging was good, but they were slow on shipping, and they arrived the last day of their estimate."
100915,1,Used this product on my 2006 Dodge Charger and all I can say is WOW!! It really brought out a nice smooth surface for a good coat of wax. Took out some minor scratches with ease. One major scratch was hardly noticeable afterward. It goes on with ease and is easy off. Great Product. Will use on all my vehicles. Will take on my daughters 1998 Camry next.

121004,0,I wore these rain pants and a rain jacket from same brand. I got caught in a downpour in Nebraska and got seepage in the crotch area. I checked the seam but no holes. Same thing happened again on other similar occasions. Good for light rain and wind protection only. That's the only reason why I kept them. Plus they breath a little.

151003,0,"I had these installed on my '09 BMW GS1200. They replaced the Touratech Xenon Lamps on my '05. I had planned to switch them out, but the ballasts would not fit anywhere on the new frame. No doubt, these PIAA's are bright, but they're kind of tacky looking with their chrome bezels, silver painted housings and blue lenses. Very kiddy-biker, poser stuff IMO. Like I said, bright: Too bright, actually. The beam is very far-reaching, but diffuse. There is not pattern to adjust, just a flare of light that you can only adjust vertically. Blinding to look at actually, and they generate a lot of heat: After only 1-2 minutes the lenses are too hot to touch, which makes me wonder about their longevity. I did get a nice CNC billet aluminum bracket out of the deal which, if I decide to ditch these, will accommodate some new Xenon's which run cooler, have a more focused beam and longer life. Price is quite comparable between the two.One nice feature on these lights is the activation switch used by my Dealer (Franks Motorcycles in Essex Jct, VT) lights are powered on and off by the off switch for the turn signals on the right bar. A small LED mounted on the engine cowl glows red or green (off or on), making the installation clean and OEM in appearance.Bottom line: If Touratech made left and right side Xenon's for the '09, I'd buy them. Otherwise these PIAA's do provide a vast improvement over the stock lighting. That makes them worth the $870 I paid for the lights, CNC light bracket, switch wiring and installation."
52723,0,"My wife bought me this for my 03 PT Cruiser CRD and it worked fine. Also tested on an 04 Corsa CDTI and a Nissan X trail. It read all cars without a problem. Unfortunately all were healthy so could not try the reset facility.Note.. As far as I can see it does not appear to reset the ""maintenance due indicator"" which is a big minus for me. Hence 3 stars, If I'm wrong then 5 stars."

136112,1,I ordered this cap to replace one that had a broken locking hook. This cap fits great and the addition of hose connector to allow for the draining of grey water is handy. No reason why this product shouldn't last a long time.
152002,2,"This Carter fuel pump looked fairly good when I purchased it 6 months ago. I installed it on my 1979 GMC 4x4 snow plow. The pump worked through the winter as advertised. Just guessing, I would say I used the pickup about 10 times through the winter X 1 hour per use = 10 hours running time. This spring I unhooked the plow and parked the pickup. Next time I went to start the PU (2 weeks later) my trusty GMC would not start. After much checking, I finally realized that this pump had stopped working. Took it off and tested and retested -- it sports an internal rattle (when connected to 12 volt DC) and it no longer sucks. The pump is 'kaput', no doubt about it. For me, this pump was a bad investment."
21155,2,"Strike #1: The description for this horn on Amazon implies (or did when I purchased mine) that the horn blasts both high and low frequency tones depending on how you wire it to your vehicle. NOT true! There are two terminals, but one of them is for ground and the other for +12 volts. This resulted in my wasting $10 because I ordered two horns, planning on a dual tone installation. I wondered how they could make a dual tone horn for such a low price, now I see that they can't. This problem is almost worth two strikes; it may be to someone else.Strike #2: The horn does fit my 4runner, but I had to slightly bend the bracket to make the horn fit between to the Air Conditioning freon line and the front grille. This would not have been necessary if the horn had a forward facing diaphragm instead of the rinky-dink plastic trumpet that has to face any direction but forward and adds more than an inch to the diameter of the horn on the long side of the trumpet. Because of this problem, the horn is boxed in with the plastic trumpet too close to both the AC freon line and the front grille. I think it is going to vibrate too much (because of the flex in the bracket) and will result in a rattle over rough roads.Strike #3: The horn doesn't seem any louder than the factory horn to me at all. Maybe it would if the trumpet faced forward, or maybe it would seem louder if there were dual tones.Three strikes equal a 2-star rating.Overall, this was not a good investment for me. Fortunately, I spent less than $20 for the pair.The only reason I didn't give this a 1-star rating is because I was able to use the factory horn cable to connect this horn, so the description that it fits my vehicle was accurate in the fact that it installed without any modifications to my vehicle."
109924,2,This is a large waste of money. It does not fit and without major modifications there is no way to make it fit. It is incompatible with the built in racks. Waste of money
5582,2,"only installs one way, still doesn't conform to the actual shape of the door frame. better than nothing, that's about it."
99552,1,Great product. Can't find a single thing negative to say about it so I will leave it like this. Why buy anything that has only few adjustments when this product has the range and infinite adjustments to fit almost every vehicle and trailer combination you can think of?
6772,1,"I have a Mazda6 with very little clearance around the wheel well, so regular tire chains don't work. I even tried the GoGlaws which are supposed to have a much slimmer profile without any luck. Someone on a Mazda forum suggested the Super Z6 and I went out and bought it on amazon. It fits my car, which I'm very pleased about. It's a little hard to put on, lots of tugging and pushing and this was just a dry run in my garage. Not had to use it on the roads yet. Still, given that this is the ONLY chain that fits a Mazda6, it's much better than nothing."

90755,0,"Amazon doesn't sell this plug for my Subaru. I'm putting it here as a public service. I had four of these in my Subaru for 50000 miles. They worked fine. Except one had the whole corner of the ground electrode shear off. I don't know if it's still in the cylinder or not, but the whole corner is cleanly gone. Overall, there's not much wear on the ground electrode. The spark was grounding almost on the side of the electrode after that part of the electrode sheared off. Not good. And I still wonder if I don't need to stick a magnet on a stick down the spark plug hole and try to get that piece back.Anyway, the laser iridium probably solves this as the ground electrode has a platinum disk on it."
153470,0,I bought these with the idea that I could put a valve cap on to keep out the dirt etc. but they are smooth. Not sure my air inflator will lock onto these without holding it on. It locks onto the threads of regular valves. Ordered metal ones since with threads. I kept these for my recumbent bike. Might work ok with that.

131623,0,"This is a pretty cool trailer and we liked it fine initially. However, we discovered a split in the tub of the trailer and it is exactly at the base of a manufacter's stamp. The company does not see that as a ""manufacturers defect"" and suggested JB Weld to repair. Less than two weeks later, the bearings in one wheel fell apart. When we contacted them about it, they stated that the ONLY solution was to purchase another entire wheel/tire assembly at a cost of $69.00. Because the trailer was just a few days past one year, the company replaced it. When we received the new wheel, we got the number off the new bearing, did an internet search and found the company that manufactures that bearing. We were able to order new bearings for less than $15! If this company were customer oriented, they'd make the bearings available for replacement. They've missed the boat."

90634,0,"The light bulb is wonderful. It's halogen, very bright but it heats up the fixture, so be mindful when sitting in reverse. Good idea to keep it less than a couple minutes. More later. The Alert: It is supposed to &#34;BEEP&#34;. When it sounds Feeble and sounds like hungry sheep or a duck and people are looking, It will soon be silent. I drive for a living - an excess than 40k/yr. I have a number of vans, each with at least one of these units in the drivers rear. The beepers rarely last me a whole year in my active vehicle. I' sure most people would do much better than I, as I get a saltwater bath more than once a week and every day do many miles of unpaved roads full of potholes and water in the winter and potholes and dust in the summer. Just a few days ago (Wed) I replaced the unit again. It was lighting up but the beep only lasted a week. Tonight (Sat), I just moved my van to unload and silence again. The light was good, (It's very dark here and I'd know instantly if one was out). I opened the door and peered back. Lots of light. I stopped the engine and turned on the key...Light but Silence. There's only one circuit in these units. Whenever they light, they beep and vice versa. If only one function is working, the problem is not the wiring in your vehicle, It's the unit. Recently I've had a lot of failures. I count 4 failures now in the 2 years I've had this van and now I'm going to write the company to avoid a fifth. Very frustrating to say the least. I've been using these for better than 15 years. On one occasion I know the Alarm warning did pay off. Funny story involving a tourist but I'll spare you. I do know my back-up alarm did the job that day.Note: It's really easy to order the wrong unit. The 3156 bulb is the rectangular bulb socket. The other style is the round bulb, (older 1156 style). More about the heat...My personal experience. If the backup light fixture is really dirty or gets cracked and dirt/dust gets inside, it will overheat easily. The plastic lens won\t melt or anything like that. The bulb socket gets cooked and deteriorates over time till it no longer functions and you have replace the whole unit which may or may not include the whole tail light fixture. This is intended for myself as well: &#34;We all know that proper attention to one's vehicle is the best way. to go.&#34;"

It's surprising how much water comes out when I drain it (usually every 1-2 months)."

It's no lightweight, but has the power necessary for those difficult jobs that the off-brand units just can't deliver. Only initial complaint is the yellow head guard doesn't fit that great and of course being a soft cloth material (vs. vinyl) will not clean up as easily as most standard head guards.If you're looking for a well built unit that pushes out the type of torque it's actually rated for and don't want to spring for high end name brand unit, look no farther, this is by far the best option around in the 1/2"" impact gun arena."

There are two 20W50 formulas from Royal Purple, but I had a hard time discerning what the difference actually is, so I got this one (cheaper). Compared to Mobil 1 20W50, my motorcycle runs hotter and the valve train makes more noise. After about 2500 mi., I drained it out and put Mobil 1 back in. Much better. Also, the oil causes the engine to produce a ""sweet"" smell. This is normal according to Royal Purple and due to its formula, but, mixed with exhaust, it smells awful. My bike doesn't burn oil... it's just the smell Royal Purple is associated with. I don't like it. Also, Royal Purple oil new is very dark (and dark purple). Mobil 1 is the standard synthetic light brown/amber color. At least I can tell with Mobil 1 that the oil is contaminated - it turns dark, not starts dark. Not a fan, and will use the rest of my bottles in the primary or hand it over to friends who are willing to trust it. I'm sure it's fine, but not for me."
