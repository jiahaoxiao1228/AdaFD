3681,1,I order this cap for a friend of mine and it was just the one that needed for his 2001 Volvo.Was well wrapped and came in in perfect condition.
94444,1,"Bought both the upper and lower radiator hoses in conjunction with a new radiator. Installation was much easier than I had anticipated. So far, so good. very happy with the price."
56709,1,"I'm new to ATVs and didn't realize the batteries need to be trickle charged over the winter so when the first spring came around, it was an expensive learning experience since I had to buy four new batteries. I wish I had bought this Battery Tender sooner... it would have saved me money. The construction of the outer shell is not as solid as I would have liked, but it will do fine and I guess it helps to keep the price down. I really like having one unit instead of four separate chargers to plug in. And IT WORKS. That's the big thing. My batteries are always fully charged when I need them and they seem to hold a charge longer and have more power in cold temperatures than before. I would definitely recommend this."
68353,2,"..but I doubt it.Got my LifeHammers today. They are disturbingly small and light; not something that gives me great confidence if wife or I needed to use them in an emergency. They couldn't weigh more than 2 or 3 ounces each with handle, and the ""window shattering"" cylinder at the top of the ""hammer"" is merely 2 1/2"" long and 1/2"" in diameter, pointed on both ends. Hey, I understand physics and high forces concentrated with little effort using a sharply pointed tool, but while I'm gonna keep them.... not sure if I/we are more safe than before.BTW, The LifeHammer comes with a large plastic mount for supposedly 'easy' access that surely has built-in screwmounts for potentially self-drilled screw holes. Thankfully, if one carefully reads the instructions, this is *not* a LifeHammer recommended installation without professional installation to preclude original, pre-existing wiring damage to your vehicle. To that end, they recommend installing the 'mount' via velcro attachments (which are neither included or explained further) on the bottom end of a 'mount' that is pretty much concave with little flat surface area to accomplish any chance of a secure velcro attachment between the Hammer/mount and the vehicle floor, dash or any other surface.We put our 2 LifeHammers in the console boxes between the two front seats... and hope to heck we never have to use them."
184156,1,"The plate looks great! No complaints - it looks just as promised, is shiny, and is holding up well after several long-distance trips."
160358,1,It was exactly what I needed. Came pre-greased and ready to go. Got it installed and has been working perfect. Great item!
11177,0,"Love the product, but, out of the two I purchased, one holds air and the other doesn't. Put it under water to see where the leak was. One of the seams was leaking quite allot of air. tried to seal it with rubber cement, but it was no use. Finally threw it away. But the one that holds air, I love. I would like to buy another one, but wonder what percentage leak."
87430,1,Fit just right and got better gas mileage. Easy to in stall and maintain. Now if I could find a cheeper exhust system.
108901,1,"DID NOT REALIZE HOW THE HEADLIGHTS ON MY VEHICLE HAD DIGRESSED UNTIL I WAS ON MY WAY HOME FROM NOVA SCOTIA CANADA TO FLORIDA IN WHICH THERE WERE MANY HOURS OF NIGHT DRIVING.....WHEN I HIT TWO NIGHTS OF RAIN I COULD HARDLY MAKE OUT THE ROADWAY AND REALIZED IT WASN'T MY ""GETTING ON IN YEARS EYESIGHT"", BUT MY VEHICLE HEADLIGHTS FAILING TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE ALLUMINATION!!! AFTER SEEING SYVANIA'S ADVERTISEMENTS ON THEIR SILVER STAR HEADLIGHT BULBS I DECIDED TO GIVE THEM A TRY. PRIOR TO ME CHANGING THE BULBS I PARKED MY VEHICLE ON A DARK LONELY PORTION OF MY ROAD, TURNED ON THE OLD HEADLIGHTS, AND MARKED OFF THE DISTANCE ON BOTH THE LOW AND HIGH BEAMS. AFTER CHANGING THE BULBS I REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT AND FOUND THAT THE DISTANCES HAD INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 100%. I REALIZE THAT BULBS WILL DETERIATE WITH AGE BUT WHEN MY VEHICLE WAS BRAND NEW THE HEADLIGHTS WERE NEVER THIS GOOD. CUDO'S TO SYLVANIA ON THEIR ACHIEVEMENT ..THE BULBS LIVE UP TO THEIR CLAIMS...THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS HOW LONG WILL THEY LAST????"
36383,1,"It filters my fuel, or at least i think it does. My car runs, so it must be working. It's Wix brand, so it must be pretty good."
81420,2,"Not all that great, removed some marks, it did state that if the area went black stop using it, and yes it went black and looks worst now."
58909,0,this box is an empty black box and for 10.00 its not worth it. You can get you a regular box that will do the purpose.
84463,1,"Fits the Mazdaspeed 6 oil filter housing cover perfectly. Obviously, you need a 3/8"" socket wrench. Be sure to have a 6 mm Allen wrench handy in order to remove the drain plug in the filter housing. Things are a lot less messy if you remove the plug after draining the crankcase and before removing the filter housing cover with this tool and your socket wrench. You need to be sure to seat the Allen wrench deeply into the hex hole in the plug -- some gorillas managed to ""round off"" the more superficial level of the hex hole on my car..."
149433,0,"Good article and very practical. Only downside is the base where the lights are placed, they are very weak and break easily"
43384,1,It has everything you need in here. Not super rugged or well made but it should work once in a pinch. Has all the basics plus a few nice things that will be handy in an accident or roadside emergency.
16300,2,"After first receiving the batteries I charged them all, only one of the six took the charge. After various attempts, I finally got 5 of the 6 to charge, but the sixth refuses. Makes you wonder if the vendor test their product before sell them."
26313,2,"I've had this thing for about 3 weeks now and haven't been able to use it. I managed to jimmy-rig the mirror to my car's backseat as the directions specified, but it's impossible to see it from my rearview mirror. The thing falls down even before I can get the car to move. Sounds like a great design, but I really wished I had read the reviews before purchasing. Great in theory, but just shoddy engineering."
81944,1,Went right in. Not being something I do very often it was nice that it was OEM and was able to install it with the new wire set and plugs. I used the old coil with no problems bolting it on.
128860,2,"I previously had a basic snap down cover on my 2006 Ranger shortbed which I absolutely loved. Unfortunately 11 of the snaps had broken and it was time to replace. The Extang Blackmax is a great looking cover but it did not fit well and I found the features to be more of a liability than an improvement. First, the snaps on the bed rails are made of fiberglass and will warp if you do not fit the cover snap perfectly cetered over the rail snap before attaching. If you try to come in from the edge it causes the snap to peel back and in my experience this was unavoidable on tight corners. Second, the snaps are free floating on the rails. Sounded pretty cool to me but...NO - I would much rather prefer snaps that anchored with screws that stay firmly in place. You have to wiggle the cover around to center it. I'd rather take the time to align the snaps once and make it secure. Third, the spring loaded bows - thought that sounded cool too. But no, the caps pop out easily which is no big deal but that just increases install/uncover time. And last...the fit was impossibly tight. I set the bows to the lowest position and the snaps to the loose side but still struggled. There's no way this thing would go back on w/o sunshine and warm weather. Therefore, I returned and purchased a trifold which was more money but much more functional. I understand many customers are happy with the Blackmax and the company has a good reputation for quality...but this just didn't work out for me."
75224,0,I am going to send this back. I bought the car used and it did not come with remote entry. I don't know if it originally did but I thought it was worth a try. They should probably explain on the site that there are other items you need to make this work if not. I just assumed like with many cars they come with them and if you don't order it when you buy the car new it is still there but you don't get the fob. I could have done my research better but I assumed too much I suppose if that is what you need and all you need there is no issue with it.
150966,2,I was looking at exhoust tips which this items pic is of. I sent an email after I ordered it and realised the description disnt match the photo but it still has same photo over a month later. Its not just their falt I should have read beter but it is their fault if anyone else gets screwed because I told them
73400,0,"I have an old ""Absorber"" from a few years ago. I ordered new ones to replace it when it wears out. I notice that the new product is not as thick as the older one and does not absorb as much. I also noticed that the price hasn't gone down to reflect less product."
121745,0,"I have used Zymol wax products before and been very impressed, so I decided to spring for the 12 fluid ounce, $28 tire preserver, to see how this was different from the 3M Tire Restorer and Armor-All products I have used before. This being the first time I use this product, and not being a molecular engineer, I cannot comment on its claims. That water would dry out the oils in a tire, is highly suspect, unless the water is mixed with a strong chemical. What I can tell you is that the bottle is very flimsy, very soft plastic, and when you pump the spray, it does not let air into the bottle and so you have to unscrew the cap open every once in a while, to let the air in. Another problem is that the sprayer top swivels as you pump the product, and so it sometimes goes everywhere but its intended spot! The enclosed cover for the sprayer mechanism, fits less than snugly and so if you leave the product in your trunk, it is prone to leak. For its price, Zymol could cerainly do better!!! The solution is of course to put the product in an old armor-aLL bottle or a generic pump sprayer, but honestly!As far as the product itself, it leaves a nice oily-film, smells relatively nice, and it is more difficult to remove from your hands than other tire dressings. I used baby wipes, and then dishwashing detergent to finally get the product off. One thing that I did notice, is that that the terry cloth towel I was using, was a lot 'dirtier' using the Zymol, than the other water-based products. Whether that was actual dirt, or rubber coming off, is anyone's guess! While I do not believe this has any petroleum distilates, I know Michelin recommends water based products, and even attempted to market its own tire dressing, which I have yet to be able to obtain. It was made for them by a company in Florida."
150406,1,Radiator was a perfect fit. Shipped in very good packaging to protect it. Very impressed with this Chinese made OEM type radiator for my 1997 Infiniti QX4 (Pathfinder). It was the best price available by far and shipped for free arriving promptly.
185012,0,"Overall the product is well made and will work great.....once you get the mounting kit. Buried deep in the description is a very short blurb about how the mounting kit is not included. This should have been included in the product description as to not cause confusion. Now we have to wait another week to get the mounting kit to be able to put them on the truck. Also, in the box with our item was a return slip for someone else that returned this product. I don't mind having a product that was unused and returned, just not really sure it should have been left in the box with my items. In all we will keep and use the item, but shoppers beware that the mounting kits are NOT INCLUDED!!!"
83986,0,"It is not working 1 mile away as advertised, but maximum 2 blocks away will do the trick."
70759,0,"It is nice, but it isn't the same as the picture"
123956,1,Better Airflow and nice intake sound make this a definite add to my Concours. I will add a fuel controller and new exhaust and it will increase power and MPG....
38250,0,GE H1-55NH/BP2 Nighthawk Automotive Replacement Bulbs - Pack of 2Save your money and stay with stock bulbs and save a few bucks!
26109,2,I've had it for a year and the gun works fine but the batteries don't .At a year old they run down too soon. Have too take them to Batteries r Usto get them rebuilt for $46 each.
155051,2,"I was some how optimistic... overly optimistic that the item would be as described.It's not metal, it's cheap plasticDon't believe the item description:""Rim frame made of die cast zinc & the bubble shield is acrylicEnduring quality that can be both seen and feltEach metal frame is carefully hand polished""It's just black and clear plastic"
18443,2,Unit appears well designed but poorly manufactured. Screw is a very loose fit in the body and will probably strip the threads after a few hard uses.
64217,0,"I haven't had any water spot problems. I think the reason I haven't is because of the method I've used for the spot free rinsing. If you spray until you can't physically see water spots anymore then I don't think you'll get water spots. This is, however, tedious because it takes a while to make sure you've spot free rinsed every inch of your car. While it's taking you that extra time, you're also wasting the filter that is used in this process (and the reason the water pressure is so low in the first place).My only other complaint is that I don't have a bucket. Nothing beats pulling out a mitt or a rag from a giant soapy bucket and washing your car with all that extra soap and what not. I tried to soap down the rag I was using with the unit itself, but it just wasn't the same. It would be nice if the soap spray was a bit thicker as well.It is convenient to be able to switch from soap to spray quickly though. It helped me blast off a couple of spots that a regular hose nozzle might have more trouble with.Overall, it takes a bit longer to use this wash method than the conventional bucket of soap way. In the time it takes to use this chances are your car will come out a lot cleaner anyway..."
45477,1,"This dashmat fit our 2001 Honda Odyssey perfectly. It came with about a foot of velcro-like material to fasten the cover to our dashboard, but we only needed a couple of inch's worth to hold it in place."
154489,1,"The plastic in the frame & cover is a little thin, but good for the price. The 'chrome' seems to be the color of the plastic itself, so it wont wear off. Should be good for years of routine service."
182799,0,"I got these on closeout a while back, and I was pretty impressed. The expander feature is definitely a plus, and it does allow you to put significantly more gear in your bag than you otherwise could. The rain covers are pretty much only good if your bike is sitting still since they don't really seem to latch on or tie down in any way. Another small gripe that I have is that it doesn't seem like I can really get the bags close enough together to properly fit over the tail of my bike. Granted, I have a sport bike with a pretty narrow tail, but it just always looks as if the bags are permanently sagging. These bikes have the integrated clips for the Fieldsheer Tail Bag, however, that product was discontinued, so I can't really recommend these bags. If you're looking for something in the same price range that will do the job just as good, and is still being supported, I'd check out the Cortech Sport bags instead. However, if you only want the saddle bags, and you want something that works reasonably well, these do the job."
20017,0,"I just bought these gloves for riding in cold weather in Central Fl. The owner of the shop here in Daytona, said he owns a pair and is happy with them. My ride, when wearing them, will be approximately 45 minutes at temps between 40 - 32 degrees in speeds up to and around 70mph on the infamous I-4. Anything colder, I'll drive the cage. I'll check back once I get a chance to really give a good review."
113867,0,Boots way too thick. I can't fit my foot under the shift Peddle. Feet cann't breath....not worth the money...$60.00 the most.
102762,2,"i instal this starter in my car and i have all kind of noises when i start the car,i bought this starter bicous it was written prim um quality,and this starter is not good"
113465,0,"Es s&uacute;per suave al tacto, de buena calidad y una apariencia fina y elegante. El &uacute;nico problema es quequeda muy arriba cuando se atornilla. Yo la instal&eacute; en un Mazda 3 y al poco tiempo tuve que poner laoriginal debido a que la MOMO quedaba muy arriba y los cambios quedaban m&aacute;s largos, es m&aacute;s c&oacute;modo quelos cambios sean cortos."
33050,2,"I use silicone adhesive for many things, and always try to keep it on hand. This was unequivocally the worst I have *EVER* used in my entire life ... all dried up and impossible to extract from the tube. I finally had to cut the bottle apart with scissors and use a dowel to retrieve what little was useable. I will NEVER buy this again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
42309,2,They are clearly selling seconds. Many inperfections in the sunshade. The shades will not last.
95507,1,"I use this for everything. The c clamp in this kit is very handy to have around. I used this tool on an 1986 Monte Carlo with original ball joints and it popped them out without a single problem. Presses them in without a single problem. Its easy to use and definitely a money saver if you are a do it yourself mechanic, so you dont have to remove control arms and take them to the parts store to be pressed, or take the car to a shop. Simply attach the proper cups and turn the screw until its out. Takes mere minutes."
155362,0,"Got the unit in a box banging around with no packaging!Called vendor about it, was told next one would come the same way!If you like stuff that's been bounced off a UPS truck floor a dozen times, buy one of these. Good luck.Hope it works when I install it!"
63314,0,Xantrex Xpower Powerpack Solar #852-2071In my review on this product if possible you can make power regulator that takes 110V/AC-240V/AC for international use.
8077,1,I have these lights for my 2005 Chevy Silverado. They have a sharp and crisp looks to them. I enjoy the mix that the amber light and the blue tint creates. Make the front look slick.
117490,1,"They are comfortable, look good (for motorcycle boots), are waterproof after hours of standing in snow and slush (yes, I know they're not intended for shoveling snow off the driveway) and offer much more protection than construction or other type boots. Great value for the money."
90045,1,"The unit has performed better than I expected for the small amount paid for it. The fan is about medium in noise generation but not a bother. I use it to power lights for all seasons (Christmas, Easter, Halloween etc.) in a commuter van. Great Power Inverter and highly recommended."
134043,0,"I ordered this hose nozzle and also the Toro 8 spray garden hose nozzle. I wish I had ordered two of the Toro nozzles. The Bon-Aire has four settings which is ok, but there is no indication on the nozzle head which spray it is set to. It is easy to turn and feels like good quality, but the Toro is fantastic! I would recommend another type that is labeled so you can choose which spray you want before you turn your hose on."
78193,2,This is a cheap version of my original car radio knobs. I was expecting to receive knobs that had metal half round fittings to attach to the radio tuner and volume selector. These are all plastic and a press fit. I also didn't realize that the knobs came two to pack and ordered two (2) packs and doubled my order. I would have been happier to pay more for better quality that was more like the original Mazda Tribute parts.
60306,1,"I bought these 25 ft jumpers for the upcoming trip in my RV .Sure enough,in North Carolina my house batteries went dead in my coach lucky for me my 25 ft cables jumped started my coach from my toad vehicle without unhitching it from the coach. Big, time saver! Nice item made in USA too! Most important 4-gauge is best I didnt have to start jumping vehicle to start coach."
32573,2,"This unit will charge deep cycle marine batteries and auto batteries (Wet Cell only). I would not use this on AGM or Gel batteries.Within a year both alligator clips broke under normal use on standard battery terminals. Not good. They told me I had to send the entire unit back both times. Instead of just sending me a new termnal, the girl said that would void the warrenty.Let see , top dollar for the charger itself. 2 UPs shipping charges waiting for the unit to be repaired two times...........I'd look elsewhere before buying this unit again.I hope this is helpful.D.H."
23806,1,"Excellent Product; does what it's advertised to do. Comes with lugs/rings and alligator(battery) clamps and a long cord. Works like a cell phone charger, just connect it & plug it in. WILL NOT WORK ON A COMPLETELY DEAD BATTERY!! (If the battery is dead, use your bulk charger to boost it for a couple of hours and then connect the maintainer.) Once the maintainer reaches full charge, it goes into conditioner mode (green flashing light)which is desulphating the battery, exentending its life. Worth the $$$. [...]"
157052,0,"I got the 21"" and 24"" as a deal and when I replaced my old wipers they worked well originally. Installation is easy, tool free. However, blades started streaking quite a bit after about 3-4 months. I ended up using them for about a year, but the last two months was almost unbearable in terms of streaking."
42702,2,Although this product seems to be rated highly by other buyers it fell way short of my expectations. My van is 5 years old and does not have severe discoloration but this product removed very little of it. I advise using one of the heavier duty products.
138244,2,"I bought this about a year ago and had a chance to use it today.Total Failure.The puncture was small, making it difficult to insert the plug. Finally after it just started to go in, the metal tube on the Dynaplug tool buckled and bent over. The tool simply is not strong enough to work unless the leak is large enough. If they had simply used a stronger tube on the tool, it would have been a great tool. As it is, it is worthless, and you cannot depend upon a tool that breaks so easily when repairing a typical flat.What a waste. Good thing I had my motorcycle tire plug kit with me, as it worked perfectly due to a better design.Very disappointing."
5448,0,"I thought the mirror was just fine, but I don't drive,my son says that it appears to be a carnival mirror. As far as the dilivery of the mirror it arrived on time. I was satisfied but he wasn't."
1131,1,"Anyone who works on a muddy jobsite knows it will track into your truck. Floormats are not enough, if you have an automatic with the shift lever on the steering wheel the hump space is also used extensively. This mat is a clever idea and protects the carpet from mud and coffee spills/stains from cupholders above. No truck is complete without one!!!"
171179,2,I never got it. I was sent the wrong part.I was senrt kc lights.UPS was to stop by and pick it up. But no show.This has been one big pain.Ill never order from amazon again.
65458,1,They have lasted about 4 years. They are extremely comfortable and IMO one of the most important items you could wear when you are riding! I have recommended these to everyone I know!
163515,1,"I bought this belt to replace the one in my 1992 Acura Legend. When I took off the original OEM belt, I could tell this Gates is better. The rubber is actually a blend of nitrite which is more chemical and heat resistant. The price is about the same as my dealership, but I hate dealer with dealerships. Since Gates is OEM for many cars, I trust them."
66332,0,"The All Sales Manufacturing Inc (AMI) fitment showed #6041CL would fit my 2009 dodge ram 1500 but the package I received called for #6042CL. On the AMI website it showed both would fit.To accomplish fitment for the 6041CL I had to elongate one hole on hinge side mount (left-truck body opening) and drill two holes on (right-truck body opening lip). Also, had to remove two parts of the plastic neck liner to accommodate drilling the new holes.Two nuts one at 12-O'clock and 6-O'clock positions had to be ground to allow flush fit on opening recess.Finally the product looks great,after my modifications, but AMI needs to tweak the specifics on application fitment due to differences on model year application.Note to AMI: pkg showed 6041CL to 2008: 2009 showed 6042CL [re: 2009 dodge ram 1500]"
56982,1,"I just came off the freeway, stopped for a quick look in nursery for veggies. Got on my bike and in less than 1 minutes latter I had a flat rear tire (my speed was not more than 25mph) on my bike (Honda VTX 1300). The Good Lord was looking after me! I have had bikes for over 4 years, but I did not have any tools, nor any flat tire fixes,to handle a flat, nor on bike nor at my house! I mainly rode around town on the weekends. What a chore it was to try to borrow a bicycle pump in a neighbor hood near my house. Fortunately home was 12 blocks away, and I drove back with what I thought I needed, just to get the bike home, the fix would come latter a a shop. I'm not going through this again, and so I looked around on the net and ordered, Slime, Slime Compact Tire Plug Kit, Co2 Air Cartridges, and a ""Donor Hose"". I'm glade to say I know I will have most of what I will need (more of God's intervention & the skill to fix a flat)if, and when the next flat hits. (God willing I won't happen again)RM"
173492,2,"Purchased two of these so-called non-slip dash pads so I could have one for each car. Put one on the dash of my Jeep, and it slid off by itself with nothing on it. Tried the other one in the wife's car and it did the same thing. Moved it a little further back on the dash and put my glasses on it thinking that a little weight may help. It didn't. Don't waste your money. Threw mine in the garbage where they belong."
11770,1,This is the third Deltran SuperSmart Battery Tender Plus 12-Volt 1.25 AMP battery charger that I have bought. Great product. Love the electronics that ensure no overcharging.

139118,0,"So, I look on amazon first ...because it's just easier. These plugs were reasonably priced by comparison.I have not bought a set of plugs in quite some time so, I just thought they had increased a lot in price.As it happens , I'm putting a 25 years in storage 1985 Corvette back on the road with only 16k original miles on it. Some other maintainence items required a visit to the local Autozone store and out of curiousity I priced plugs. Well folks, save your money here, these could have been bought ...off the shelf at an impressive savings.The plugs themselves seem fine....just do your homework and comparison shopping.....first."
41321,1,"I had an SUV parked in the cold for a couple weeks and the battery was so drained that it wasn't able to be jumped after 20 minutes of trying to jump start.I thought it was the fuel pump, so was about to tow it to a garage to replace the pump.I got this battery charger, plugged it in at 40 amp charge for about 1 1/2 hours.Then cranked it up to 200amp Jump, letting it build up power for 30 seconds, prayed that this would resolve the problem, then the SUV started with no issues.In the future, I'll keep the battery, ever so often, at the 12 volt maintainer or 10amp minor charge to ensure that I don't get stuck again. Love the timer also, so that you don't overcharge your battery.WOW! I was about to spend $500 on a new fuel pump and to get my truck towed and got this for only $69.99 plus TAX.Hope this review helps.thanks!"

164561,1,"I bought a new car, and ran across these decals in my search for tribal accents for it. I bought 2 and put them in angular positions on my bumper and they are so cute!! They are a durable quality, but you must be careful pulling off paper backing. They were die cut almost all the way around the butterfly. but where they weren't they needed to be trimmed. All and all, good buy!"

98803,1,"I have purchased several pairs of PIAA Xtreme White light bulbs over the past 5 years; 194, 1156 and 1157 style. I'm not sure about the other persons review, but every pair I have bought are a bluish white color. I think they are a good alternative to LED's since you don't need to install resistors to achieve the same color. They do have a pretty dark blue tint but they are pretty bright when lit up. The lower output was slightly dimmer than the factory bulb, but honestly I wouldn't have been able to tell if I didn't have them installed both installed to compare the outputs.The most recent pairs I purchased were for a VW, so I filed off one of the pegs so it would fit. The stock bulbs have pegs at an offset instead of directly across from eachother like 1156 and 1157 style bulbs normally are. The filed off peg method worked pretty well.Also, I haven't had a bulb go out on me while I've owned the car.I'd definitely recommend these to anyone I know. Just look at the reviews for the 1156 Piaa Xtreme White bulb. Plus the price on Amazon is real good. When I bought my first pair from a local shop years ago, I paid over $30."
27078,1,I installed a pair of these plugs in my Harley after reading great reviews about the performance of the plugs. After installing I noticed a slight difference in the performance of my bike. Bike seemed to start and idle better.
123154,2,"This item 45050 is advertised as having a 4"" drop, but upon arrival the label confesses to only a 3.5"" drop. I measured to confirm this fact. This is the correct item identified at multiple vendors as having a 4"" drop, Curt just calls it by the wrong dimension - well let's call a lie a lie.If your tow measurements can allow for 12.5% slop, then this a well-painted, solidly-built 3.5"" drop ball mount.Until they correct the item description/name, I'd suggest you steer clear of Curt and try a more honest brand to get what you order."
56181,1,"I have been using this cover for past 3 months. I always park my motorcycle outside in an open parking. Only problem is that, it does not keep my bike completely dry. When I remove the cover in the morning, I could see water (not to much) on my seat and on the bike itself. It looks like water proof but I am not sure how water gets through the cover. I could have given 5 starts if it was 100% water proof. I always use this cover immediately after riding. I never faced any problem with that. Overall, its a good product. but could have been even better."
20047,1,"What can I say, it is a waterhose. We are using it for a outdoor dogwaterer, so we have not actually tasted the water that runs through it, but the dogs seem pleased! Hard to get too excited about a waterhose in a review, but as waterhoses go, it is a good one!"
44334,0,"Would suggest to replace the AA batteries from the get-go. This item would not work out of the package....removed the back (2 small screws), one battery was out of contact but that did not correct the problem...replaced both batteries and eyed the fuse. Good to go. I do like the wristband feature (frees up both hands). This will do for the price paid but will not buy another.Regards"
96622,0,"The jack does the job required of it, infinitely easier than a scissor jack but a bit of a nuisance to fit the handle in and out of the holder. It is difficult to control the release of air for a slow descent of the jack and the paint was coming off before the first 30 minutes of usage BUT it does lift the car and after a few weeks of use continues to work as well as it did on day 1 and that is all that really matters."

The Bell is a faux leather (which is o.k., but when wet, swells and gets spotty. It will not last long term. The Fox Creek one was super thick real leather, has been on the front of my bike for a few years now and is in great shape with a simple occasional damp rag. I have removed the Bell from the bike."

24770,2,"I previously mounted a Coastal hitch on my 2006 Prius to use with my Hidden Hitch bicycle rack. It was a quick and easy installation. When I sold the 2006 Prius the purchaser made a point of wanting the hitch as part of the deal.I purchased a 2009 Prius new but held off buying another hitch until last week. I found out the Coastal hitch is no longer available so I researched the Curt version. I read the Amazon reviews from 2010 and 2011 and thought ""surely Curt has remedied the problem with the bolt holes not lining up..."" - So I ordered the Curt hitch. It arrived quickly and I was impressed with the shiny black paint/powdercoat finish. I set aside an hour on Saturday afternoon to install it.Well, after removing the cover and propping the hitch into place, I found the spread on the mounting brackets to be about 1/2-3/4 inch too short. I could tell from the heft of the hitch that this was not an easy thing to bend/spread to line up the mounting holes. Almost three hours later, and several failed mounting efforts, I was able to complete the installation. What is sad is I had to use my bench vise to bend the mounting plates and the repeated action (even using a cloth cover) resulted in multiple scratches and gouges that I am sure will rust over time. When I finally was able to mount all four bolts I lowered my arms and just lay on the ground for about five minutes. I physically felt sick to my stomach after the repeated installation attempts.I trust that Toyota builds each Prius with the frame mounting holes in the same position. Why can't Curt craft some type of mounting hole jig to fix their problem? Also, it would have been extremely helpful to include a paper template to show how much of the plastic cover must be removed for the cover re-installation. Not wanting to butcher the cover I wound up with 4-5 test fits before I had removed enough plastic - a marked template would have saved another 30 minutes of installation time.Because so many previous reviews mention the bolt hole spacing problem I assume that Curt has not and will not do anything to improve the quality control of their bolt hole spacing process - I'll close with applauding other reviewers that took their hitches to U-Haul or another vendor and paying $35-40 for the installation. My Saturday evening time is at least worth that much.This hitch is one of few options Prius owners have for light towing and bicycle rack mounting. I suggest potential purchasers of the Curt hitch plan on spending $35-45 additional installation dollars and have a better experience than I did."
49630,1,"I purchased this to check my vehicle after the check engine lite came on. I'm not an mechanic, but I do like to make repairs on my vehicle if I can. Once I received the device, I installed a 9 volt battety, plugged the device in and in less than 5 minutes, I was done. The device scanned the vehicle and determined cylinder 5 was misfiring. I changed my plugs and wires, did a check with the device again and no other issue were found. I would recommend this product to anyone willing to save money on vehicle repairs, is somewhat handy with tools, is an individual with basic knowledge of vehicle repairs, or a seasoned mechanic..."
74594,1,"I bought this Cobra light bar for my 900 Classic LT at Amazon and as unusal, as with most stuff from Amazon, it arrived quickly and well packaged. The price I paid was the lowest I could find. While I was completely satisfied with the product itself, the instructions that Cobra included where where not as detailed as I would have liked. There where no drawings, no explaination as to how the light bar would work after it was installed and a lot of critical steps where left out. These are a few of the problems that I had:1.) the hex head screw on the left side holding the stock Kawasaki light bar was so tight that I had to use a screw extractor to remove the screw. The screw was slightly damaged but I reused it.2.) The alignment of the Cobra light bar to the Kawasaki frame is not perfect. Use extra caution.3.) I had trouble with the quick connector. The first time a connection was not made leading me to believe that I had not wired the bar correctly.When I was finished with the wiring (having followed Cobra's wiring instructions) the lights worked the way I thought they should. The spotlights came on when the headlight came on and stayed on during both high and low beams. The spotlights turned off when the ignition was turned off. The light bar mounted switch can be used to turn the spotlights off but I can't ever imanage using it. Overall I am pleased with the light bar. It certainly allows you to see and be seen easier, just count on it taking most of the day for the installation."
179444,2,"even $250 still too expensive, average sunshine/day 10 hours, than you can get 60w*10*365=219Kw per year, 10years you can get 2190Kw ,if some days rings, you can get the power from the Solar Battery, right now ,per KW power cost about $0.1~$0.15, means after 10years (evey day is sunshine), you still can't get the money back from the Solar Battery."
17554,0,"I used to be a professional mechanic for 11 years, back in the pleistocene age. I have owned OTC tools for 30+ years, and the US made tools are excellent, but this jack is chinese, and even if it's made to OTC's specs, I had to give it a complete going over, before I could put it into service.I opened the box, and it was a disaster inside. Shipping was free, which is great for a heavy item, but if I could attach pics...shredded styrofoam everywhere, and the jack had been banging around loose in the box, clear from China. There was a broken steel clip, which I believe held the lift arm to the frame for a time. This was a disposable piece anyway so...checked thoroughly for damage...jack didn't seem to be bent, or out of true. It comes &#34;completely assembled&#34;, but I had to grind the end of a handle section, so that the 2 halves would fit together. Replaced the grease zerk with one I had, that fit properly. The one that came installed, was the wrong size thread, so the jack wouldn't take grease. Removed the top plate, so I could access the fill plug...oil level was low...topped it up with ATF. Had to block up the heavy end to fill completely. At least a replacement o-ring is included. The rubber contact pad is a little odd...I'd rather have steel against steel (but I'm old), than greasy rubber against steel, so tried to pop off the pad. Just tore the edge of the skirt, and it seems glued on!?!? Went ahead and oiled and greased all wear points, wiped off the styrofoam bits all over it, and vacuumed up the whole mess. Bled the air out of the system. Good setup directions come with. I bought this because it is 2 speed, and that function works well. I use it primarily on my lifted 80 series Land Cruiser so, the tall lift range is what I was after. The 2 ton, $400 Hein-Warner built in the US (Northern Tool) is a much better jack, but then...it's $400. You get what you pay for. Always block up your vehicle with jack stands. This'll serve my home needs just fine for the next 20 years."
171744,2,"My mom has an Olds Alero and I have replaced the window regulators 4 times on different doors. I'm not sure if its the parts suppliers fault or if its General Motors terrible design. I heard Aleros were lemons anyways. The cable always comes off the plastic wheels and gets wrapped and knotted up. I usually don't give bad ratings but after buying 4 of these things and then having them break not even a month later, I just welded a rod inside the door so the window never rolls down again."
79111,1,Excellent product. This is the second one we have purchased. The first one went with our RV when we recently sold it. We purchased another RV and ordered the hose for it.
137860,1,I bought this for my 2003 vw jetta. It fit and works good. Found this to be more cost effective over buying at the dealer and just as good of quality as a factory cabin filter and easy to replace. I like to use Mann filters for my vehicles whenever possible. Quality always seems to be superior.

89004,0,"I live in the South and while I didn't really need a 'monster scraper' it looked great and got good reviews so I bought it. Since the majority of what we experience is a light frost and not a heavy icing of our windows, a lot of the functionality of the IceDozer is wasted. Not only do I not need the ice breaking ribs on the bottom... they actually make it harder to scrape off the frost. What happens is as you scrape, it makes about 20 small scrapes at about 1mm each. There doesn't seem to be enough flex to fully engage the flat portion of the blade, so while it is wide, I have to make just as many passes as I did with our old scraper which was half the width. We did have two ice storms this winter and for the real ice that formed, this thing was a beast. It knocked it out in no time.Bottom line... If you need to scrape off thick ice, this thing is the king of scrapers. However, if you want to scrape lighter frost, you might want to look elsewhere."
28976,2,"Got it today, opened the case and the needle was showing 250 psi. That is hooked up to nothing and never having been hooked up to anything. Tried using it on my jet ski to see if maybe some pressure would get the gauge to zero, or if the needle was just stuck. It moved from 250 to 255. Great, so my jetski holds 250 psi standing still and blows 255 running. hmmmm...? Now I have to wait another two weeks for another gauge to come. I needed this tool and have waited long enough. Whatever."
62943,2,Not so good. This item was way over-priced compared to others offering the exact same item. I would not recommend this item to friends and family! Thank you very much!

Extra performance on a washable filter that will last me for the life of the bike."

125559,1,"We got the tonneau cover and it was super easy to install, it took about 30 minutes tops. It looked great until about 2 hours later the little plastic piece that latches it on broke and it would no longer close. We called the company and they were very friendly and sent us a replacement part immediatly."
183044,0,This is a very good quality filter. Heavy duty. I found out later that this type of filter requires alot of Maintenance.If you don't maintain your filter it can damage your car. You must clean and oil this filter. If you don't oil you filter it can damage your car and if you oil the filter too much it can damage you car. And they sell a special lube/oil just for this type of filter which can be very expencive. Further more there is alot of argument online about no real improvment over a regular paper filter. also I got this filter for around $10 and paid $10 for a paper filter at pepboys.
136815,0,I bought this because it's a reasonable price for neoprene seat covers. When they came in I really liked their feel and they were easy to install. But I discovered I only got the 2 seat covers and the console cover was missing. I contacted Amazon who promptly shipped me out a new set. I opened the box and again the console cover is missing.I've sent back both sets to Amazon for a refund and I'll be buying them from Coverking directly.
165618,0,"APRIL 2012 UPDATE:I ordered this primarily to be a trickle charger/maintenance charger for my Mazda Miata's small battery and to jump start it when needed. Its primary purpose was to be a trickle charger. The jump feature was simply an added bonus, but not necessary. However, for a jump feature I was looking for one that could start a dead battery.The Schumacher SC-8000A Speedcharge Charger/Maintainer is not meant to be used as a 2-amp trickle charger for an automobile, but that was not clear until I received the item and read the instruction manual.My Mazda battery is a small battery by car standards, but per Schumacher's instruction manual for the Model SC-8000A, a ""small"" battery is defined as ""those commonly used in garden tractors, snow mobiles and motorcycles.""By Schumacher standards, my battery is a ""regular""/""larger"" battery and per the instructions, it will charge my Mazda Miata car battery at 12-30 amps, not 2 amps. It is not meant to charge my car's battery at the 2-amp rate. The instructions for the Schumacher SC-8000A Speedcharge Charger/Maintainerinstructions state:""The 2A rate is not intended to be used as a trickle charger for larger batteries.""I am returning it and instead getting theBattery Tender Plus, which with its slow 1.25-amp charge will not harm my car's battery. From speaking with mechanics at the Mazda dealership, it is not a good idea to charge my Miata's relatively small battery (when compared to the size of other car and truck batteries) at a rate of 12 amps to 30 amps. I realize the Battery Tender Plus is not a jump starter, but it is a trickle charger, and I need a trickle charger that won't harm my small battery. A jump starter is not my primary need at this time. The mechanics at the Mazda dealership told me at a 1.25-amp trickle charge will not harm my battery, but they said a 2-amp charge could harm it and so could a 12 amp to 30 amp charge. This is what they told me. Your mechanic may tell you differently, so please check with your mechanic if you have any questions about your particular situation. Your car battery may be just fine with this charger using it as a trickle charger, so please check with your mechanic or the battery manufacturer.Here are the instructions as printed on page 9 of the instruction manual for the Schumacher SC-8000A Speedcharge:~~~~~""CHARGE SET BUTTONUse this button to set the maximum charge rate to one of the following:*SMALL BATTERY: Provides a charge rate of up to 2A. Intended for charging small batteries such as those commonly used in garden tractors, snow mobiles and motorcycles. ***The 2A rate is not intended to be used as a trickle charger for larger batteries.****REGULAR BATTERY: Provides a charge rate of up to 12A-30A depending on the battery. Use for charging normal or large batteries. Not intended for industrial applications.""~~~~~Other things I noticed about this product: I mention a couple of these points for people who aren't mechanically oriented. If you are the least bit mechanically oriented, you won't have any problem.1. To operate the Schumacher SC-8000A Speedcharge Charger/Maintainer, you must know what kind of battery you have. The SC-8000A has 4 settings: 12V Regular, 12V Deep Cycle, 12V AGM/Gel, and 6V Regular. My Miata battery is a 12V AGM/Gel. A lot of you probably know what type of battery you have. If you don't know, you may have to do a little research. With theBattery Tender Plus, (for those of you only looking for a trickle charger and no jumper) no research is necessary. Just connect the positive and negative clamps to your battery and you are set. If all you are looking for is a trickle charger, which in my case was the most important thing, then this turned out to be a good solution for me.2. When using the Schumacher SC-8000A, if it is a negative-grounded system, you connect the red (positive) output clamp to the positive post, but the negative clamp *cannot* and *must not* be connected to the negative post. You have to connect the negative clamp to, according to the SC-8000A's instructions, ""a heavy, unpainted metal part of the chassis or engine block, away from the battery."" And ""DO NOT connect clamp to negative battery post, carburetor, fuel line or sheet metal part."" Since my Miata's battery is located in the trunk, near no engine parts nor other metal parts, there is nothing to clip the negative clamp onto besides the trunk, which I can't do since it cannot be connected to a ""sheet metal part."" There is nothing else for the negative clamp to be connected to in my trunk. Most people won't have this problem; it may be unique to Miatas and a few other cars.3. This Schumacher product is larger and heavier than I anticipated. TheBattery Tender Plusis extremely small and lightweight. If you end up just wanting a trickle charger, and both are options, this may matter to you.4. IMPORTANT NOTE: ***For those who want to use this to jump a completely dead battery, per a Schumacher representative, it can be done using the following steps:A. Connect charger to battery.B. Hold down the charge rate button. While you hold this down, plug the charger in to electrical power source.C. Let the button go once the charger is plugged in.D. This sets it in ""manual mode."" Leave it on Manual Mode for about 2-3 minutes.E. Unplug from electrical power source (while leaving it still connected to battery).F. Replug back in to electrical power source. The surge inside will activate the charging mode in a completely dead battery.Please see attached photos of the size difference between the Schumacher SC-8000A Speedcharge Charger/Maintainer and the Battery Tender Plus."
841,0,I am at a loss for finding twenty words to describe a product that performs as advertised for my intended use. Please update your guide indicating that this locking cap works on a 2011 Toyota Tacoma.
129451,1,They went on wiyh out any problems and have ben doining just fine .The price was a big part of me getting them from Amazon .If you need parts check hear first!!
163468,2,"I had previously ordered the same product which did not work, could be something still wrong with the car causing the problem. I ate the cost and decided to order another part. my thought was it could be my car, it could be their part. went ahead and ordered another part. when the part arrived, it was in an extremely extended state and would not correct. upon further investigation I found the problem with the item. It had broken in transport. this is an understandable situation as it was shipped in only a padded envelope. when I contacted the seller, (this is where the real problem began) I was asked by the seller, in a nice way, &#34; to please take a picture of the part and send it back to them before they would refund for the part&#34;. Amazon replied with go ahead and return the part for a refund, I was issued, almost immediately a return label. If amazon had not intervened, I would have lost all faith in them. Amazon did the right thing in my opinion, but I will not be ordering another part from this company. ( I was also expected to pay for the return shipping). poor service!!"
38531,1,"I was skeptical when I first saw this product to fix a bullseye I had on my windshield. Then, because of the majority of positive reviews, I went ahead and ordered it to give it a try. It's difficult to mess up when doing the repair! My wife feels confident enough to do it now that she's seen me do it! The hardest part was lining up the repair/delivery device over the divet. Once this is done, it is easy as pie. Just plop a couple drops in the tube and screw in the pressure cap and it delivers a majority of the fluid to the affected area. I did use a heat gun to help deliver more of the product to the outlying cracks (as recommended in the instructions). After doing this and removing the delivery device, you put a couple more drops on the remaining chip (all the cracks are gone at this point) and put a ""curing strip"" over it and set it out in the sun. Scrape off the strip and remaining material after a few minutes. I will admit that you can see a small spot where the chip is, but it's a helluva lot better than paying $300+ for a new windshield or even paying $60+ for a windshield repair! This product lets you do it at home and on your own time. All you need is a shady place to start the procedure and sun to finish/cure the product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
103397,0,What you are getting is only the valve not the complete bypass kit. The picture is misleading if you don't catch from the description that it is just the valve in the lower left corner of the picture; my mistake.
151718,2,This would have worked great if it fit nicely but it would have taken way too much time to modify to get it looking like a factory option. Ended up just fabricating a mount into the pillar and color matching it with SEM paint. Cleaner look and the same amount of work it would have been just to make this product look acceptable.
27193,1,This product is awesome. It looks great! It has a rubber seal around the bottom of the lid so it fit better and sealed better than the stock lid! The chrome is high quality as you would expect from edelbrock!!!

The product itself is great.The recommended item in the add (the grease gun) is for different cartriges as noted in one of the other reviews."

137477,2,"Amazon says that these valve stem seals will fit on a 1993 Dodge Stealth ES DOHC. Note: This does NOT fit a DOHC engine. I took my car to the dealer to have them install these vavle stem seals but they were not able to because these only fit the SOHC model. Do not get this product if you are looking to replace your valve stem seals on your DOHC Stealth/3000GT. I understand that this product sells in sets of 12 and not 24 which should have been a tip off to me but usually for DOHCs you buy per head so it was not unusual. The Engine model listed on Amazon to fit this product is ""3.0L V6 Gas DOHC Distributorless Naturally Aspirated SFI Electronic FI MFI""; note the DOHC piece which is what I relied on.This is not the only time Amazon.com has been wrong with what fits my Dodge Stealth. I had a similar issue with the thermostat. I will find it difficult to purchase auto parts from Amazon going forward."

Within a year of installing this guard (which is a bear, getting the bolts to line up) the paint started chipping off. I started touching it up using Rustoleum paint but the chipped areas kept getting larger and larger. Recently very large sheets of paint have been coming off so I'm looking at removing the guard, stripping it down, treating any rust and totally refinishing it. This time I'll be using Rustoleum primer and finish coat(s). I would suggest any buyer of this guard refinish it before installing."
117230,1,"SOAG is great for vinyl shutters; restored mine to like-new! I don't know how long the restoration will last, but if it is for at least a year, it beats painting or replacing them. Also, the price is very reasonable; a comparable product in a brick and mortar store costs twice as much."

81529,0,The rubber protector is a nice to have addition but it's a bit of a pain to install. You have to unscrew the hose from the gauge (wrenches required) and it's a tight fit - some type of lubricant (e.g. a little diluted liquid soap) will help. I used teflon tape (the stuff used for plumbing fixtures) when reattaching the hose - works well and is better than whatever was used at the factory.

115899,1,"well to start off, before i used this product i read all the review, i was kind of hoping to get feed back on specific cars but no luck. seeing how im pretty sure theres someone like myself ill note the cars that i have tried this on.97 honda accord95 bmw 325i95 honda preludethe bmw was the worst one, only because thats the one i caused to fail. i was told to replace a hose and expansion tank and... well i didnt. started overheating and i couldnt get off the freeway so i ran it on the red for what seemed like 10 minutes. although i will note i guess there are different stages of a blown h.g. mine have never had coolant mixed with the oil or at least not noticeable. it has always been coming out the exhaust. ive read some of the negative reviews and i wonder if they followed the directions to the tee. i think 2 of the procedures that get overlooked.1. drain all the anti freeze. i mean flush everything for those that have had failure i wonder if you turned the heater on and ran the motor for a bit to make sure theres no anti freeze in the heater core.2. seems small put your supposed to pour in slowly, 30 seconds if your only using half the bottle and 60 secs if you require the whole bottle.i live in sunny california, i have driven all of these cars in the heat, with the a/c on and havent had an issue with the blue devil itself, however another note is i got lazy on the accord and never replaced the thermostat or antifreeze on it. and i believe the lack of lubrication from the antifreeze my water pump gave out. but once i replaced that i was good.for all of you that are about to try this, i definetly think its worth it. but read the instructions and follow it precisely. flush the engine, heater core, radiator like your life depended on it. that will increase your chances greatly. good luck."

108932,2,"I purchased a pair of these in March 2009 from Amazon. There was a rebate so the price wasn't terrible. That is about the best news.The light output was not notably higher than the standard halogen bulbs in my Maxima. 10 months later, one has already burned out. The product packaging warns of short life. What it doesn't warn is that the product, at least to my perception, doesn't provide much more light from a standard bulb in real world situations.My headlight bulbs aren't difficult to change but I wouldn't put these things in again if someone gave them to me. Just not enough more light...even IF the life of the bulb was decent."
178720,1,"These wiper blades clean the car windows much better than the stock rubber blades. Since I have just purchased them I can't vouch for the longevity of the blades or how they'll hold up to the hot Florida sun but I expect them to do very well. The wiper arms and blades come with every adapter you might need to fit your car and are fairly easy to install. At first glance they might seem fairly expensive but they should last 3 to 5 times longer than normal blades and should be more resistant to cracking and tearing since they're made of silicone. They can be purchased in different colors and are also available with color matching wiper arms. These blades are sold individually, not in sets which may be a good thing since quite a few of the newer cars have blades of different lengths. Best of all they're made in the U.S.A."

19358,0,"This product is not perfect. One of the fake logs was broken in shipment and could not be replaced as the vendor buys it from China, no extra logs included. However, it provides a cheerful area where people can gather. It takes a lot of propane. The tank connection hardware that is included should fit all 2 to 20 gal. propane tanks. We had to buy a special adapter to make it fit the small camping canister that lasts for an evening on low flame, or about 2 hours if we wanted it to really look like a campfire. It seems well made and should be durable."
111219,1,"Best Wiper I've ever owned, these work just as they are described. Giving you clear vision and no stripes across your wind shield.

128692,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
50919,0,"The Rear View Mirror works fine once it was on but the clips had to be forced to make it fit over my (pretty standard sized)regular mirror because it was too large for them. If the clips had been another 1/4 or 1/2 inch longer I would have rated it at 5 stars. As it was, it was a real hassle forcing it to get it to fit and worrying about what I might break."
71471,1,"I heard a lot of this a few years ago and decided to try it out myself. Like the other users wrote, the paint is smoother than a baby's butt after you're done with it. And I'd bet my car that it was better than when I drove the it off the lot simply because most cars sit out in the open for a while before they get sold.The only problem is that it took me 8 hours to do the entire car. I guess if you wait too long in between clay barring, it takes a while to get all the crud off. If you do it more often, maybe twice a year, it should probably take less time.For your reference, I have a Subaru Impreza. Now to try it on my 92 Miata whose paint has oxidized rather badly."
104089,0,"Though this particular set of vent visors LOOKS nice and adds some extra character to the vehicle overall, they aren't too great for practical use. There are two problems w/ them in my opinion, one that I see as a shortcoming in design, the other one a nearly unavoidable issue that I'd imagine one encounters w/ just about any set of vent visors. The first problem is that they just aren't big enough; big enough in regards to how far down from the top of the window they extend; and the ""angle"" they protrude from the vehicle is too extreme--and these two issue combine to create a vent visor that realistically only allows one to open a window less than of an inch before rain and such starts coming in as though there's no visor at all. In my opinion, if they either went down farther and/or were designed to follow the line of the window a bit more, they'd be far more effective. The other problem, the one I feel is pretty much unavoidable across the board, is that the wind from the vehicle moving blasts rainwater that's on the window/door/side mirror up the glass and into the passenger compartment regardless of the vent visor--but, like I said, I'd imagine that that would be the case regardless of how the visor was designed."
46207,2,"The wires are so long in this set, my engine could be about 2 more feet behind the distributor and they would still reach. I had to coil them up around the strut adjustment bolt to get them out of the way. The boots are so large, they barely fit on the cap, and there is no play to position them to route the wires in a clean and neat fashion."

172930,2,"Okay folks, I wasted no time giving a review on these headlight bulbs. You need to be warned about products like this.Why? Because it's a total joke for believing hype like this: ""Sylvania XtraVision 65-Watt High Performance Halogen Headlight delivers three times more foreground illumination which is designed to create up to 20% more strong illumination"" (etc)I changed my 2 headlights today, in my 1990 Camry, in hopes of improving my night field of vision. I could hardly wait until it got dark to test them. Five hours after nightfall, I took a 5 mile drive, including various streets lit at different levels - some with no street lights at all.Let me tell you, I was NOT happy whatsoever! I feel that I totally wasted my money. These bulbs are no brighter than my stock headlight bulbs - not a bit, none, nada, zip. So how can Sylvania make such outrageous claims, or in my opinion .. lies?Go ahead and waste your money, if you wish. Find out on your own. Besides, another reviewer here says they're great. Maybe he works for Sylvania. Maybe he stopped wearing sunglasses at night. (wow, I can see!) Maybe he's lost his mind. Maybe he reported on the wrong series bulb.I saved my original bulbs and won't bother with returning these. (difficult to change in a Toyota) Sorry to disappoint, but truth and facts are what I deal in.Cheers to all,Jeff"
76371,1,"Works well. Have reasonable expectations -- it uses a 15 watt bulb so don't expect it anywhere near the power of an electric outlet powered light. It works well enough for small areas, however, which is all i needed it for. Motion sensor is nicely adjustable such that I could get it to exclude the dozens of numerous wandering cat's from triggering it. The only downside is the solar panel doesn't have a external frame included to mount on, which was a bummer since I mounted the light under a ceiling recess where minimal sunlight would reach, meaning I needed to separate the solar panel. However, my detached garage roof is flat, so I needed to custom build a mounting frame so the panel could be mounted at an angle to the south (most optimal position for a panel) to get maximum sunlight capture and prevent issues of trapped water sitting on the panel after a rainfall.Edit: After 6 months, the unit is working flawlessly. I've never experienced any problem with the motion sensor failing or a lack of available power. It simply just works in the background without me ever thinking of it. Great unit.Edit 2: It's been well over a year since I've installed this unit and it continues to perform like new. The only ""false on's"" I've had were doing very strong gusty rainstorms and fortunately those are quite rare.Edit 3: It's now been over 2.5 years since I've installed the unit and guess what? It still works as good as the first day! Brightness and duration of battery life appear fine. I realize the battery will probably need to be changed within the next year or two but so far so good. All I can say is that this is a GREAT device. But keep in mind I installed this unit properly to ensure the maximum amount of sunlight reaches the panel."
3752,1,"This cover is doing the basic cover job I needed this summer for my RVon a Ford 350. The suction cups work in the heat of the summer althoughsome previous reviewers wrote that they didn't work for the winter. I dowish that the cover was a bit wider top to bottom to completely cover fromthe top of the windshield to the grill work below the windshield wipers. I don't know how well this thin cover would hold up to winter's heavy ice/snow conditions but all I wanted was to protect the windshield when my RV is parked for prolonged periods. For the price, its working."

68245,0,"I expected a dramatic difference from the stock Sylvania bulbs. I didn't get it. The brand is the best. I expect them to last. The brightness is better, but I don't see how they are extreme white. The bulb glass is clear. They hardly cast a super illuminating beam as I thought they would."
108842,0,"I gave this tool a three star. It would have been a five star but, I had to weld it back together after the first use. I would recommend this tool but, I would throw some welds on before you use it. It's a time saver."
764,2,I purchased these in June of 2009 and installed them on my truck to give my truck more support to haul my 31ft. 5th wheel. Today 6/13/2011 a 6 inch piece of one of the leaf spring helpers broke off while I was driving down the road. Lucky for me and other traffic it happened while I was on a less traveled road and only going about 25 mph. These leaf spring helpers are only 2 years old and they broke. I guess they are not made of quality steel. I don't recommend them.

132407,0,I recently purchased a 6002PRO ssystem to install in a friends car. I used to install car electronics professionally so installation was clear and easy. The instructions manual plus a wiring diagram from the Bulldog website was very helpful. The system worked fine for 1 day and then sounded off at 5:00am for no reason and on a long drive the system sounded while driving. After that the system would no longer work so I sent it back for repair by Bulldog and they do not pay for shipping to them.They give you another remote worth $20.00 for your trouble and time. So I wonder if the Quality is poor on their systems or am I just the lucky one person out of a thousand. I hope your luck is better than mine.
88307,0,"I bought this roof rack as appose to getting a $200-300 Thule or similar to save money. The crossbars are about the only good thing about it. The feet are cheap plastic and the rubber boots are not attached, the entire assembly just sits on them and even then they aren't sturdy. The rack is held down solely by thin straps that attach to the door gutter by hooks that don't grip anything due to their ""L"" shape rather than a ""V"" shape, so they easily slip off when the door is open. I bought this for my 1997 Dodge Caravan, but the hooks will not fit the door sills. It does, however, fit my 2002 Dodge Intrepid fairly well. The rack also makes an awful lot of wind noise (howling) while driving anywhere above 50mph. I taped the holes in the crossbars thinking that is what was causing it, but didn't make any difference. The hollow feet is likely the culprit. It's not terrible, but not good for a long journey. My last complaint is the instructions... although assembly is easy without them, they are completely incomprehensible. Be sure to strap the feet before attaching the crossbars. Overall, a cheap way to carry light and low profile cargo for short distances... anything else you'll be better off buying the more expensive brands that are made for your particular vehicle."
64554,1,The product description was accurate. Everything I hoped it would be. Install was easy and it fit like a glove. I can definitely feel a increase in performance. There's no going wrong with this air filter.

172711,0,"My first impressions as I opened the shipping box were quite positive. The packaging was neat and the knob itself was sitting on microfiber-like cloth. Taking it out of the box, it had good weight, hue and luster. The manufacturers clearly take pride in their product.When I went to install it, however, I ran into some annoyances. Rather than having steel-threaded adapters, the shifter comes with threadless plastic tube inserts which are meant to be screwed down onto the threads making a snug (and in my case crooked) fit. To compound this issue, there is an aluminum retainer which seems to have difficulty staying in place.It looks good on top of my short shifter, but the retainer has a tendency to vibrate off if not tightly screwed in, due to the vibration (and hard shifts.) Threadlocker may be the only solution.It looks good but does not offer any performance advantage over the (in my application) weighted OEM shift knob. I wouldn't drive anywhere without the OEM knob in the car. Is it nice? yes. Is it worth $40? It would be with steel threaded adapters."
26426,1,"Ok so I lock my keys in my car on a monthly basis and after having to walk home in the rain I decided to purchase one of these. I drive a Kia and my key folds in (which makes it really fat) and I thought that getting the extra large one would be big enough, but it wasn't. This will pretty much fit a standard sized car key. However, I got a copy made of my key in a more petite model and the product now functions perfectly. I even bought one for my friend."

Now the motion sensor work only when it feels like or it comes on and instantly goes dull and starts a struggling sireen sound, even though the sireen is off. The motion sensor is the worst part of this device and there seem not to be a replacement just for the motion sensor portion of the device. Customer service is not good from this company either. Not worth it. They need to fix the motion sensor on the device."

181724,0,"This model is an attractive replacement for older 12 volt lights or if you wish to add an additional light to either a truck or an RV. I bought three to replace existing lights within my RV. They look nice although I am not a fan of the bulbs that come with them. Word of warning on Progressive Dynamic's lights - their switches SUCK. First, despite having two bulbs on the light the switch only has an ON/OFF position; it is not a three position switch (in order to choose one side or both). Secondly, the switch is the bottom of the bottom in quality. First of the three light switches was dead on arrival. The second died within three weeks. The third (it's been able 90 days now with very limited use) is starting to go too. That means my entire order was defective. Manufacturer is unwilling to resolve the issue. Disappointing and unprofessional.Save your original screws if you are replacing an older light. There are no screws with Progressive Dynamic lights. If you have to buy screws, be cautious if you are installing the lights in an RV ceiling; you don't want to choose a screw that goes right through your roof. Also keep in mind that these lights are smaller than models of 10 years or older, so be prepared to spend a bit of extra time on painting the now unconcealed open areas. The plastic covers are weak, so be gentle when removing them.Although I would not recommend it if you don't know what you are doing or if you only have limited knowledge, the switches can be replaced with a far better three position switch (or simply a new ON/OFF switch). The sucky side to this option is that buying new switches costs half of what the light itself costs. Again, PD does make a hard to find attractive light, but I'd recommend either choosing a different manufacturer or knowing what you are doing in order to maintain it. Other than that, it looks great."

167106,1,"Denso is a direct fit for your Chrysler vehicle. Only problem is that Amazon said this would work for the upstream sensor on my 1996 Dodge Ram truck. It is not Amazons fault because all other Auto Parts websites said the same thing. I ordered it and found out it is about 2 inches too short. It has a wire length of 12 inches. My original is about 14 inches long. I found out that there is an alternate part of 234-4076. It is the exact same part but it has a 18 inch wire length with the same pigtail (it was another option I could of used but did not know about). The 234-4076 fit great and works great also. I loved the extra 4 inches of wire to work with. If you don't have the option of taking out your original and measuring the wire length, order the 234-4076. You can thank me later!"

The order did get to me in time, but much to my dismay it was for mounts only.. leaving me to scramble to find some somewhere locally. The response from the seller was polite, but said that the ""part # listed is indeed correct and is only being the 1 1/4"" clamp-on mounts"". I was supposed to know their part #s?

Since I am not a professional mechanic I figured it was 50/50 that either I installed it wrong, or got a bad pump. I should have realized it was the pump considering how it was packaged. Looked like it had been dropped in the box with greasy rags for packing. Fresh black spray paint on it so I figured it was packed in haste.Drove without power steering until I had time to get it into the dealer. They put a good pump in and boy what a difference. They also confirmed that THIS pump was either not remanufactured, or was not remanufactured properly. The seal in the back of the pump was bad.No warranty info on this one either.

One less thing to clean!I am even happier with it since I started using the Coleman portable toilet deodorizer with it-- now there is no odor even when I am emptying it. I used to dread that job, even though it is not used for ""solids"".If I have any complaint at all, it would be that it is pretty hard to close the blade that empties the waste into the holding tank without making enough noise to disturb anyone sleeping nearby-- it makes a kathunk as it closes up tight."
32575,2,"This was very tempermental, often giving an error message that something is wrong with the battery. I tried it on the same battery yesterday, and got three different messages in 3 consecutive tries. Saying battery was full, then a bad cell, and finally not connected. I tried it on 2 other cars which were both less than 3 years old, and both had ""bad"" batteries. I never did get my battery charged. There has to be better choices."
135716,1,"I use to keep a Leatherman squirt on my keychain, but even being so small it was a little hefty for a two-key keyring. Enter the Utili-key. It's not much bigger than a large key while containing quite a few useful features. I use it frequently because it's always at my side. I'm most surprised that I use the little flat screwdriver quite often. It's small enough for small screws, and it's pretty tough.I agree with other reviewers that it's a little hard to open, and you have to watch the blade, but I haven't cut myself yet (and I'm usually prone to it).As tough as it is, there must've been a flaw in the metal, and the little arm (with the little screwdriver) broke off when I dropped my keys on the carpet! Surprising after what I put it though up to that point. HOWEVER Swiss Tech customer service was quick and friendly, and upheld their warranty.This is a great company, and a handy tool for your keyring. Don't expect it to work miracles, but it's great tool to always have at your side."
131652,2,"Very disapointed. This cover will not fit a Harley Davidson. It may fit a small sport bike but should not say ""cruiser model"". I am very disapointed. This cover only fits Half of my Dyna ""Low rider"". the x-large fits my ""Street glide"" just fine so i was very surprised. would not recomed this size for anyone who has anything but a scooter!"
176231,0,"I measured it at 500 feet in the dark. It is clearly visable. But headlights will wash it out as some point as a car approaches it. And if there are lights beyond your vehicle it may get lost. However, it is inexpensive and certainly better than leaving your emergency blinkers on if you are going to be away for long enough for them to drain your battery. I wouldn't buy just one per vehicle. I'd buy several. The magnetic feature is very handy. But the key is getting your vehicle off the road as far as possible so emergency lighting is not as important. If you can't I'd use emegegency flashers and get back to your vehicle ASAP. And forget about using this during the day. You can't see it from far enough away to avoid an accident."
86780,0,"I have been commuting on this product for about 6 weeks now. It performs pretty well, but is inconsistent in how well it cools your seat and back, and sometimes seems I need to shift around a little bit in order to get airflow to some areas. Since Phoenix summertime temps often exceed 110F, it is a pretty extreme test of any product to work well. That being said, it would be nice to have more power from the fan, as it is difficult to tell it is on sometimes, until I have been driving for 10-15 minutes. My wife finds the stiffness of the unit uncomfortable. When I get home from my 20 minute commute, my backside is definitely dryer , so that is a plus.Pluses:1. Makes a difference, even in hot Phoenix summer2. Variable speed, though I always keep it on max3. Beige matches my car fairly wellMinuses:1. Could really use more power2. Seems to crush sometimes, restricting flow to some regions3. Pretty stiff, so uncomfortable for some drivers"
79786,2,"This replacement wiper does NOT fit 1997 Ford Explorer rear wiper arm. It may be 14 inches, but the mount on this blade is the traditional hook mount, while the rear wiper arm on the 1997 Ford Explorer (and possibly many other model years) is a pin mount - a snap clip in the wiper secures it to the pin, not a hook. This does not fit a 1997 Ford Explorer at all, front or rear as advertised."
60854,2,K&N makes great air filters. This post is more about amazon. Make sure you double check your motorcycles correct fit on K&N web site. Amazon lets products in the search criteria that are wrong even if you type in everything specific to your bike.
94966,2,"The Warn units do not have the quality of the US made units at this price point. In fact, Columbus McKinnon units can be had for slightly cheaper price. Here they are compared:-Made in China (Warn) vs US (CM)-Painted finish (Warn) vs galvanized (CM)-lower load rating (4-3/4 ton for Warn vs 6-1/2 ton for CM)Warn needs to price these along the lines of Smittybuilt and other Chinese sourced shackles."
109074,0,the frist problem was the bumper was not silver like adverticed it was power coated gray. the second problem was only two of the four holes would line up.had to drill the other two.
125614,0,"This product was needed in my 4.0 L /Aw4 conversion in my Scrambler for the extension. It works well. Would be great to come with a boot and a shift pattern sticker. Not as smooth as I might want it to be , but thats a Dana 300 for ya."
181466,1,This stuff's been working great in my car. Amazon has great prices like always!
92507,2,"High quality filter, very tight fit and near impossible to remove without damaging it. No doubt it works but very hard to get out of try."
128404,1,Clips fit on my Tacoma perfectly. It came with new plastic pads which fit perfectly. Now I can mount my yak.
25389,1,Install was a breeze and they ride great. Arrived on time and best price I could find them for. Great buy.....
71329,1,My husband purchased this here since we could not find it locally. He knew it would help put a beautiful shine on my 1999 Miata.
29141,0,it works well but it does not have as good of a seal as the oem filter
37481,1,Got it fast hope it does it's job if necesary wanted to make sure my vehicle is pertected the best it could be.
137452,0,"Quality of the glove is above and beyond, which makes you feel safe in case you were to go down. However, the comfort department is a satisfactory. During prolonged riding, my throttle hand starts to cramp, I guess from the glove being brand new and not broken in. Also, given that they are leather gloves, my hands start to sweat while riding in warm weather, which makes it difficult to take the gloves off and put them on. Other than that, I would have to say that these aren't bad at all."
76039,2,"The problem is that there is no slots for the lower part of your licence plate to slide into, therefore when you tighten the top fasteners it sticks out from the plate. If you loosen it up then it rattles. It looks good, but I am looking for another."
99624,1,"I stuck this in place of the injector from #4 cylinder on my 1996 Mercury Villager. It was packed plenty secure and had a warning I wish had come with another injector I purchased a couple years ago from another website. It's in #5 right now. The o-ring should be lubricated and the injector should go into the fuel rail with only a modest push and twist. The o-ring on a earlier purchase was the correct diameter but was too fat. I noticed the difference but tried to use it anyway since I figured the rebuilder must know what they're doing. If not for good plug wires I would have had an engine fire due to a fuel leak after a few hours of run time. If the injector don't go in nicely then something ain't right.If you are wondering if you have a bad injector then maybe you need a mechanic's stethoscope for around $12.00 it is a must have. With the engine running and probing against the retainer cap, a dead injector has a hun hun hun sound and one that's working goes thick thick thick."
58565,1,"I could not find this in previous reviews, and the product information on this was less than helpful. I ended up buying one box because it was not clear to me how many clips came in a box. The answer is two - at least for the Q128. I haven't installed on my VW CC yet, as I now have an order in for a second box. Anyway - submitted this feedback to Amazon. Note that the box clearly indicates a pair once you get it; however the generic picture on the site doesn't (understandably you get a generic image since there are a multitude of models)."
108937,2,"These bulbs appear both whiter and brighter than the two Sylvanias I replaced. I have edited this review because one of the bulbs burned out after only a few weeks. Amazon sent a replacement package, but I had already installed another brand. So the jury is still out on this one."
149156,1,"There sure isn't much to say in a review for an item like this. It arrived very quickly, and was easy to install. All the parts lined up perfectly and the door opens rapidly."
117394,2,My husband used these on the center console of his Hyundai Sante Fe and it removed the color. Now there is a huge brown spot in the gray finish. Use with caution and test an inconspicuous area first!
60984,1,"I've been using this for over a year, more than 10k miles without any issues. I think the ECM (engine computer) adjusted itself to accommodate the increased airflow after a couple weeks because the car definitely has more power. The improvement was about as drastic as replacing mildly dirty spark plugs, or wires, etc.This filter seats perfectly in my OEM housing. The silicone gasket around the edges ensure that all the air flowing in is filtered, and no gaps appear around the edges. It's perfect.Very happy with the K&N; air filter. I even put one in my fiancee's new Kia so we could save $90 air filter changes at the dealership. It won't void your warranty, and K&N; will argue on your behalf if a dealership says it does.Totally worthwhile, I have not seen any drawbacks or negative results from this."
121221,0,ok so I see a lot of 5 star reviews but honestly this was is just ok..... its a cheap wax goes on just like any wax and assuming you don't let it bake on the car it comes off fine. im always shopping around for different waxes saw a couple good reviews on this so I thought I would give it a try.the applicator it comes with is crap toss that if you plan on buying this and use your own . this wax has no real scent that it puts off which is something that I dislike I currently use a meguires and it has a very nice scent it puts off for a day or 2 depending if I park in the garage. as far as durability I used this during a month with average 75 degree with about 7 days of rain scattered throughout the month and this wax does not have the capability to last past 2 which is disappointing but it is a wax under 10$the finish on the car did not have that great of a shine compared to meguires I have now but others may have there opinion on there own wax job. this is just a mediocre review for a mediocre wax.p.s I am not a meguires fan boy I just prefer there wax AT THE MOMENT it may change when I run out of the can I have now and start shopping for another
124154,2,"I ordered this mirror for an '02 E-350, and it's suppose to fit fine. The picture shown matches the mirror that my van needs, but the mirror they sent me only works for vans from years 92-00."
106337,0,"It could have just been the kind of car I have, but I couldn't get the bag to stick to anything. My car gets REALLY hot inside during the summer (which is when I bought this), and the velcro just wouldn't stay stuck on my dashboard, or anywhere else. It still serves its purpose, but it floats around in my car instead of staying where I wanted it. Now, it does have a strap to tie it to the headrest, but I have seat covers, so that didn't work. Wouldn't recommend this if you really need it to stick to something or have seat covers, but other than that, it's a nice product."
136725,2,"I had misplaced my key for this lock and took a simple household hammer to see if I could get the lock off. To my amazement, 1 simple swing from the hammer and the lock popped off. Do not purchase this lock. I would recommend the California Immobilizer."
104398,0,"Instruction misleading, incorrect, had to to a shop, one ring would lock the wheel, so one ring less! , seems wrong...."
110872,1,"Tired of squeaky wiper blades that streak? These are the answer to your headaches. Very streamline, easy to install, and the best wiper blades on the market today!"
6132,1,The right size. Make sue to buy two. These are alot safer than what i used to use. I didnt want to spend the money at first but i am glad now
185647,1,"Cheep charger, but it works well. It is nice being able to use a 110v wall outlet or a 12v car outlet. Light changes from red to green when charging is complete."
113858,2,The mats shown in the ad vs the mats I received are not the same. As I indicated in an earlier review the mats shown have eyelets for securing to the floor of the vehicle. My car 2010 Cadillac DTS has the catches in the floor for the mats with the eyelets. The mats I received do not have that feature. They tend to move and not be stationary.
93542,1,Picked up a nail just last weekend and I was very happy to have this pump in my trunk. It sure beats using a hand pump or not being able to roll at all.
128022,0,"like alot of people in life just not very bright,they work, they're red,and they are leds so for what you pay not bad."
173882,2,You can wrap the filter with the strap but cannot tighten it. Waste of $$
13756,0,fits my saturn but no way to attach the cable so that i wont forget it in the gas station when filling.
29797,0,Product arrived with glass broken on air pressure gauge. The manufacturer's packaging isn't sufficient to protect the product in shipping (seller shipping packaging was fine).The Ford reservoir adapter's rubber o-ring was too big; it would snag the sides when trying to push the adapter down on the reservior. Replaced it with one size smaller and now it works fine.
82884,2,"I bought this after amazon did their ""vehicle check"" it came up that it fits.. i received it, went to put it in and it did not fit.. then went to ATP's website and this was not the product that fits.. not happy with the purchase"
140408,1,This cream polish goes on easy and buffs out to a brillant shine. It really makes M-Benz wheels shine and removes water spots and brake dust.
42097,2,"Somehow when I searched for a wiper blade refill for my 1996 Chrysler Town and Country , Amazon's search took me to this Wiper Blade . Well , I finally got around to putting it on and it IS THE WRONG WIPER REFILL for my Town And Country . I guess I got SCREWED AGAIN ! ! Amazon needs to do some work on their search engine ! !"
128566,1,difficult to find the wires for the transmission but once found it installed in no time. you can feel it kick in when revving to higher RPM's. worth the money for sure
156943,2,I bought these hoping that being Bosch wipers they would perform. Unfortunately they chatter way too much and I missed the return window from Amazon or they would be going back. I highly recommend the Rain X Latitude blades. Easy install and they move effortlessly across the glass.
110198,1,Have a 27 ft class C ordered the 23-26 fit perfect. Material feels thicker than the other covers I had. Prior covers I ordered were 27-29 too big. So far so good.
112085,0,"At the time of purchase, the product description says it fits a 2012 Hyundai Elantra. I have a 2013 model and decided to take a chance that Hyundai did not make any changes to the wheels.The wheel locks look too different from the standard wheel bolts, so they are sort of conspicuous. The design of the key makes it difficult to apply enough torque when tightening the wheel locks. I am still wary of earlier comments from other users that the multiple wheel locks they received shared the same key."
130989,1,"Worked just fine, delivered on time. It just seems that they are not that much stronger than the ones I replaced. They are easy to replace if you take a few minutes to logic out how to change them. I'd also recommend propping up your lift gate with a 2x4 when you take one off."
94485,0,"Works great for my Tundra, but my wife's Honda Civic doesn't have enough weight to hold the ramps down and prevent them from sliding around while trying to get on them. Quality is good, but without the weight and decent gripping feet they become a challenge for some vehicles."
110053,1,some of us have larger skulls than others and it is a very tight fit. It almosts starts to perform a facelift which could be an added benefit.Great for the price and the vendor was very supportful in questions.thanks again
81413,1,This is by far the best leather cleaner that I have tried. It simply does what it says. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good leather cleaner.
156759,0,"Definitly just the product it's a high quality item look good and I hope with the time my concept about it dont change,in the other hand the packaging it's a disaster I buy two of this and I received two packages when perfectly fit in just one wich means that I had to pay extra charge for the shipping"
10440,2,"The picture of this gage on Amazon suggests it has dual chucks, and is heavy duty. The s921 is a small, single-chuck automotive gage shown elsewhere on the Amazon site for two bucks less! Best to always check out model numbers with another source before ordering based on a picture."
19793,1,"I became aware of this product through Amazon's targeted advertising. My first thought was, ""oh one of those things that they say you need to break your windows if your car ever gets trapped underwater."" I don't ever anticipate this happening, but if it were to happen, I will be ready.I see this product having more use in the event of a vehicle rollover, where you needed to get out of the car quickly and are trapped. The unit separates from the key chain with a pull. One slice of the seat belt and a punch to the window and you're out of the car. Worth $10 for sure. Plus, I think it makes for a better key chain anchor than the stupid things most people have on their key chains."
172471,1,"I bought this hoping that it would add a few horses to my tbi 350 chevy. Well, not only did it add a few extra horses it raised my mpg by about 1.5!! This is a great product to use if your looking for a little more grunt out of your motor. It bolted on great, and you will most likely need the trans-dapt fuel line extensions, for they really came in handy. I only needed to install the left side extension, for i also purchased the actron fuel pressure tester and used the fitting as the extension for the right side line. All in all, this spacer worked out great and performed excellent for my application; stock chevy 350 tbi"
21629,1,"I have used these gloves for the past two years and I have had no problems with them. Being perforated, they breath very well in hot weather. They are not meant for cold weather though. I have worn them a couple times in the 40's and my fingers nearly froze off, but for hot weather, they can't be beat. My hands do not get hot and sweaty while wearing these. They are very comfortable, and have a knuckle guard built in. I need to order another pair only because my dog chewed the pinkie off one of them. I'm 6'2 180 and wear an XL."
133161,2,This glue is ok but dries up in 2 oz. bottle after one use. Tried to use it after two weeks and it dried up. So unless you have a lot of extra cash do not purchase until they change the packaging so you can use it more than one time.
88630,1,I purchased this unit to replace a very tired K&N intake that was installed by the previous owner on my 2003 Jeep Wrangler (4.0 Sport). This unit fit very well and trumped the K&N intake in overall build quality.
79784,0,Wiper was fine quality but did not fit a 2005 Prius rear window as advertised. Prius rear wiper has a unique mount.
122928,0,"I got this intake to replace an Outlaw CAI I had installed previously. I had high expectations since it is from K&N, but was let down. The one I bought is for a 3.4L Tacoma. I had to buy a hole saw kit like the directions said I might since mine has the resonator box, but the directions show it in the wrong location. Also, the way things are lined up, my truck's hoses had to be routed differently and are stretched pretty tight just to get them to fit. The intake sounds great and looks decent, but for the money and brand I expected more. The hole saw part is just ridiculous!"
127435,2,"For someone who just wants a quick pressure readout, without having to mess around to make sure the gauge is inserted correctly, this tool is not that easy to use. It's much easier to get an air pump nozzle over the tire nipple then to get this over the same nipple. At times I've had the gauge show me 29, then a few seconds later when I tried again, it showed 31. I assume I wasn't using it correctly. There must be easier gauges out there for people like me."
188540,1,"Best thing (of way to many things) that I ever bought for my bike (Harley Davidson Dyna). Team these with the heel rests and you are BETTER than floor boards. Greatly increases comfort and endurance on long rides. I have a bad back, and these have been a life saver (and ride saver) for me. Lets you move your foot around if you want. Multiple riding positions. AWSOME is not description enough."
87083,1,"With multiple attachment options and a very conveniently long cable, this charger does everything I need and more. Better fit and finish than most of the competitors I have seen and/or used."
23505,2,"Do not but, it totally misses the fit in my Odyssey.Web site stated it was for this carbut it is not true,I will have to go get other brand."
140595,0,"good for reading and clearing codes, thats all. use to find out what code is and with manual able to fix a few minor problems like o2 sensor and save some money on auto repair. auto parts stores will also scan your car for free."
137917,1,"These are the best brake pads on the market for BMW Motorcycles, as well as others."
132788,1,"The AC-Delco line of filters is a bit more expensive than aftermarket brands, but I've found that it performs well on my 1990 Blazer. I've used nothing but AC-Delco filters on the vehicle since it was new. Now there are 313,000 miles on the engine and it doesn't smoke, doesn't use oil, idles well, and gets decent gas mileage."
113252,1,"My husband bought this item for my truck to help my gas mileage, (I had my doubts) but I said ok. WOW what a surprise, not only did my gas mileage get better (about 2 mpg) but what a power increase. I hit my passing gear and my truck flys I was amazed. Install was pretty straight forward. Now I keep asking my husband what else we can do. K and N Cold Air Intake System 02-03 Dodge Ram 1500"
154180,1,"Works well, but requires that you rub it in with a rag or towel. It's not a thin watery spray like you'll find in dealership shops, but rather a little bit thicker, and you're supposed to rub it in, then wipe the excess off.In dry weather and on clean-ish roads, it'll last quite a while. A week or two is pretty good in my book.All in all it's a good product, but not quite as easy to use as the pro-grade stuff the shops buy in bulk. (though that stuff can be good or crappy, depends on the shop. My local Audi dealership has decent stuff, and it's less thick, more of a spray.)"
124248,2,i put this sensor in it ran good for a day then started acting checked it with computer it said it was the second sensor. i bought it it ran good for a day. checked with computer and replaced map sensor. ran good for a day went to parts store. they checked it with their computer and said front 02 sensor was bad i replaced it.the car runs fine. i guess it goes to show that when u buy the cheaper npart it isn't always cheaper. if i bought the more expensive sensor it wouldn't have cost me 300.00 in new sensors. i know better to buy the better brand bosch.
25553,2,"This product was very flimsy and by the original picture I saw before I ordered it, it looked alot different. I returned it and never got a credit! So that was a waste of 4$$. Oh well!"
95919,1,"but easy to install, quality product looks great, fit perfect, i was reluctant to spend so much on flaps only wish i would of done it when I first bought the truck"
92596,1,It's been a week since the mechanic installed this belt with the new Dorman Tensioner.. The belt is so tough and working so great.. Even if i turned the A/C while driving..
122413,0,"I love that it's Michigan, and they are unique. Plus I don't want Backyardigans or some other cartoon on my car. I have used these on 2 different vehicles, a 2000 chevy impala and a 2008 chrysler sebring and on both I have had a difficult time getting them to stay on. The hooks for hanging on the windows are useless for that, it doesn't even get the window up over the weatherstripping so not only is there wind noise, if it is raining water can get in. The suction cups stick fine once you get them on, but if you ever have to take them off to move it forget it. I had it up on my impala finally and didn't ever move them, and they stayed up during an accident (the other car hit the side the shade was on) but once I took them off to move to the new car, they have not stayed up since. Also, the ""button"" to roll up the shade is useless, my 3 year old who can figure out anything mechanical can't get it. Heck, I can hardly get it! You kind of have to push the button and roll the shade up manually. Finally, the suction cup/velcro for the bottom part is also useless. I just had to leave mine hanging down and not attached to the window."
25089,1,"I am happy with this product, it does what is is advertised. I recommend it."
128004,2,"I bought this product elsewhere, but I must say it's probably the worst car product I've ever purchased.I used it ONCE. The next time I tried, it was broken or the battery was too low -- and that's within 6 weeks! Buy this product and you've thrown your money away. Period."
18418,1,"The key chain is a bit small for my taste, but it's good looking (see my photo on product page). I guess for a $30 key chain I was expecting more heft, but it will definitely do the job. It is very lightweight and the durability has me concerned - hopefully its' build quality will put my worries to rest. The key chain has a pretty cool 3d/holographic quality to it (you can check my 9 second video clip here: youtube.com/watch?v=jC8_g4LwX10)I personally feel that it's overpriced, but you're paying for the name and the style. It looks great and hopefully it lasts!"
171630,0,"I don't know if I didn't research enough, but, living in Washington state, I was hoping for more rain protection. The cover fits well and provides adequate protection from the other elements, but does not stand up well to a fall downpour."
105711,1,These work great on my '04 Mazda 3i. They are the stock plugs for the '04 2.0 liter. There was a noticeable increase in power after I replaced them.
47664,0,"This is KC's replacement for their 385K candlepower sealed beam. This bulb, combined with their 4213, long range reflector, is a fair replacement for the sealed beam they no longer make. I'm not unhappy with it but it's surely not a true replacement for the older bulb."
64082,2,This will be the first time i will ever have to write a bad review i hope. First off ok yea like the other reviews said it came bubble wrapped ..ok i dont mind that. This thing looked way different then what the picture showed. Second this thing did not fit on my 2002 toyota tacoma i had to ghetto rig it to fit. i will never purchase from here again. i hope this helps other ppl with their next purchase.
124614,1,"What a difference in ride quality, 50K miles on the OEM shocks and the ride was a little bouncy, bolt in these babys and it is like a totally different truck, rides smooth but tightens up offroad and much more controllable, keep your Monroe's or Gabriel's KYB is the way to go. Well worth the investment"
142493,1,"Their saying is true! this stuff is the best! I use it on my synthetic leather seats, leather steering wheel, shifter, dash, decals, and whatever else needs it. This stuff is way better than any similar product i've used. It has the perfect ""glossyness""."
184755,2,"This nice little distributor cap (made in Italy)for the 1985 BMW 318i was initially offered at $2.51 and I ordered one. To Amazon's credit, they honored the price, but then, immediately afterward, the price jumped to $13.44; a 535% increase. Talk about inflation!It's still not a bad buy. Incidentally id does come complete with the RF shield. I just wish I had ordered 5 at the original price."
164410,2,This cushion failed to me any of expectations in a cushion. It was totaly uncomfortable and did nothing as promised.
117647,0,"I ordered the shifter knob and the first attempt for delivery UPS either delivered to the wrong address or left it in front of my apartment building and someone took it but Amazon made it right by sending another one immediately and using FedEx which does not leave packages on door steps not caring if the package actually makes it to its buyer. The picture on the website does not represent the actual product because in the picture the black knob has a white Hurst emblem on it and the actual knob does not. Other than that, all is well."
163418,1,"I like that the holder can be removed when not in use, unlike the velcro strips that remain permanently affixed to your windshield. However, the suction cups could be bigger and/or more of them to have a better hold, as 1-2 of the suction cups would come separated from the windshield. Using a drop of water on the suction cups before application improves its sticking strength."

39829,0,"I have used k&n got years. I have seen no improvements in power or gas mileage. I think this is a stretch to expect an airfilter to do that. Have not seen this on my cars, trucks either. I bought so I can wash. In long haul that is where you save money. I clean airfilters, oil change every 6000 miles. The fit was not there. I had to do a lot of shaving. To get it to fit...k&n I am disappointed in you guys not making sure it is a fit...it is the one you called for."
91174,1,"I was not expecting much of a difference with this bulb from my original headlight bulb but when I put it in and rode during the night I noticed a huge difference. Splitting lanes in Los Angeles rush hour traffic at night is not recommended for anyone, but now I have noticed that more people are moving out of the way for me which tells me it is much more noticeable in their rear view mirrors. I will buy another one of these headlights and would recommend it for others. Ride safe - be safe!"

154135,0,"I used this product after using the Mothers clay bar system and applying Mothers carnauba wax. The top coat went on and came over very easy, similar to the Mothers carnauba wax. I can't complain about the ease of use, but I did not notice a great difference in shine or texture of the paint. I have a 2007 Mazda 3 and the paint (phantom blue mica) is still in great shape. I also tested this product on a 2004 Nissan Sentra SE-R (Black paint) and still didn't see much of a difference on top of the Mothers carnauba & clay bar combo. Perhaps if you're using a lower grade wax, this would make a more noticeable difference. I found that when used in conjunction with a high quality wax like Mothers carnauba, the results were not worth the effort."

2215,1,"I have heard about these filter forever. I guess everyone is familiar with their claims, better gas mileage, more power, reusable, thinner thighs. All I can say is it fits, it looks good and the motorcycle for which it was bought isn't complaining about it.If I notice anything else over the next few months, I'll edit this report. That said, I don't push the bike to its limits and don't pay much attention to gas mileage. I have several friends who swear to it and, frankly, they are the picky kind of people who pay attention to that kind of thing."

The product took about 2 minutes to install and while I can't substantiate the HP or fuel mileage increase, I can tell you the acceleration right off the bottom is noticeable immediately. If you switch your filter, this ""lifetime"" replacement is a ""must have""!"
165631,2,"I bought one of these to charge the batteries of 2 vehicles that had been sitting for 7 months while I was away. I figured that with the ability to crank an engine for 5 seconds, I could probably get a vehicle started or at least charge the battery. The first attempt was on my car with a completely dead battery--no voltage at all. The charger wouldn't even recognize that it was connected to the battery--probably a result of a safety ""feature"" which may need to sense voltage to know it is connected to a battery. Since it didn't sense it was connected to a battery, it would not apply a charge or provide any cranking power.Next I tried it on the battery of my truck which had a little voltage left, but not enough to start the engine. The 5 second starting power of the charger would not turn the engine over. It did, however, charge the battery overnight and the truck started right up the next morning. I then used the truck to jumpstart the car with the completely dead battery and allowed the car to run for about a half hour. This gave the battery enough voltage so that the charger could then recognize it was connected and supply a charge to the battery. After about 6 hours, the car battery was fully charged and a test indicated that the battery was not faulty.After all this, I returned the charger to Amazon and bought a Sears premium one that had better specs for about the same price and was told it WOULD start a completely dead battery. Had some similiar looking control panel items to the Schumacher charger so may be same manufacturer. Haven't had a chance to try on completely dead battery.If you buy the Schumacher SC-8000A, don't expect to charge a completely dead battery or crank anything other than a very small engine.Shipment packing from Amazon was poor--it allowed the heavy charger to bang around in the box. When I turned the charger upside down, parts inside moved around--not a good sign."

I changed the air filter which was filthy and still I had poor mileage. I tried filling up with the gasoline add on at the pump, nothing. Then I bought Sea Foam, dumped it in the tank just before filling up (near empty), topped it off, and saw immediate results. The first highway gallon got me 37 miles and the next gallon (mix of highway and city) got my 30 more miles. I am VERY pleased with this product. My car is back to factory mileage!"

170678,1,BAL Light Trailer Tire LevelerMy husband and I purchased this to use with our 2010 Rockwood 1904 Pop UP. It came highly recommended by the folks at Popupexplorer.com.We found it to be an excellent device for leveling our camper. It also helps to stabilize the popup by providing a secure brace for the wheel.The price was very reasonable and I highly recommend this device to all Light trailer users.

24635,1,"I absolutely adore this windscreen. I have a Suzuki S83 and had a manufacturer windshield. However I've been customizing the bike and the large bulky windshield wasn't exactly part of my vision for a bobbed cruiser. After a lot of Web surfing and reading customer reviews, I found this windscreen. Some of the other reviews (outside of Amazon) were mixed. Some said they loved it and others said they couldn't discern it's impact. Well I bought it and installed it on my bike. It does exactly what it said it would do - which is keep air from hitting me in the chest at high speeds, thus avoiding the feeling of holding on for dear life above 60 MPH. As you may expect wind will still hit your shoulders and head but you don't have to do 'pull ups' to stay on the bike. Besides I wouldn't want to eliminate wind on the head or shoulders (if I wanted that I'd have kept the big bulky windshield - or I'd just stay in my car). To maximize wind protection simply adjust the height of the screen. And on top of it's performance, it just makes the bike look even more amazing. The perfect complement to the Mustang seat, Kuryakyn handlebars and foot pegs, and a few other items. And now a windscreen that adds to, and does not detracts from, the cool profile.The only difficulty I had was with the installation. It was indeed simple but it took longer than expected and the gasket table is a bit confusing. You have to measure your fork's diameters in millimeters but the manufacturer then provides the gasket thickness measurement in inches. Plus I think the conversion table is a bit off. However other than that, it's a wonderful addition to my bike that greatly adds to the bike's ""cool factor!"""

123622,0,"We are a family of 7 & were planning a vacation from southern Illinois to Florida for our 5 small children to see the ocean for the first time. We researched many cartop carriers and after reading all the reviews chose the Highland Kar Pak. I paid the extra shipping fee to have it delivered in time before we left. It arrived and my better half was thrilled with what it turned out to be. Easy loading, still room to spare, tied down nicely, the complete package was impressive to him. He had intended on tying it down with rope for extra assurance. We decided it was safe without it & we shouldn't have to and set out on our 16 hour drive. Around 9 o'clock at night, 5 hours in, and somewhere in TN we were startled by loud knocking on the window. After pulling over on the side of the busy interstate we discovered that the front right strap had snapped away from the bag itself. Luckily we had some small bungee cords on our cooler in the van. We secured it till we were satisfied & drove on. All was well until the following day when we were 2 exits away from our destination & heard a similiar disturbing noise. We pulled off once again and the same thing had happened with the strap on the other side. We didn't have many choices then so we drove slowly to the next town & purchased ratchet straps for $40 so we would be able to secure the bag on the trip home. We were so very much pleased with this purchase in every way and then so very disappointed when both front straps broke away from the bag. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. And I would also definitely take extra precautions when securing it to the vehicle."

14429,1,"I purchased this Metra 44-UA200 antenna for my 2007 Chevrolet Silverado Classic. It restored operation of my FM 1 and 2 analog radio bands after using the factory mast antenna to connect my added Peripheral HD tuner by iSimple for OEM radios, which had caused me to lose RDS and time setting features provided on the OEM radio analog band setting (the added HD band functions don't provide RDS and the time feature provided on the factory radio's OEM FM1 analog band).This Metra antenna has a roughly 1""x3"" box at its center. The ends extending from this ""box"" are a 1/16"" thin electronics board looking material which appears to only be only somewhat flexible. Overall length of the antenna section is roughly 14"".The antenna ""box"" has a small red LED lighted when powered. It also has a short woven grounding strap, and a long length of antenna cable with an attached positive power lead bonded to it. The radio plug is standard Motorola. There are also three ample areas on the antenna section with adhesive for mounting.I used aMetra 40-GM21 Gm Radio Antenna Adapter with Barbless Connnectoradapter with this Metra antenna to adapt its standard Motorola connector to the OEM radio in my 2007 Silverado Classic - which uses the male ""mini"" antenna connector provided on the Metra 40-GM21 adapter.I wrapped the entire antenna in about a 1/4"" of poly foam and used some duct tape to hold this in place. After removing the factory radio, I found a place just rearward of the center dash windshield vent and used a nylon cabe tie to anchor the antenna in place - totally hidden under the 2007 Silverado dash. I also drilled a small hole in a grounded bracket there and used a small eye ""crimp"" connector and screw to secure the ground.The Metra 40-GM21 adapter had a 90 degree bend I also removed, as a bend in the coax was not needed in my install - as such a bend, or a pinched cable, can severely degrade electrical performance of any antenna system. This was done by simply spreading the metal crimp, bending the tang straight, and crimping it back lightly to avoid any pinching of the coax cable on the adapter.***NOTE***Both theMetra 40-GM21 Gm Radio Antenna Adapter with Barbless Connnectorand theDeluxe Windshield Glass Mount Amplified Antenna Separate Ground Wireuse a small diameter coax that doesn't have a lot of shielding or insulation. This can be a problem as it lends the cable more readily prone to interference and signal degradation from sharp bends or a pinched cable. Be sure to also run the cables away from electrical wiring. Parallel wiring of the coax with twist ties or tape to electrical wiring can induce interference into the antenna coax.Once I had the antenna and radio installed, I checked the performance. The antenna provided good signal for local FM without connecting the power wire for its amplifier. This was enough to restore my RDS and ""auto"" time setting features. The analog band AM was very weak by comparison. But, once the power wire was connected, AM returned to the analog radio band at roughly what it had been using the OEM fender mounted mast antenna - and my FM improved to the point of adding the more distant FM stations that had been previously provided by the mast antenna. The small internal amplifier of this antenna just helps overcome losses from its long and very thin coax - a good reason for connecting the short included grounding strap. A shorter and better shielded coax with a larger center wire would probably make the power wire un-necessary - especially considering the added adapter connection I used probably created a 3dB signal loss. Overall, I'm pleased with this antenna and would recommend it, as it did exactly what I wanted and needed - and for the fact I was able to totally conceal it and still have very good performance using it.made in china"

146186,1,"I purchased these brake rotors to do a brake job on a 2005 Ford Escape XLT and they work very well. At the time of this review, we have had these rotors on the car for six months and when paired with Centric Posi-Quiet ceramic brake pads they are quiet, do not dust and have not had any issues warping. It also seems like the e-coating has helped with preventing corrosion to the degree that you would normally see on the rotors. I would not hesitate to recommend these or buy them again."
73607,2,"The parking mats are EXTREMELY light. There is a small sticky strip on the bottom of the mat in one single location. The first time my wife pulled into our garage, the mat moved about 6 inches forward. The sticky strip does not hold this mat in place, and the mat is too light to stay in place on its own, which basically means these mats are completely worthless. On the packaging material that came with the mats, it says ""the mats may move"". They are right, they do move... don't waste your money."
139694,1,I purchased this bag for a cross country motorcycle trip. I was gone for eleven days and the bag worked great. I am very happy I purchased it. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a rain cover. I used a cover from a smaller bag which only covered the top and fortunately I didn't have any problem with my stuff getting wet. The bag is well worth the money.

69222,2,"I ordered this product mainly because of the high rate of positive reviews. I own several Battery Tenders for my motorcycles but needed a charger that can charge at a higher rate than 1.25 amp. I had hopes this is the one!Upon receiving the charger I found that is looks nice but on closer examination the casing is poorly made, uneven, with a flimsy extending handle on top, and with a hard to use storage compartment (once you open the cables). It also lacks an on/off switch but this is not unique to this product.The fan works all the time (it does not kick in only when the temperature climbs) and it is VERY noisy and not very reassuring. I have to wonder how long it will last. When you unplug the charger the digital display is a spectacle of blinking/flickering lights (probably the capacitors)... also not very reassuring.However the most surprising thing was that according to the charger display, and after testing with different types and sizes of batteries, it routinely charges the batteries at 15.8 - 16.1volts. This was confirmed by measuring independently with a voltmeter. This is very high. All current and prior chargers I had were around 14V. Maybe this one uses a different algorithm that may explain this, but it does make me worry a bit.As for quality, other than the quite flimsy look and feel, the first unit I received refused to switch automatically to a the maintenance mode. I easily got a replacement from Amazon (Thanks!) which does switch to the maintenance mode. However, even this unit takes its time to enter the maintenance mode and despite reporting 100% capacity it may take the unit a long time to switch to maintenance.The charger is supposed to be automatic, but it does not detect the type of battery it is connected to so that you have to set it yourself to the type of battery as well as to the size of the battery and make your decisions as to the rate of charge. From an &#34;automatic&#34; charger I would have expected more."
127365,1,Wheelskins are the best leather steering wheel wraps. I have tried others but have been disapointed. I have a wheelskin wrap on the steering wheel of each of my vehicles. They may be a little more expensive than some of the other wraps but they are definatly worth it. They are made of quality leather and fit smoothly and tigtly to the steering wheel.They are easy to install and last years without loosing their shape. They feel luxurious on the steering wheel and add to the pleasure of driving.

I got 4 of these because i know that with the higher wattage they won't last as long as the stock 55w bulbs but what i did not expect was going through all 4 bulbs in less than 2 weeks. I won't be buying these again its just not worth the $16 a week price tag.
168765,2,I tried this in my 98 Ninja ZX-6 and unfortunately the bulb generates far less light than the regular incandescent bulbs that came with the bike. So much dimmer in fact I felt it would be unsafe to use these bulbs. I sent them back for a refund.

These were a replacement for my stock pads on a German car which made a lot of dust. The stock pads were so bad that if I didn't clean the wheels at least once a week they'd be filthy. These produce almost no dust compared to stock, so little in fact that I've only cleaned the wheels once since installing them and it was barely even dirty at that point. If you're sick of constantly having to clean your wheels just to keep the brake dust off, I recommend you get these pads, I'm very happy I did. BTW, they came with the wear sensors too, so that was an added bonus since I didn't need to buy those separately."
155259,0,"This thing is okay. The ""switch"" to go between hose and tank is fairly pointless and in fact, it has such a small hole that it reduces the flow somewhat from the Flush King. It is a straight connector unlike the Flush King that comes out at 45 degrees. Lucky for me I already had a 45 degree flush, but it doesn't have a valve so that's why I bought this. It works, but the fit wasn't great. The more I had to twist the hose/tank switch and push/pull the valve, the more that the thing tried to come off my trailer. It would start sliding off and leaking on the ground a little. As long as I kept a good eye on it I could keep it from doing that. The Flush King is more expensive but I think if I had my choice to do it all over I would buy the original and I would buy it online from Tweetys not camping world.

147968,2,"My husband was able to plug my tire with a little bit of effort, struggle, and trial and error. All seemed to work well. However, after plugging it, we left for vacation for a week, and when we returned having not driven it at all, the tire had only 10psi when it was originally left with 40psi. Realizing that the plug did not create an air-tight seal, we took it to a tire repair place that patches tires for free. After waiting in line for 20 minutes, they told me that they cannot patch a tire that has already been plugged since the plug adheres to the tire wall, and they would have to drill a hole bigger than the plug in order to remove it. We took it to another tire center just to confirm, and they told us the same thing that it cannot be patched after being plugged. How does it ""enable you to get to a service center safely"" if the service center won't be able to remove the plug afterwards? Essentially, I paid for the plug kit to prevent me from being able to properly patch my tire and now have to spend at least $200 to buy a new tire. Fantastic."

Now, a few months later it's a flat, lifeless little thing that falls on the ground every time I get out of the vehicle. Not worth the money. If you need back support while driving, just use one of the little pillows in the guest room. You know, the one on the rocking chair that says ""Worlds Greatest Fisherman"" or something, and save your money."
102368,1,"Used the RV9YC to replace the plugs in a Mercruiser 470. Perfect fit. They are a little expensive, but if you live as far from the parts store as I do, it's worth it. They shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. I ordered an extra so I can easily test for spark if the motor dies."
127599,1,"This gauge has worked great for me. I've had it about a year and keep it on my motorcycle in my tank bag so while not exposed directly to rain, it is subject to temparture extremes, humidity, etc. I don't have any issues with this gauge that you wouldn't have with any other, e.g., the head of the gauge has to be squarely seated against the valve to prevent air escaping. This gauge was also rated as a top pick for accuracy and durability in a Motorcycle Consumer News issue from a couple of years back. (Think ""Consumer Reports"" for the motorcyclist community.)My tank bag was recently stolen, along with this air gauge inside it. I will be replacing it with an identical item. It's simple, durable, and accurate. What else can I say? The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because I think it should come with some type of cheap case to protect it, since it is an electronic measuring device."
38445,1,"Used this product to repair a small star mark in a car windshield. Follow the directions carefully and you won't be disappointed! In less than an hour from start to finish, all that was left was a very minute mark at the center of impact. Unless you knew exactly where the rock hit, you would not be able to tell where it did hit. I would recommend it to anyone!"
85709,0,"They fit the seat okay, the order also came with some arm rest covers but my Titan does not have armrests? There is no cover for the center box as shown in the picture but it is not listed in the description either so whatever custom..."
78043,2,"My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work. Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those ""just in case"" moments. We plugged it in and have left it in since then. Just this week our battery was dead again. We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work. We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start. Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?We haven't tried the outlet power, so I have no idea how reliable that is.I won't count on this machine. Luckily I have a small battery charger that I can plug my car into, and after twenty minutes or so I'm ready to go. I won't be getting rid of that charger--it's much more dependable."
81440,2,I ordered this for a 2002 Toyota Sienna. This product does not fit the 2001 to 2003 Toyota Sienna.
6349,2,"The helmet is really nice looking. The only problem is that no matter who we had try it on, it sits so high when worn that it looks totally goofy, so we are just going to put it on display and forget about wearing it. That is disappointing."
185791,1,"I've been trying to match up my driving lights with the super-white headlights on my CLK500 because the factory ones have that ""yellowish"" look. I've very pleased with these 70W bulbs. They have a blueish tint (similar to HID) and look much nicer with the headlights. I was also a bit fearful of using 70W when the manual calls for 55W after reading some horror stories about harnesses burning up on some cars when 100W were used. I've had these in for a few weeks and I'm very pleased."
147436,0,"Well im stuck with this item. It is consider hazardous and you can't return it. All it is, is wire though. Not sure why its considered hazardous. My winch is placed at the front of vehicle and I don't put it on take it off etc."
68140,1,I bought these for a 95 Honda Accord with some powerslot rotors and they work great. Car stops well and no more squeeky brakes.
122364,0,I purchased two of these bicycle type wheels for a garden cart I was building. I had a 3/4 inch cold roll steel bar for an axle and these wheels fit fine. These aren't some cheap thin wall tires on the rim. Both tire and rim are heavy duty. Very pleased with this purchase. If you are building your own garden cart this wheels are top choice.
75130,1,Fit correctly and US made. Installed on rear of a 1978 FJ40 along with four new wheel cylinders and shoes.No problems
35435,1,It was perfect for the bike that I just bought.The new Vespa. S I'm very happy with this product.
120543,1,"Good product, I was able to install it without trouble. I've been happy with the Air Lift, 10 psi is all I need in the springs to level out the truck when towing my camp trailer. The compressor would be nice if you need to adjust psi often. A bicycle tire pump is all I need to adjust psi for my needs on weekends."
3808,1,I was very please to find the seat cover it has been discontinued in the store and the last one I found was in Hawaii. It arrive on time and looks great in my car.
100835,1,So glad that I found this product. I like my copper and silver looking like it is brand new and this does the trick. Thanks....
93844,0,"These look pretty sturdy for the price for sure. I have a Ford F150 pickup and these are way too big to go in the stake holes. I'm talking like 3/8"" too big. If they wont fit an F150 what will they fit? I have a band saw so I cut a lot of rubber off and made them fit. I expect the steel screw part will rust immediately.. so once they are in it may be hard to ge them loose. Still for the price....they're ok if you have a bandsaw... The plate appears to be stainless steel, theloop chrome and the threaded ""bolt"" zinc coated steel. Probably a bad combo for the long term. would be nice if the bolt was SS also."
16565,1,fits just right on toyota 4runners with factory installed roof racks. easy to install/remove. can be opened on either side. pretty sleek design. no wind noise even at high speeds.
184523,2,"I bought this product along with the basemat to try to soften the engine noise in my 91 civic, but it does not seem to deaden the sound that comes through to the cabin. I installed under the hood and installed the basemat on the fire wall and floorboards according to the instructions. The hood closes with a nice solid THUD now, which is nice, but the engine noise level is not dampened. I will not buy this product again nor recommend it."
122740,0,"Picked up these pads for my 98 and I thought I was going to get amazing brake pads for this price but man they are not worth it.What I do like is they stop amazing and seem to wear well but the noise is extremely annoying. At almost any stop the pads squeal, I have found that this is a common problem with hawk pads in general and wish i would have found out sooner. I replaced them with wagner and couldnt be happier. Biggest waste of $70.."
155137,1,"Good horn for the money, even included the relay. It could be a little louder, like the Stebel, but it's much louder than what I had."
35904,0,"The bottle opener works fine, but I found that the cylinder valve I had was larger than the clamp would accept. So, I had to put it on a lathe and open it up a little so that it would fit. If you don't have access to that kind of tooling I would be wary of spending 300$ on this thing."
141441,1,This Turn Signal Socket is just like the original Socket. I also like the shrink wrap connectors for the three wires. The socket has performed flawlessly since I installed it.
82725,2,"These mirrors seemed to have good reviews, but upon use, found that they were too large for my mirror, and gave the absolute wrong angles. I went with another smaller mirror that was adjustable."
15133,2,dosnt work all the time when it does it is helful. but overall not the best product
33797,0,This unit was great the first time I used it but now the seat warmer only gets a mild warm feeling.
671,0,"everything is about the jacket is awsome except for the fact im 6'2"" and it doesnt reach down my body as far as i would like."
26219,1,Easy to install and works fine on my dual axle flatbed.Easily adjusts to conditions as necessarySmall enough toeasily mount within reach
156654,1,What more can I say? Easy to install and high quality. Would definitely buy them again.
64422,2,Ordered top for 98 Jeep wrangler and received top for 95 model. I put the correct make and model into their form and thought I was getting the right one. The process selected the wrong model number which they delivered. The process should not have let me order a top for a vehicle different from the one that I selected. Amazon quickly delivered the top and made arrangements with UPS to pick it up the next day.
6290,1,"I just used this hitch rack to bring my son up to University. It worked well, however, my own dumb fault, I didn't realize that my exhaust piped right into the rack. The result was that it melted a huge plastic bin that I had on the rack as well as all the plastic things inside (coffee maker, dishes, cups, other). So, it's a great way to carry extra stuff, but be careful how your exhaust pipe points!!!!"
67799,1,This has been the best plastic cleaner I have ever used. Keep making it.
108957,2,I had these installed on my 2001 Nissan Xterra. My night-time vision is not great. I found the Silverstar Ultras a great improvement over the factory installed bulbs in terms of brightness and field of vision.However one burned out within a year and I replaced again with the Silverstar Ultra. Two weeks later the other one burned out and so I had no option but to putchase yet another Silverstar Ultra. Looking at Xterra bulletin boards I have found other owners with similar problems with the product.The bulbs give off great light but I would not be buying again. Xterra owners beware!
113636,2,The wrong bra was sent to me. I ordered a bra for a 2009 Honda Accord. Instead I was sent a bra for a Saturn automobile. This is a very careless mistake by the shippper. The bra was also of poor quality and did not meet by standards.
132599,0,Ordered 2 of these for my F150 combined with a set of Raybestos PT Plus shoes. Installed one wheel and ran out of daylight. Felt very smooth on the test drive. Installed the other side the next day and the drum was out of round. Noticed it when I put it in but thought it was just the outside edge. Test drive showed shimmy when I used the brakes. Tried to get a replacement via Amazon but got an email saying they were out of stock and their alternate vendor wanted $17 to ship it so got it elsewhere online. Not my best experience with Amazon which is normally really good as I've bought over a hundred items from them over the last few years.
6501,2,The product took 4-5 days to get here and it did not fit my 95 acura integra.The hole mounts are incorrect. Mine are 9 or 7.5 inches and the kit fan was 10 3/8 inches.Those dimensions are for the top of the radiator. Amazon said this was anexact fit and they are incorrect.
51190,1,"We have used this wax for 27 years and there is no better. If you do it exactly as it says it will protect your car forever. We had a corvette that we had numerous coats on and it was scratched up by someone on the rear wheel base and we went out with a little wax and it completely was gone in seconds. We learned about it from my bilaw that had a classic car and this was all the club used. It is sometimes hard to get, but it is all we use. We just bought a new vehicle and we are on our 4th coat. Easy to use, not like a wax. It is like they say a polish and wipes of so easy"
108641,1,"I bought this to lubricate the wheels of a stroller which were not rolling smoothly. Now the wheels spin like they have ball bearings. Amazing. I had to clean the gutters today, so I got my collapsible Werner ladder out. I noticed that the locks on the ladder were really hard to pull out. I remembered I had this stuff, applied it to the locks, and wow, they just slide right out. Another example is my old garden hose spray nozzle. I had already bought a new one because the old one had become stiff. You had to press really hard to get it going, and sort of had to pull on the trigger lever to shut it off again. I applied some of this stuff, exercised it a little, and now it works like new again.It's not going to come as a surprise that I tell you I recommend this grease. It does a great job of greasing stuff up. Seems to work on anything, but really does well when you have plastic meeting metal."
22607,1,Part arrived in a timely manor and installed with no problems. They look good. A lot cheaper than a local auto parts store.
23205,0,"This top works well when the Ranger is off the trailer going at it's speed. I twice tried to tow the Ranger on a trailer going 55 MPH down the highway. The first time one corner came loose and started flapping, I thought it was just me not installing properly. The next time it tore one of the straps loose, pulled the velcro from the roll bar and shredded the rear of the top (I didn't catch it quite as soon as the previous time). It does only take a couple of minutes to put the top on and take it off so I guess that would be the best practice, but I don't want to mess with it every time so I guess I will have to go with a hard top."
108898,0,"Installed these bulbs in my Toyota 4Runner and noticed an improvement in performance over my previous headlights. They are definitely not HID level but that is hard to expect without installing a whole new system.The longevity, however, is NOT good. Bought these bulbs nearly three years ago and one bulb has died with only moderate driving and usage of the bulbs. I've noticed other reviews mentioning even shorter life spans.UPDATE 11/23/12: After a couple more years the other bulb is still going strong so lifespan can vary. In exchange for better performance over my factory bulbs I think I'm willing to exchange a little in shorter durability."
182848,0,"Bought this for my convertable to hold both mine and my daughters sun glasses for when we drive in the sun with the top down. It is a 1994 car and the visors are old, but still function. The clip is horrible and keeps falling off my visor when we are still in the driveway. Purchased a new one that was clipped with the wire, but only single. Holds a lot tighter then the plastic clip. Don't recommend if you have thin visors."
128551,2,"The item is not compatible with the existing StreetGlow car kit i have.Even tho it is the SAME model and same brand yet the connector for this tube was a female type (should've been male) and it has an extra pin!So I took the car to the StreetGlow dealer whom i bought the original product from and even their technician was confused!Anyway, what we did is we cut the female plug off, stripped all the wires, then we cut off the male plug from the damaged LED since it plugs correctly with the existing tubes, stripped it off and we matched all the cable colors together, but we ended up with the extra 7th cable in this replacement tube, which was a brown color wire.The system worked but with only red light and no effects! So we started to touch the brown wire with the other 6 exposed connections till we were able to get (blue, green, white) to work with all of the functions. The problem is the replacement tube is not responding to the functions, it stays constant on.So this makes me wonder how come a replacement tube is NOT compatible at all with its own kit?!"
152787,1,The was the first time I purchased an auto part online. The Belt works fine and the price was good. I'll definitely be doing this again.
155055,0,"I only buy meguiars producs and when I was using this product to remove tar it did not do a good job, did not remove and tar. never tried to remove bugs with it befor."
183663,0,"I applied this product on a cool morning (65 deg.) to a completely clean and dry finish. I have an older car ('94 Volvo) whose paint is in good condition, without much oxidation.This wax was very easy to apply (I used a foam applicator). Even though I was careful not to apply it heavily, I found this wax never became dry to the touch; rather, it stayed somewhat tacky...even as the morning progressed and temperatures increased as I moved on to other sections of the car.As a result, removing the wax by buffing was difficult. First I tried clean birdseye (diapers); then I had to switch to more heavily textured terry cloth to get anything happening. Finally I got the material off, but suspect in some places it's still not completely off. I may have to go back with an electric buffer to really work the stuff off.All in all, of all the car waxes I've ever used, this is the hardest to remove. The resulting finish is very shiny, though, and I will assume durable based on all the testing done by Consumer Reports."
149397,1,"Very well constructed product. Will fit the AMC 304 currently in my CJ-7 as well as the AMC 401 that I am building to replace the 304 when it tires out. I like the under carriage exit leaving the vehicle to appear more stock. The the stubs that bolt to the lower plates of the manifolds are included in the set and will allow the manufacture and attachment of a custom exhaust system. These manifolds are sold as &#34; uncoated &#34; however, they are painted with a standard quality paint to prevent rust during shipping and storage. High temp would burn this coating off rapidly, so requires stripping prior to recoating with high temp paint or coating. The price is unbeatable, particularly when Free Shipping is taken into consideration...."
109325,2,Unfortunately the unit received was defective. It leaked from inside the dial to the point I could not get a pressure reading. It was returned for a credit.
119756,1,"From the photo and description,it said full chassis skid plate. Lead me to think that the swing arm and a arms were also included but at $111 I should of known better. maybe they should say engine skid plate. but hey you live and learn."
82623,1,Purchased this belt as a replacement for the OEM Acura belt on my RSX. The new belt from Amazon was &#60;50% of the cost from the dealer and when I took the old belt off I wasn't surprised to see the exact same Bando part number on it as the new one purchased from Amazon. I doubt that the belts sold by Honda/Acura have any sort of stricter quality control where they only accept certain batches from Bando so I feel confident that this is an exact OEM replacement (just without the dealer markup).
127800,1,Accutire gauge is a nice product. It accurately takes tire pressure within a 1/2 a pound. Digital read out lights up in the dark.My car runs a straight path rather than pulling from one side to the other.I would like to see a probe added to let excess air out of the tire when filling the tire with air. This probe would aid in the tire pressure accuracy.I've had this product for four months and would recommend it to any one with accuracy concerns.
143422,0,I purchased this support bar to remove the engine from a Ford Escape. It worked as advertised. I did put some rubber hose on the feet to lessen the likelihood of damage to the inner fender.
3999,2,"This is a very nice-looking light. However, it was not the same length as the OEM light on my truck, coming up 1/8&#34; short on the length of the lens. And the body of the light assembly would not fit into the light opening on the vehicle. RECON said they never had a problem with this applications before. But I had no choice but to return the unit and purchase another (different) brand LED light."
18068,1,This is a perfect match for the original one I had which was stripped. I purchased this with a HeliCoil kit and it worked great!
177236,1,"I already had heard that K&N made great products. But I never bought any of them till I foundmine at a very resonable price on Amazon, much cheaper than the auto parts stores and I checked them ALL. I dropped it into my Yamaha R6 and all I can say is that I have a brand new bike. Much faster off the line as well as top end power and going thru less gas while at it too. If you can find one that will fit your ride find it here add to cart then check out period. Easy install came with instructions and some K&N stickers to throw on my bike as well. Thanks Amazon for a great buy."
74204,2,"I think it lasted maybe a week and then it fell apart. Good idea, look for something else dont waste your money on this one."
80780,1,"This K&N; air filter is a good value, and fits the 1st generation Suzuki SV650 ('99 - '02). I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not come pre-oiled, so you'll have to buy a separate bottle of oil (I recommend the K&N; 99-5050 Filter Care Service Kit - Squeeze, available on Amazon).Otherwise a good fit and does the job. Recommended."
66112,0,"I had purchased at set of louvers for my 1987 IROC shortly after buying the car new. The louvers were basically two plastic sides with aluminum slats in between, supported by a pair of plastic ribs underneath with adjustable legs (with rubber feet). There were two hinges with hooks on the top edge to allow it to be lifted for cleaning, and clips on either side that attached it to the hatch back . . . and it looked EXACTLY like the photo for this product (right down to the height of the bottom above the window, the subtle center supports, and the seams between the side panels and the individual slats). A couple of years ago the louvers got damaged, and thinking I would be able to replace them easily enough . . . I discarded them.I recently decided to restore the car and started looking for replacements for the old louvers. The old assembly tended to rattle a bit, (though that was easily corrected by a few minor adjustments of the legs and adding a little black RTC to the joints between the aluminum and plastic sides) so when I saw this product, listed on another site as being constructed of ""ABS Plastic, Black, paintable"" I assumed this was an ""update"", that corrected that little problem, and ordered it.What I received was a one large flimsy washboard like sheet of black plastic with slots cut out in such a manner that it reduced visibility through it by at least 50%. There was a large flange running horizontally along the bottom edge which basically covered a 3 inch strip across the bottom of the window (which you will note, is just NOT there in the picture), and the horizontal ""slats"" were connected to each other by pairs of protruding black plastic lumps . . . not the less visable and more substantial ribs of my orignals. These louvers did have a lower profile than my originals, and I could see that they were less likely to rattle, but they did not have the same look, they were not as firm, and despite the insistance of the manufacturer who I contacted after receiving them, they DO NOT look like the picture.Facing the fact that these things looked like something out of a giant vac-u-form, and seriously cheapened the look of the car, I decided that the vehicle looked better without them, and sent them back. Unless I can find a set like the my originals, it will likely stay that way."
172120,0,This is a nice brush. I looked at other brushes at Target that are not made as well and cost more. This one come with 3 mop heads and the head is padded so that the plastic will not scratch the car. The only problem I had was the slow shipping.
15671,2,I bought these to give a slight boost to my headlights on back roads. The filaments are poorly positioned and give a spotty beam pattern. Nor did they appear any brighter than the bulbs I replaced in my 2002 Tahoe.Stick with a well engineered lamp like the Philips Vision Plus or Sylvania ExtraVision and you will be fine.Note: To those of you that put HID lighting in halogen style headlamps in order to look cool and blind oncoming traffic...STOP THAT! Get proper projector housings and be cool for real.
179483,0,"This item is big and get only 60 watts,.. so I was looking for more. I invest $1000 for a Sanyo HIP 200,.. its the about the same size and weight but produce 200 watt.Cons, Old technology, big, come in 4 pcs, only 60 wattPro, good price, come with accessories, easy to buy."
175021,1,Love the license plate frame! Good quality and looks good on my mustang especially when the convertible top is down
34796,1,"PIAA's Super Silicone line are simply the best wiper blades I have ever used. They are effective, durable, and well worth the price of admission. They may need a short break in period, but just follow the instructions that come with the blade(s) and you will not be disappointed. Streak-free, stutter-free, squeak-free operation. And the best part? These wiper blades are good for YEARS! I only replace these about every 18 to 24 months when their performance starts to wane, and as of this review I am on my third set. They may not look like much, but they've got it where it counts."
104340,0,"I thought I was ordering something I needed, but the orbital sander-polisher I was buying at the same time, and which this was intended for, already had one installed on it."
13255,0,"1) I'm not sure if I installed in right-side up or upside down in the airbox. It seems to fit both ways, and I don't know if it matters.2) I forgot I installed it, and a few days later I noticed ""hey, my car seems to have less power"". Then I thought ""what have I done differently to my car?"", and I remembered I installed this air filter.Luckily, I saved the paper filter. I am going to put it back and see what happens. I'm also going to see if reversing the K&N; will matter.You may have a different experience, but this is what happened to me."
84069,0,I guess it is probably my fault but doesn' fit. Shipping was fast and order was complete. I should have looked at the picture better or they should have a better picture. My 74 VW Bug distributer has a round hole in the side of it. The condenser has a square one. I didn't get a chance to try to install it for a while so didn't even open the package for a month. Live and learn. I just thought since it said it fit my Bug it would.Still happy with Amazon and the deals I've gotten. Just be sure of what you order or compare when you get it so you can exchange. Rest of my order was 4 stars.
33753,1,"This is a great product but you do have to remember to shut it off when you get out of the car or you will drain your battery! We had just placed a new heavy duty battery in our truck because I had drained the battery down with my heating pad. I left it on over night. Thinking I had shut it off, I had actually put it on ""Hi"". This device does not have an automatic shutoff, so you need to make sure it is off before you get out of the car. It heats fantastic."
169424,0,"Bought this to replace a broken drivers side mirror on a 99 Ford Escort ZX2. The important thing to note is that this is NOT AN OEM PART. It fits and does the job but there's a small gap between the top of the mirror and the door. This is covered (and protected from elements) when the door is closed and the rubber stripping from the frame falls over it. However, it's a little worrisome that it's not a flush mount. Overall it's great for the price but I'd still recommend hunting down the OEM part."
60955,1,"Product was well packaged and all parts needed for install. The only thing is they packaged the wrong instructions for installation. K&N has a great website that allows the buyer to download the instructions. They thought of everything for you to install, such as longer screws, hose etc. Fit perfect."
119366,0,"Solid product but the short tube where you adust the tre's is kinda cheesy and the boots tore easy. I used this for a XJ tre upgrade and after a year of abuse its still solid. It would probably last forever on a ""street"" jeep."
98064,2,"Failed on second use, nut separated from body. Took broken shell to department store and found Toyota filter housing is same as Puralator L14477 filter if you dont have time to order one."
156309,1,"I bought the Curt trailer ball, hitch, and sway bar all at the same time. The quality and price can't be beat. Assembly of everything was easy. I bought these for a 2012 Silverado and they all fit perfect. Great deal."
150223,0,Easy fitting with the brackets from my old Memphis fats screen. Less buffetting than the latter but more wind noise.
187239,2,I was haveing trouble not sure order went thru so I order same item from eBay and not even ten minutes after ordering from ebay amazon order came thru try to cancel immiediately but they would not cancel now I have two items so if you order something from amazon make sure because you can not cancel
55697,2,I used it ONE DAY and the front seam came apart and continued to unravel from that point on. I would have thought this thing would last more than a day. I am sorry I bought it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.....[...]
75475,1,"No body does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. Baby your the best air flow, added H.P. and performance for the money period."
43617,1,"I had borrowed one and used it before so I had a heads up on what to expect. Simple to use. Company has a web site for customer support. I have used it on Chevy and Pontiac brands 1997-2003. For the money you can not beat this, there are some off brand cheap code readers out their that I looked at but why not go with a product that is known to you. Do your own research and you will find that there is nothing out there with the quality and price of these code readers."
103866,0,"We got this shelf to add a bit of much needed space in our rv, and it serves the purpose. Our only real disappointments were quality of the screws that came with it - grooves weren't notched deep enough on some to get a screwdriver in. The real disappointment was that the way the the folding bracket is packaged against the wood shelf, it put several grooves in the wood, though luckily didn't shred the wood. Though the shelf overall is a help, it's still rather small when added to a sink cabinet."
8791,2,"I wish I could recommend this unit but both samples I received from Amazon were damaged. The second was worse than the first due to a broken motor mount. I really wasn't looking for another repair project especially on a brand new product. Amazon issued a refund without any issue. I'm very impressed with Amazon customer service, they are first rate. It seems silly for the manufacturer not to modify the packaging after 3 years of complaints about shipping damage. This has got to be costing them some serious money replacing or scrapping these units."
115980,0,"The plastic box broke as soon as I opened it - cheap garbage. The micrometer itself is okay enough, but is a little rough in spots. You get what you pay for, but in this case it's good enough for measuring stuff like it should. The picture is somewhat different than what I received, so the picture is of some other unit, not the one you'll receive. But it's not material - the picture is close enough and the differences are minor. It's worth $14 or so that this unit is currently priced at."
42317,2,Product is made of very thin material. Multiple pin holes which I think will keep the product from lasting.
58204,1,"The item was shipped regularly and arrived very quick, the product was just as described, excellent price and looks great on my truck!"
138986,1,"This is equivalent to the more expensive Porsche charger if you add the Comfort Connect Cig Plug. It works beautifully as advertised. Also, using the connector clips, you can open your 911 trunk if the battery goes completely dead. A bonus for 911 owners!"

Y gracias al buscador de compatibilidad de Amazon que indica cual es el repuesto preciso. Funciona excelentemente.Saludos, Ali desde Venezuela.Original parts.Hi, I bought this pump and replaced it in my vehicle. I just did that and everything works perfectly. Nothing like the original part. And thanks to ""find parts That fit your vehicle"" from Amazon indicating what the replacement should be. Performs well.Regards, Ali from Venezuela."
150111,0,"The quality of the product was excellent. The driver side floor mat fit perfect. However, the passenger side floor mat didn't quite fit the configuration that I needed for the truck. Doesn't match the picture."
7085,0,"this was not at all what I was looking for. first, it can really only be used with a specific kind of pickup bed, and not any SUV or most other vehicles. Second, the bolts that come with are only enough to entirely attach EITHER the main bracket or 2 in the main bracket, 2 in the support bracket. This would mean the main bracket's strength is compromised. This was easy enough to return though, and looks like it would be good for a pickup truck bed, with the included lock, earning it 2 stars back."
14509,1,Installed the receiver in about 30 minutes on my 2004 Ford Ranger. Fits great. Looks great. Quality/welds were excellent. Highly recommend product.
59045,1,This product is great. Made of real leather and rubber. It is EXTREMELY none slip (I put it through a rigorous test). It looks really sport-like on my truck. Fits 15 inch steering wheels.
125840,0,"The blade and wipping action is good, but the wipper did not fit into the stabilizing tabs on my BMW 330Ci's wipper arms. As a result the ends of the wipper wobble when they are moving across the windsheild."
1890,0,"These are adequate. They could be better with magnets or weights because they won't lay flat when the wind is blowing, and they can be cumbersome to install."
133980,1,fit like a champ. and seems to work better than stock. This filter requires to be Oiled prior to install and does not come with it.
76214,1,Fits on a hi-lift Jack - CHECKKeeps hi-lift Jack handle from rattling - CHECKLooks better than a bungee cord - CHECKEasy to put on if you excel at doing 3D puzzles - CHECKInexpensive - Not as much as I would like
112277,0,"The first time I used the wash/polish kit a while back, it seem to really work.But when recenly I started using this on my new car,I dont seem to get the same result.It leaves behind this weird residue that requires a lot of water to remove and wiping with my microfiber towels.But when its raining and the water is not flowing off your car very well, the polish actually works when you apply it wet.So I use this only when it rains."
171602,0,its not water proof. it just rained and now my cars soaked. the only reason i bought this was to keep the car safe from the rains while i wait for my back window replacement to come. I'm sad. it fits like a charm and is nice and all that but far from waterproof. and i did expect to see a soft interior but its not lined at all. its just one pice of fabric. inside and out are identical. just to let the others out there know.
17415,1,"No more wet carpets, easy to clean. Fits like a glove.These fit so well i got my son a set for his truck!"
167160,0,"The product is nice but the buttons are sort of hard at times when pushed to connect, have to push buttons two or three times before doors unlocks that is why I rated it at a tthree start"
90737,1,"Have used cheaper plugs in my 2002 Ford Escort (Autolite, etc.), you can notice a difference in engine performance (although that's a highly subjective statement).Only other plugs I currently recommend are the bosch."
43819,2,My check engine light recently went on in my car so i brought it to an STS auto center down the street and they wanted $85 just to hook up the computer and diagnose the problem. I decided to go on amazon an look for one similar to this. I have a 99 VW Passat and it dosnt communicate with my computer. The device seems very durable and a good buy but it deffinalty isn't for volkswagens.
30370,1,"Remember, for certain models Jaguars, they really are just Fords.. This was for a 2003 Jaguar S Type, which is under the surface, the same basic auto as the Lincoln LS. (That's sort of beside the point, but I thought I'd mention it)Anyway, it is a genuine Motorcraft product, and buying via Amazon was for an amazingly low price. Shop carefully, make sure you get the right thing, and you're on your way!"
59027,1,I LOVE IT I HAVE THE BACK FLOORS MATS TOO.I LOVE IT . I GOT THE SEAT COVERS AND WHEEL COVER TO MATCH.
99090,2,Bought two cans of this stuff. First used half before and half after the evap. Still stunk! Tried second car but it too did not work.
92202,1,I installed this belt becuase the OEM one was squeeling a lot. After fitting the new belt all problems disappeared. GREAT BELT!
143531,0,"These bulbs are definitely better than OEM, but still not as brite or white as Sylvania would lead you to believe. If you are looking for a replacement bulb that is an upgrade, then these will work fine. If you want true white, or even light blue appearance, these are not for you."
50300,2,"Man I wished it actually did something for my truck, it was cheap and I got it fast but that's the only thing I can say good about it. Save your money, absolutely no change when added to a diesel engine!!!"
171800,2,"Good muffler, but it only will last 3-4 years. I've gone through a couple on my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Walker pipes last less (about 2-3 years)."
17963,1,"This are great for the price. Good for cold weather and commuting. The size is great, not to tight, but snug enough to stay warm. It does not block all the wind, but really depends on what style helmet you wear. I have a full face, so its great. Only struggle is that the full face tends to push it down when putting on your helmet."
120729,1,"This boots look great, and fit really nice on my cv joints.I won't give them the five star, cause they seem to be a little thin, to last long enough.I'll get back to this review, after 6 month of use in my suv, to confirm they still in good shape."
28019,1,"Nice inverter. Fan only runs when it needs to. I've run coffee makers, some power tools with it, fans, lights, etc. This year I ran our Christmas float rope lights through it. Less than 500W load. It was great. While other groups were toddling down the main street with a big noisy generator running (with loudspeakers trying to get the music out over the generator noise) we were rolling along in silence able to hear each other, talk to the bystanders and so forth.Nice added safety margin too - if there was an emergency we would be able to hear someone tells us to stop (for example if a child ran out in the street or someone fell off of the float).There is just about always a 12V solution to most of my needs but I don't generally own those solutions. I know I can buy 12V lights, or a 12V coffee maker or a 12V tool - but rather than do that I just use this inverter instead. I can even run my Milwaukee 3/4"" drill and Sawz-All with this inverter which makes going to the junkyard fun. Can't run with the tool on a heavy load/100% throttle but it gets the job done. When I do these trips I take my larger 1000W inverter now.I've owned another brand inverter since 1994 and it died this year b/c the person I loaned it to did not follow the instructions - always connect the black ground cable first and disconnect it last. Don't let the two DC power leads touch each other b/c the inverter will still have an internal capacitor charged and short circuiting it may fry something. And of course don't ground the A/C plugs (what would normally trip a circuit breaker in a house). I'm not sure what they did to the old 300W inverter but they killed it. Definitely worth reading the instructions.This newer inverter did not mention these safety concerns but I live by these rules."
45755,2,Well the wheel cover did not work it came apart the first day that I used it. When I first looked at it on line there was no measurement as to what size of wheel it was actually for. So I got it and put it on unfortunately it tore and I had to get rid of it any way.
118611,2,"The Omix-Ada 12302.04 Cowl Rubber Seal is thin, flimsy and cheaply made .Have a 92 jeep Wrangler it didnt seal correctly still leaks only in a different areas, not thick enough in the front to seal correctly. I would not recomend this particular brand of seal, your wasting your money.Joe B"
120452,1,"The airlift system was easy to assemble with the detailed instruction that came in the box. It took about two and a half hours to install with out any help, although it shouldn't take more then two hour(a bolt did not want to work with me)if everything dissemble quickly.You don't receive a T valve to inflate the bags evenly, however i find that to be positive since it allows you to level your load if it is distributed unevenly.The ride quality becomes stiffer even with the bags inflated to the 20 psi minimum inflation.Over all this is a good product and i would recommend it to anyone looking to improve there load quality."
33178,1,"I was really unsure about this product before buying. I needed a pump to remove the oil from my Seadoo and had used a drill type before which was always messy and required both hands. I bought the Hydro Turf to give it a try after reading reviews. I did warm up the Seadoo before starting. My Seadoo was on a floating pad connected to my boat dock and after a few pumps the oil was moving. Not real fast but was what I expected. It took maybe 5 minutes to empty the Seadoo oil pan. Best part, NO MESS! All the oil was contained and I was able to pour the oil into disposal container easily with nozzle provided. Great product."

4499,1,"This is a great little device. I had been wanting one of the code-readers for my car for a while to debug problems when they come up and just never got around to it. I came across Scanguage, read up on it, and gave it a try. Basically you get the code-reading plus the extras of engine/vehicle information on the fly for just a little more than a normal handheld scanner/code-reader.Some of the info really doesn't matter unless you're specifically looking for it. Coolant temperature, for example - unless you've recently done some work on your radiator, thermostat, or water pump you probably won't care about it. Even then, you can pretty much tell what you need looking at the on-dash temperature guage. All you really care about is, ""Is it in the red?"" Still, it's kind of cool that the information is there and if that gauge is broke this could fill in.Outside of the engine status you do get trip information which can be useful when you're traveling down the road. The way that the Scanguage handles it really makes the most sense for most people. You get trip info based on: most recent trip, today's data, yesterday's data, or tank data. It resets this all of this automatically based on some pretty common-sense parameters. The only input you really need to provide is when you fillup your tank.You can easily take the trip data, which is normally shown as one-item-per-screen in the trip-section and show it listed in one of the 4-gauge-per-screen sections using XGauge. It's pretty easy to set it up. The worst part is trying to come up with 3-character codes to show the difference between them. For example, you already get real-time MPG. If you set up an extra gauge (XGauge) for MPG based on trip, today, yesterday, or tank, then you'll need to come up with a 3-character code to differentiate them (you don't have to, I think it'll take MPG all three times but then how would you, as the user, know which is which).The box isn't very big but if you velcro it to the front of your dash it's going to stick out a little. You could place it on the steering column up by the instrument panel or, if you do Google 'Blendmount' you'll find that you can attach it to your rear-view mirror which is what I did. Looks nice, out of the way, and doesn't interfere (get in the way/block) any of my normal gauges.As others have said, I'd recommend going through the settings for engine/tank size and doing that first tank-calibration just so that all of your data is accurate. You do it once and forget it.What it really boils down to is that it's a great trip-computer that has a bonus of being able to tell you some other information about your engine or service-engine codes (and reset them) and the install is minimal as you just plug it in and route the wire."
119297,1,"I could not find this in previous reviews, and the product information on this was less than helpful. I ended up buying one box because it was not clear to me how many clips came in a box. The answer is two - at least for the Q128. I haven't installed on my VW CC yet, as I now have an order in for a second box. Anyway - submitted this feedback to Amazon. Note that the box clearly indicates a pair once you get it; however the generic picture on the site doesn't (understandably you get a generic image since there are a multitude of models)."

107894,2,"I triple checked DENSO and AMAZON web pages for the front end O2/Fuel sensors. They say 234-9007 and 234-9009 are ""correct"" front end sensors for 2000 Camry V6. NOT. The correct sensor is 234-4626 for both banks. The -9007 and -9009 sensors trigger CHECK ENGINE light. KEY - The electric connector ""TABS"" are slightly different. If they don't match the original, DON'T use it. I matched up the TAB configuration for the electric connector on the DENSO web page, which indicated the -4626. My bad ... I shaved the ""tab"" ends to make the -07 and -09 fit. I now have quasi-new aprox $200 of sensor junk. Paying for an education in O2 sensor hell :-)) Good Luck."

48658,0,AS1300 is a good buy for the price and is satisfactory for around the house usage. I use it for pumping up wheelbarrow and bicycle tires primarily. Also use it for pumping auto tires to 35 lbs which takes a few minutes. The negatives are pretty much what I have read from other reviewers: the air hose too short and the inflator is really noisy.
135487,1,"The car mats are really great. I just purchased a new Nissan Altima and wanted to protect the mats in the car. These are a light weight, but very nice quality mat. They cover well and only folds a teeny bit on the driver's side due to the bump to left for foot rest on car. The nice rubber padding is a plus on the driver's mat. I am very satisfied and this is a great price for the quality. Highly recommend them!"

13688,0,"These things are awesome --- when you first heat them up. I went to a 2 hour tailgate before a game and by the time we settled in at the stadium they were barely warm and were nothing more than seat cushions (very comfortable ones I'll admit). If you're going straight to a game I highly recommend. If there is going ot be any sort of delay, they last about 3 hours before the heat really goes out"
27649,2,"This is the SECOND time I have been OFFERED this product via e-mail, and the first time I was sent one set, and then later told there would be no more. That item was returned. Then I received ANOTHER e-mail and I attempted to order another two sets. Guess what.....only ONE was available. ONE SET does me no good. I'll buy the product elsewhere since I can no longer depend on Amazon's service. I used to be a loyal and frequent buyer....now I am just a ""sometimes"" buyer...for obvious reasons."

It looks good, and is a great code reader/multifunction guage/trip computer. i have mine display water temp (my car has no temp guage), voltage (so i can know when I have to turn the radio off or the engine on when using my car as a boombox or flashlight) and instant and average fuel economy.

98343,2,"Every other air tool comes ready to take a 1/4"" NTP male connector, which are very common. This one requires a 1/4"" female. Just be aware. What a PITA if you don't have one handy. Otherwise, the gauge is about you'd expect from a cheap Chinese factory."
132691,2,Well the price is right but the page and description was hard to understand. It said product feature of six and said pack of 1 so I thought it would come for 1 pasck of six for the price. Add was very misleading and hard to follow. Needs to be fixed becareful when looking at this product
167213,2,"When this 15oz can of product is fully dispensed - there is only about 7.24 ounces of actual product that reamins. The rest is propellant, carrier and dispersant. This was tested by using a 7 foot length of 1"" OD flexible tubing that has an ID of .75. When measured after fully dispensing the product there is about 7.24 ounces left of actual parts cleaner. Buying a case of this product will yield you about 86.8 ounces of parts cleaner versus 180 ounces of gross product. I'm using ounces as a measure of volume, not weight. Most of what you are paying for is evaporated as the product is dispensing. Talking to many mechanics, the reason they like this product is because they believe it's in-expensive. I'll let the public decide."
38352,1,"I just installed it in my Jeep automatic transmission pan during a fluid change, had fluid every where when I removed the pan, this wont be a problem next time, the pan will be near empty. I wont know how well it works until I drive another 30,000 miles and do the next fluid change, but I am sure it wont be getting all over me."
168653,1,The jacket came earlier than I expected which was a pleasent surprise. Looking over the jacket I was impressed by the workmanship. After trying it on it fit just as expected. It was surprisingly comfortable and lightweigth. I wore it on a chilly day around 55 degrees and it kept me pretty warm. I look forward to taking the liner out and wear it on a warmer day. Overall it was one of the better purchases I have made. Tourmaster/Cortech makes an outstanding product.
134256,1,"We often leave the garden hose lying across the driveway. Believe me it's not the best place for it. We have had to replace nozzles once too often because one of us would inadvertently drive the car over them, resulting in them splitting. Ever since I found this new product I don't have to worry about broken hoses anymore. The rubber encasing keeps the hose from damage."
169379,2,This item is Cheap Cheap Cheap and no just in price. Cheap plastic body with cheap rubbery plastic suction cups. Would not stick to anything. After pay more shipping and handling than the price of the item.....I looked into returning it only to find that I would have to pay shipping on return.....
18194,1,I looked everywhere on and offline for a dash cover or mat or carpet for my Moms car. Dash mat is a product I have used and purchased in the past. I was happy with the Dash Mat I purchased this time as far as quality of the product . I was disappointed that everywhere I turned I could not get a color picture of the actual color of the Dash Mat I get that maybe there were only a couple of colors and I think a couple might look good either way . None the less because I wasn't shown a full bill of goods so to speak I have to deduct 1 star for not giving all the info. The product Dash Mat is an awesome product otherwise as it cools your dash off and keeps even dust fom being a big problem but the biggie is the lowering of solar radiation through the windshield . As a resident of Arizona I can appreciate even a few degrees lowered temp on a110 degree day.
21292,2,"I got this horn to replace the mechanically damaged OEM horn in my F-150. Install is easy for anyone with a little mechanical aptitude -- you can pretty much bolt it to anything. Given the item description and the first page of reviews, I expected this thing to sound awesome. I should have read the next few pages of reviews. This thing does not sound ""like a Mack truck"". It doesn't even sound like a Nissan pickup. I would definitely characterize it's tone as ""weep weep"". It's almost more of a whistle than a horn. The worst thing about this horn is that it has about 1/2 second spool-up time. That means that when the horn chirps when you lock the doors and the like, this horn doesn't actually sound and all you hear is the compressor start to spool up and then stop. You can't chirp the horn from inside either -- like to politely remind the car in front of you that the light is green. The only thing you can do is lay on the horn like a jerk. Even worse, if you actually need the horn, often you don't have 1/2 second to wait for the compressor to do its thing. Long story short, I'll leave this horn in the truck to pass state inspection next week, but after that, I'll be replacing it with something more appropriate to the size of the vehicle and more importantly, something that makes a horn-like noise as soon as I hit the button."
34208,2,"I was doing a multi-state move from Louisiana to California, and the bag ripped just outside San Antonio. It tore along the seams, and in the bag were mostly clothes. However, until then the bag seemed pretty good, and was sturdy.My suggestion is that anyone who purchases this needs to assess how far the bag will be expected to go. This is not a heavy-duty bag, and shouldn't have much weight packed into it. Luckily I got a full refund on it, and the company handled the return very well."

60039,1,My original radiator from my 75 duster leaked and would cost more than twice the amount of a replacement. So I researched radiators and found this Spectra to be the best for both fit and cost. It installed perfectly and without any issues. I definately would recommend this product.
65749,2,"I bought one of these things a few years ago... and as many other reviews have noted... it does not heat air... it only makes it less cold. It is a complete waste of money. When I bought it, they advertised it as something you could heat your car with and defrost your windows with, but it is only good at one thing... barely moving cold air while heating it to just a few degrees warmer than it was originally. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
149902,1,I bought a new soft top convertible and had no clue how to keep the top clean. I did lots of research and found this product. I like how the cleaner washes the top (remembering to use a soft brush along with it). After dried the top protector does awesome from keeping water off the top. Definitely an item to purchase to keep dirt and mold off the soft top.
127227,2,I found two problems with this item: (1) The instruction booklet is unintelligible to the average person; (2) Neither I nor my car savvy friend were able to jump start a lawn tractor battery (although his 15-year-old Schumacher charger worked perfectly). I'm glad I purchased through Amazon since they took the product back and credited my account without any difficulties.
34193,1,"I bought this for extra space for a camp trip, and my car doesn't have a roof rack. After looking at the item, I was pretty sure I could jury rig it to fit without a roof rack. When I open the box I noticed that it had hardware so it could be attached without a roof rack or other permanent installation. I was amazed at how much I was able to put inside, and the padded bottom was great for protecting the paint job on the roof. Maximum weight is 100 pounds. Unsuprisingly gas mileage dropped slightly, but overall the drop wasn't that bad for me."
10143,1,"This jacket is great. I kind of regret getting the white one because it will get dirty faster than the black or blue, but the jacket is very good. I am a Florida driver and when you take the inside liner out and open the vents you can stay fairly cool knowing that you have titanium and top quality elbow pads as protection. The inside liner can keep you very warm, but don't be mistaken, this isn't a winter jacket. Great buy. The white is really nice, I am just worried about going through a patch of bugs. So far it has been a month and is perfectly clean, but I will see later when the bugs come out. The look is a little...hmmm...muscular? if that makes sense. Sometimes I feel like I am wearing a fake muscle suit, but if that doesnt bother you, I would strongly recommend the jacket."

A second try revealed the same problem."

55709,0,It is a cool cushion all right. But barely! King Size? I don't think so. Not much internal spring ventilation which make cool cushions so popular.

172551,1,The quality and fit are good. I will know more after they sit outside for a year or two and see if they hold up well to the weather. They do have a three year guarantee.
98962,1,Needed this tool to remove filter on a 2011 Subaru Forester that I just couldn't swing any other wrench on. This tool is very nice quality and in my opinion a very good design. Grabs small filter diameter very well.
24441,0,"We purchased this product as it was the only ones we could find in a hurry to fit a 2008 F-150. The major draw back is the extreme viberation while traveling down the road, about the only thing you can see if there is something behind you but you so they serve the purpose also they do slip on the mirrow but have not came off even at interstate highway speeds. The statement you get what you pay for fits this product to a ""T"""
114327,1,So far so good. This product has not disappointed me in anyway with the tests I have done with it.
104264,1,"I don't usually write reviews, but this one is deserving.The stock filter has foam around the periphery to seal it. The K&N; filter uses a rubber wedge / protrusion, and fit very tight in the slot. Definitely use the supplied lube to install it. Seals really well.Also noticed the engine vibrations decreased slightly with my 2010. Vibs from the handlebars when cruising in 6th gear at 60 MPH dropped. Now I don't feel that level of vibration unless I drop to 4th gear at that speed. Sweet! Also, the sale price was only $11 more than a replacement stock filter, and this one is a lifetime filter!Shipping was super fast too. I ordered it on a Friday with the 5 to 8 day free shipping option, and received it on Monday (3 days later). Very happy with this purchase. Even posted about it on two major forums, and dozens of members bought them (Hey, maybe I get a commission here :) )."
162376,2,The mat itself is nice and strong. But to put the edges on is a night mare. The last one we owned was much better
13528,2,"This was gonna be the first time for me to install step rails on my vehicle and, according to friends and family, I thought it was going to be easy as pie. When the items arrived, I ran into a lil problem. The mount kit for this item IS WRONG! I order these step rails plus the mount kit that amazon suggested for my vehicle and it was wrong. The brackets don't even look like the picture plus the kit came with extra hardware that kept confusing me. OH!!! and don't get me started on the ""INSTRUCTIONS""! THOSE WERE A WASTE OF PAPER!!! Didn't help one bit. I thought the point of instructions is to guide you through the installation. I think they were trying to use pictures to guide me but with the extra hardware, it became impossible. To make sure that I didn't order the incorrect mount kit by mistake, I checked out the ""lund"" website. It told me that, for my vehicle, I had the correct mount kit. So to make sure it wasn't just me, I took it to a professional. They were the ones that confirmed my initial thought that I had the incorrect mount kit and that the kit was actually for an older model. So I think that the Lund company needs to check this out. Now I have to return both items. >.&lt; Hope this review helps."

25248,0,"The kit works great to add a little kick with few extra HP for steep hills. Problem was the two longer bolts supplied to secure air cleaner assembly to engine with the 25mm spacers were the worng size.Easy fix: Instead of using supplied longer bolts, use the two bolts (removed earlier) that secure the throttle body to the intake manifold."
182321,1,installation time was fast and easy no more than 15 minutes and it was done. no cutting or splicing except for drilling a hole for the ground wire. works great!

111926,2,I was using these jacks to lift a 3000 sedan on a clean level garage.The teath on the first jack bent after about 1/4 the way up.The second jack collapsed while lowering the car. This would have killed anyone under the car. The screw that drives the jack striped and exploded out of the jack.

121943,1,"I purchased it used, under $150 and described as minor cosmetic damage,got it and saw no damage, full seemingly brand new kit (even stickers). Install took about an hour (thanks for recent reviews regarding using that stock clamp) and its got a great sound, better response, and maybe a TAD bit of power increase, but on our 2.2 slowbalts sound is all you can hope for, want speed get a faster car. oh i drive a 07 stock ls. Great buy, go for it if you want a good sound."
165784,1,"WOW!! That's about all I can say!! I've looked and looked at saddlebags and have priced them for quite some time before finding these on Amazon. Let me just say, you get more than your money's worth in this ensemble! Every place I've looked wants upwards of $70, just for the saddlebags alone. This gives you so much more, for far less! I'm incredibly happy and satisfied with this purchase!"
168350,1,This works exactly as advertised. Good finish. I like the adjustablity of the step and using this on an old truck it makes reaching things very easy.
48281,1,This sun visor is Cool you can put anything to it that that small. I Like it I like it.
130414,2,I have had these wipers for about 4 months on my Jeep Wrangler.Pros: They clean the glass and very easy to install.Cons:Big Problem: They make horrible squeaking noise when windshield is not completely covered in water. I thought that was because they were new however the problem still persists.Would not recommend.
98106,1,I ordered this model specifically because it was supposed to be the 64mm model but a 65mm model arrived. It seemed to fit fine and had adequate torque to do the job without stripping the threads. Way better price than local sources...if you can even find one.
8030,1,"the product came in perfect condition and on time, thanks to the trial period of Amazon Prime."
84122,1,"The KD Tools Oil seal Remover/Installer offers a little known method of removing oil seals in antique auto engines. While the standard procedure is to remove the crankshaft, it IS possible to replace the seal with the crankshaft in place. The KD tool set allows the user to first remove the old seal. Next, the ""chinese fingers"" are inserted over the top of the crankshaft and the new seal is retained by the finger trap. Using liberal amounts of lubricant, one pulls the new seal into place with the ""chinese fingers"" device included in the tool kit. It helps to slowly turn over the engine by hand (you'll need an assistant) while pulling the new seal into place following the direction of rotation. The old timers knew this routine - and it still works!"
141111,1,Needed this for the Autometer LED gauges in my Subaru because they won'tdim when hooked into the car dimming circuit (due to the groundingsystem used i believe). Probably would need one to use Autometer gaugesin Hondas and other Asian vehicles also.Easy installation. Just be careful to connect ONLY the white illuminationwire from the dimmer to the illumination contact on the gauges or you maydamage the dimmer.
72269,1,K&N filter are without a doubt the finest filters for the money. Super easy to install and this filter has both increased my gas milage on my bike but most importantly it increased my horsepower. I didn't know that my bike was so responsive until l installed this filter. Worth the money!!!!!
169109,0,Used this mask skiing in December in Korea; good on moderately cold days but would condensate on the real cold days and freeze to my face. Nice novelty but get something different for the slopes.
19127,2,"Concerning the BOA Remote Start Systemwith Keyless EntryBeen working on an installation in a 2003 Toyota 4Runner.Would not do this again !!! The instruction manual is incorrect and missing much data. I have had to contact Tech support several times (once was waiting 1.5 hours to get connected) and the tech support seems to know product but not sure why the installation instructions are not clear.Their web site was incorrect on the module that was required to override the immobilizer system. I can not return the wrong module and had to purchase the correct one. Tech support admits the web site was incorrect and stated they will tell their web master. I should have taken the product back after all their disclaimers about they will not be responsible for incorrect information!!!!! If you attempt you will find this is an installation you will NEVER forget. So far I have 24 Hours involved in the installation and still have not got the correct immobilizer module to work. Hopefully the installation has not fried something like the ECM (ie ~$1000.00).Don't fall for this cheap hardware, you will pay for it in installation cost or time...."
43108,1,Product works as advertised. Does not push water around...its actually soaks it right up. It's so big you don't even have to ring it out often. Works perfectly for the car.
15666,1,"Nothing wrong with this bulb - works fine and it is the Hella model/item number listed in the heading. However, as of this moment, the photo shows a twin-pack of ""xenon blue"" Hella bulbs ""Made in Germany"". The actual item that arrived was a single conventional halogen bulb in a yellow cardboard box made by Hella ""in India"". As I said, it works well and the price is very good - but don't expect a pair of the fancier ""xenon blue"" bulbs for this price."
114037,0,"Bought this for a 1982 Yamaha 650 Seca. Fits properly, but wish it came pre-oiled like other K&N filters. The informational sheet says to use 3/4 of the oil packet, but following K&N's directions to oil every crease, I easily used the entire tube."
27467,1,"Nice quality heavy duty steel, very nice finish. Fit 1994 Ford F-150. Easier to install than I originally thought, just have a good set of drill bits, a couple of large ""C"" clamps, and a floor jack ready. Didn't even need to remove spare tire for the installation. The metal plates that hold the carrige bolts make the installation easier and allow you to tighten the nuts with a single wrench. Great idea!"
18384,2,"Good white it lasted, but after just over a year (stored indoors), the Mityvac 7400 developed a leak in two areas that rendered the unit useless.FIRST LEAK:This occurred between the handle and the metal downpipe. Oil would literally flow out during a single pump. Messy.SECOND LEAK:This leak is almost as bad as the first. It occurs at the hole on the cap where the metal downpipe goes into the unit. Again, oil leaks out of it.When you combine the both leaks, it's a horrible mess! When I called Mityvac, their response made it seem like they had heard this before. It seems like there's no development in the product to resolve this problem. A known issue has been ignored. I'd recommend you turn to another competing product if you want something more reliable."
10935,0,it works well but it does not have as good of a seal as the oem filter
73017,2,I wrote the person that sold me this no reply 2 times i was going to open a case but decided they wouldn't let me return because i hooked it up but looks like the seal around the lighs are mushed out a bit and the screws well they arent all the way in on two places and i coudn't get them to go in so they are cheap made but they give off good light brighter then low beam silver star premiums in my caddy i would like a replacement but the cool thing is the dual beams you could put the high end 100 watt bulbs in both sides and have really good lighting. I just cant becausse the screws are messed up.
37758,1,I put these into my 1977 Chevy 4x4 and they look great. The fit is perfect. I use my truck for the Car Cruise's in my area and they sure stand out when looking at the interior of the vehicle. They are also heavy duty and will lay where you place them.
3391,1,"The Bosch oxygen sensor has a slightly different shape and length at the ""probe/sensor"" end, but threads in fine and has matching connector assembly as compared to the original OEM Denso sensor on my 2001 Lexus LX470. I bought it with the recommended slotted socket. Removal and replacement went smoothly and the Bosch sensor is working perfectly."
102650,0,"Bought this cover because my Lab likes to ride to work with me. I have leather seats and with her moving around so much, this cover tends to slide down. I have made modifications to it; it needs a strap that snaps around the head-rest bars to keep it from slipping down, and something more on the bottom part than one small strap in front (that hooks to what??). The bottom, the part that she sits on, only has the one strap in the center, so the corners fold up or slide around.The material and construction are great, but it might be a little too simple to effectively protect my seats. I'd say with a few tweaks, they'd have 5 stars."
169111,1,"I bought these for my nephews who play with Air-soft guns and they loved them. The quality was nice, however they look a little weird when we first got them out and the fit is a little large of 12yr and 14yr old boys, but they for the price not too much to complain about."
111003,1,Nice to finally have this in large quantity! Also used it to clean BBQ tools with sparkling success! When I run out I'm definitely ordering a new one!
135141,0,i bought it because i will need it and not have it and also i would forget where i found it and i do plan on buying a nother in do time
174707,0,"The head of the breaker bar is rather poorly and unevenly finished. It is hand ground and looks like the tool worker was inexperienced. Consequently, the head has a slightly lopsided look. Maybe they are not all this way but, well, mine is. The square drive is painted a shiny black instead of finished with matte black oxide like most other brands of breaker bars (except, of course, chromed ones). As someone else already mentioned, it is made in China and the knurled handle is the same diameter as the rest of the shaft. That can make it less comfortable when applying a lot of torque. That said, it has worked for the mild use I've put it to so far. The real test will be the next time I have a tight crankshaft bolt to loosen such as on Hondas or some Toyotas. I have other breaker bars made in USA and a couple made in Taiwan. They all are superior in quality to this one. If I had seen it in person in a store, I don't think I would have bought it.Edit: I have since used this breaker bar to successfully break loose a crankshaft bolt on a Toyota pickup 4 cyl using a 4 ft. cheater (pipe). With a loud crack noise, the bolt gave way. I held the balancer still using Toyota factory tools. While I had other name brand breaker bars to choose from, I wanted to test this one. The breaker bar came out undamaged, unbent and unscathed. I've also used it to break loose stubborn rack and pinion mounting bolts on a Toyota Camry using two people pushing and pulling on it (no cheater used due to limited room). Despite its uneven workmanship, surprisingly it has held up for me.Edit: Have now used this to break loose a Honda crank bolt with the help of a cheater pipe. Worked great. Just be sure to slide the cheater pipe all the way down to the breaker bar drive head to avoid stressing the bar shaft. That way it won't bend. Also used Powerbuilt pulley holding tool bought from Amazon."
70110,0,A decent product for the money. Not a perfect fit though. Needs a little tweaking on the studs.
120035,0,Its ok but I miss my old one which was wider and darker. This one doesn't seem to come down far enough down on thw window.
124761,0,"I bought this for a Harley Sportster and the installation has been a serious hassle.First, the horn is large and awkward and they state that it must be vertical and the intakes must be facing backward, but the horn only has a single mounting option so it was very difficult finding a spot on a motorcycle to place it.Second, the instructions state 40ft-lbs of torque required, but the cheap metal from which they made the the bracket cracked after about 20ft-lbs.I still have not found a place on my bike to mount this awkward-cracked beast-horn and without a machine shop to fabricate a bracket, it looks unlikely. So, I reinstalled my old horn and I still sound like the road runner (meep meep).As for function, I tried it for volume both with and without the relay. The relay makes a big difference, but adds a bit of hassle when wiring. Depending on how your machine is wired, the diagram may be wrong. If you understand that your old horn button actuates the 85/86 circuit, which relays to the 87/30 and actuates this horn, you should be fine. With the relay, the horn is a loud two tone blast that will definitely get noticed. It sounds a bit like a locomotive horn. Pretty sweet... if you can attach it.I would welcome any tips on attaching this horn."
32228,1,"My vehicle has 110K and my mileage was getting worse daily but no check engine light but I figured that it was time to replace the upstream O2 sensors. I was looking at ACDelco but the cost was a little high because I needed two sensors. I ended up installing two Bosch Premium sensors and they fit perfectly in the exhaust and at the connectors. My old sensors looked pretty bad so I think it was time they were changed. I don't have a scan tool to compare the old verses the new but I can say the truck does idle better and the old right bank sensor was running hotter than the left bank and that could be because the sensor was skewed or lazy. I will see if my mileage gets better or any codes pop up and let you know. The picture is not correct at all,the connector is square and white and the shaft is solid if you want a better picture go to the Bosch.com site and you can compare pictures. By the way I did do some reading on Bosch O2 sensors and I liked what I read but like I said time will tell."
60212,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
114532,1,this is a amazing tool i have used older versions of it in the past but this one goes far beyond it can give you voltage reading as well as supply power to parts in your vehicle and out of it perfect for testing down the line and it comes with a very long cord to hook to your battery ! this item is a must have !
79579,0,"I had to grind down the ""pin"" section on the bolt end end almost 1/2 and inch to get it to pass through the 2"" factory hitch receiver on my 2008 Toyota Tundra otherwise I couldn't get the locking end cap on. This thing would be perfect if the pin section was a little longer, I was surprised it was too short. Toyota wraps the outside of the hitch receiver with a layer of metal for the safety chains and that makes thicker than everything else.. after I modified by grinding it down with a 4"" circular grinder it works great."
143593,0,1996 to 1999 Chrysler/Dodge minivan owners have to live with weak headlight configurations. The overburdened single bulb provides both high and low beams in a poorly designed mirror/housing lens.Over years the plastic lens fog/pit from road debris along with the OEM bulbs yellowing. Replacing the inexpensive (aftermarket +/-$40) lens housing is relatively easy for the DIYer. Coupled with these Sylvania bulbs and one approaches the original brightness of showroom fresh headlight brightness. But do not expect more.

146284,1,"Product description says it comes with connection tips to recharge cell phones. It does not. One other reviewer said you have to call Eton to get such.

Maybe the cell phone tips????"

129121,0,i bought this to use on my solar system to monitor my batteries and so far it has done a decent job and the 3 led charge lights were more helpful than i thought they would be. its not ideal since it cant be mounted in a console but it will work and the adjustable screen does come in handy.
1274,1,"Bought this air filter to replace the stock one. Arrived on time and the fit was good. Have only ridden the bike a few times since the install , but so far all seems good."
158667,2,"It took about 4 hours to install this on a 2004 Kia Optima. I was disappointed to find that this product has some deficiencies and I was frustrated that I could not quite get the edges to meet all the way around my steering wheel.1. The picture for this product clearly shows the text on the box stating ""EXTRA WIDE SUPERSKIN"", however after receiving it apparently the #58-0600B is the medium size cover, not the EXTRA WIDE SUPERSKIN. Only because the leather is overlapped along the edges, is a bit stretchable, and it is very strong, was I able to use waxed lacing (see my comment #2) to pull the lacing very tight to make the gap very small.2. I began with the standard thread and it was not working well and did not look good. The lacing that is provide is not waxed, it does not look right for this application and it appears a bit cheap. While it seems very strong, it does not allow you to really maintain tension for a tight fit as you stretch and stitch the cover. Only because I had waxed lacing, from another (less expensive) wheel cover, was I able to maintain enough tension to keep this stretched tightly enough to keep the gap very small, however, I could not quite eliminate it all the way around. The manufacturer should provide the proper WAXED lacing for this application.3. I appreciated that they did provide two needles with the kit and very good detailed instructions that included various stitching methods. I chose to cross stitch using two needles, however, the needles provided did not work well with either type of lacing. The eyes were too small and even after melting the end of the lacing and pulling the molten plastic thread to a small point, it was very difficult to get the lacing through the eyes. Again, I was saved by having similar needles with bigger eyes from prior installations of other wheel covers, including Wheelskins. The better needles saved a great deal of frustration and some time. The manufacturer should provide needles that are easier to use.4. The leather is not soft or supple to the touch like a Wheelskins brand cover. It is a very pebble grained and a bit rough to the touch. In the manufacturer's defense they don't advertise Superskin as ""soft"" or ""supple"". I have gotten used to it and if I had to market it I would call it ""grippy"".Overall, for the price, I am barely satisfied, but only because I had better needles and lacing."

The water either splattered too hard or trickled out too slowly. There is not a nice softer spray to effectively water plants. Okay, I thought to myself, ""Maybe this will work great to hose down the patio."" Wrong again. I put the fire hose type nozzle back on so I could get a lot of pressure. Now I am mystified why this nozzle is getting great reviews. My $7 hose sprayer is back on my hose so I can easily water my plants. Maybe the nozzle will last a long time, but it won't make a difference to me. I am no longer using it."

Maybe cut it off someday and resew the piping to make it look like a professional job.As I've said in another review, Dashmat products we ordered on Amazon don't seem to be the quality they once were.

14053,1,I purchased a 4 1/2 year old black focus that looked like it was never garaged or cleaned. After bringing it to the car wash I waxed it with this cleaner/wax because I wanted to remove oxidized paint. It worked well but did not remove the very tiny pits on the hood and roof nor did it leave black residue on the cloth (I assume the focus has a clear coat). It was easy to apply and remove and did not leave white reside in the gaps between panels. Also worked well to remove the oxidized paint on the wipers and cleaned the plastic over the head lights well. I will change my review to 5 stars if it lasts for 6 months. I would purchase this product again.

The gutters that the clips hang on to are slanted, so I worried about the rack popping off while I was traveling, but after cinching down my load and traveling 5 hours at high speed, I can tell you the rack performed marvelously! When I arrived at my destination, it was a breeze to take the rack off the car and toss it into the back seat. While the first-time setup took ~20 minutes, subsequent setups took &lt;5 mins.There was one notable drawback when traveling at speed. It was deafeningly loud til I covered the holes...The unused holes that are used to mount the bar to the rack's feet (there are 3 options on each end of the bar so it can accommodate narrow or wide cars) basically turned the whole rack into a giant flute! By the time I reached 50mph, I couldn't hear anything! A little packing tape over the unused holes cut the noise right out...I love this rack, and it works well with both of my vehicles!"

This time when I called Amazon they said I should have kept the first box and combined it with the second. So... I kept the second box and Amazon sent me a third. This box had all the parts.The install was easy. The product is very heavy-duty constructions and it works well. The only complaint I have is the front mounting bracket is not completely level to the square steel beam. This causes the attachment to be slightly off kilter. I was able to adjust for it but it took a little extra work."
129958,0,"This unit is a great idea and it works fine for pulling used oil out of vehicles.I've used it to drain oil and transmission fluid from several vehicles, and it can save a lot of time.I did not have any luck changing old cutting oil from an old milling machine - The oil was sludged up and I couldn't get it out with this.My complaint is I've not been able to get mine sealed up, and frustratingly, it often leaks all over the place, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid in buying it.The problem is they use plastic compression fittings on the pvc tubes to seal them, and they just don't work well. Mine leaks continuously on the main fitting for the inlet/outlet on top of the tank, which causes it to have low suction and oil to leak all over the outside of the tank and down to the floor. I've tried to seal the fitting every way I know, and can't get it to stop leaking. A couple times when I messed with it, I pulled the tube out of the fitting, blowing motor oil all over the place.I think if I they replaced them with some metal compression fittings it would work much better. I've got some stainless wrapped flexible hose left over from a project and I'm going to try and fit that to the main inlet/outlet of the Evacuator and see if I can't get a seal that won't leak.I really like the device and if I can get it to work without leaking, I would recommend it without reservation. However until they put better fittings on it 3 stars."
166954,1,"Easy to install and use, but you will need a 22mm deep socket to properly install. I did have a leaking problem after I first installed the plug, but I attribute that to the fact that I didn't have the necessary deep socket to use with my torque wrench. Once reinstalled however, no problems at all and oil changes are a cinch. We'll see how the plug holds up over time, but for now this is a five star product."

98726,1,"The stripe kit is really good quality and gives the truck a more sporty appearance. A tip when installing the stripe for the do it your selfers, when applying the stripe use the ""dry application"" method and not the ""wet application"" method. It does not state on the packaging as to which method if preferred but if using the ""wet"" application the striping will not adhere to the vehicles body. You will need to let everything dry out and apply the stripe on the vehicle when nice and dry. All in all it's pretty easy to put on. You can find installation instructions using the ""dry"" method on You tube."

69822,1,"My vehicle is a 1999 Honda Civic. I've also used NGK plugs on: 1988 Honda Accord, 1999 Subaru Forester, and a 2000 Toyota Sienna, with excellent results across the board.I love working on cars, and spend a LOT of time reading blogs by mechanics, enthusiasts, etc. I've consistently read that NGK makes the best plug, especially for Japanese cars. You'd think that after a century, all plugs would be alike and they'd be a commodity product. Apparently not.After installing this set of plugs, I ended up calling NGK with a technical question...buried in a PDF* rom NGK, which I accessed online, you're NOT supposed to apply anti-seize to most of their plug threads, as they already have a special coating from NGK. The two main problems are (a) over-torquing effect, and (2) too much anti-seize causing misfiring. The tech and I decided my applying only a little anti-seize and not going bonkers with tightening probably meant all was well. Things have been fine since I installed them a week ago. I was amazed to get a human at NGK, by the way...and a polite, knowledgeable one at that.I went with the platinums because they're supposed to last longer than the NGK Iridiums I was replacing. The NGK tech told me the Iridiums were ""aftermarket, with only one precious metal, while the platinums have both the center and ground electrode made of platinum"" in response to my asking why the platinums were a bit more money.I'd add that spark plugs are one link in your ignition system. If you have an old, worn distributor/rotor (my '99 Honda does) or old ignition wires (NGK makes good, affordable ones - wayyyy better than the generic crap at most auto parts stores, IMO), new plugs may not solve your problem. Do yourself a favor and replace them all.NGK (8028) HE73 Premium Spark Plug Wire Set* it's called ""Tech Bulletin - Anti-Seize Compounds on Spark Plug Threads"" so just search for it. Amazon won't let me post the link."

Once i figured out you could i put it in a 2 gauge bezel replacement for a 98 eclipse gst. The hoses are stiff and scary to work with. The gauge is made of cheap metal but do the job. Don't know how accurate it is but it's where it said my car should be with its stock turbo. Didn't hook up the back lights yet. One saving grace is that the needle + number colors match the stock needles + numbers color in the dash. Buy a better gauge if not only for better hoses and connectors.

I can do most of the mixing rolling it with my feet, so it gets rid of the back strain of mixing in a wheel barrel. Other than that, it's just not worth it to me.I am making paving stones and can only do 1 bag per day (because of the number of molds I have), if you are going to be in the same kind of situation, do it the old fashioned way. Between the extra cleaning, lack of mixing sometimes and the finished product not being as strong, it's just not worth the hassle."

After having carefully prepared the surfaces to be taped (by cleaning with alcohol thoroughly) and making sure there was no residual film, the two surfaces (ceramic and plastic) were pushed together and held together for at least two hours with a clamp. This tape released the surfaces within two days. The old tape it was replacing lasted several years (a Scotch product). This tape was purchased because of the size: 3/4"" by 5 feet. Most tapes are an inch wide. Needless to say, I threw the tape away and replaced it with a Scotch product. So far so good. For me this tape was a waste of time and money."

163170,1,"Dorman OE Solutions Window Regulator with Motor 741-644First of all, I was shocked. When I did a google for the window regulator for the shop truck, Amazon was the 2nd name to appear. We have been using Rock Auto usually, due to name brand parts and the lowest prices. However - when we checked Amazon, we couldn't believe the price difference.For the same brand (Dorman) most everyone had it for $80 - 110 without the window motor, and up to $140 w/ the motor - Amazon had the same regulator - WITH the motor - for $66.48.Since we weren't in a rush (and watching pennies) we went w/ their 'Super Saver' FREE shipping, which is supposed to take beyond 4-5 business days to ship - HA! Ordered on a Saturday, got it that MONDAY! Part went right in (Dorman makes a good product) and the window is faster than it ever was.So . . . part is $45-$85 cheaper than anyone else, we saved another $20 for oversized shipping, name brand warranteed product, and I can put my window down @ the ATM (or to receive that speeding ticket!LOL) It's a winner straight down the line.

89988,1,"I read the Consumer Report article that reviewed Slick 50 when it first came out. They had several high mileage engines that they had treated with Slick 50 per manufacturers instructions, and then drained them of oil while the engines continued to run. They waited for the engines to seize up so they could then break them apart and assess their wear patterns. The engines did not overheat, and would not seize up. They finally decided to stop the engines and dismantle the engines. There was no appreciable wear noted. This sold me. (Sorry I don't remember the exact month and year of the Consumer Report issue.)Later in ~1986, I was on board the USS Carl Vinson as an enlisted man. While reminiscing during watch, the person with whom I was conversing told me how he had added Slick 50 to his engine in Idaho Falls, Idaho. He had his oil changed later just prior to traveling down to Alemeda, CA. He been driving for a while when he had decided to get his oil changed again. Unbeknownst to him, his oil light was out and he had been driving without an oil plug in his oil pan. He had no idea when the oil plug had been lost, but he had been driving without any oil for perhaps days, or even weeks. It may have not been installed when his oil was changed. (Although not likely) The oil service garage that noted the missing plug simply replaced it, added the oil, and he was good to go. No apparent engine damage as he drove it away and fixed the oil light. That was a big testimony to me.Each time I have used this product on a car that had not had a previous treatment, I note the gas mileage before and after. It typically improves about 3 miles a gallon after treatment. (I typically drive the higher rpm 4 cylinder economy cars which are already tweaked for the best gas mileage possible.)I understand the concerns about clogging, but the treatment need be done only once every 50K miles or so and it is replaced with fresh oil again on the next oil change. I would suspect the PTFE, not plated out on engine parts, would drain out with the old oil.I have seen the results for myself in engine response and increased gas mileage. Something that is not noticed by simply changing the oil alone. It is also something that can be quickly noted by anyone trying this treatment. I am driving a 2004 Ford Focus with 194000 miles on the original engine. It seems to be running fine. I have used this ~ every 50K miles. I have had other car problems, but not the engine itself.The following link is on a skeptic site that has an executive of the original add agency that addresses a lot of the proofs the company went through to demonstrate the products effectiveness.

64214,2,"This product is so bad I don't see how it could even be approved at all for production. It's a good concept on paper, but in the real world this thing is a tedious piece of crap.First off the reason anyone picks up a autowasher is because they want to cut car washing time down and not have to go through the hassle of grapping a bucket and sponge and cleaning and drying the car off the old fashioned way. It takes hours of your time, and for the average person it is nothing more than a chore.When I saw the autowasher commercial about every 5minutes on Speednetwork I thought maybe I'd give it a try. Maybe this was the car washing miracle that lazy carwashing people like myself have been waiting for. I made it down to autozone and picked one up to try it out.When I first opened it up I saw how cheap it felt. Reminded me of those supersoaker knockoffs they used to carry at the disount stores. These thing is overly huge and clunky. Along with it came cartridges, and a soap packet. As soon a saw this I thought great... I've been thrown into the consumer loop of reapeat acessory purchases. I already knew I would probably spend 19.99 buying soap and cartridges every time I wanted to wash my car. That's a dead give away to any crap product for anyone who can read between the lines.So after 10 minutes or so of trying to figure out this plastic chunk garbage I got the thing loaded and followed the steps as mentioned. Now here I am hoping that this thing was worth all the trouble. I get the car prepped and finally it's time for that MR. Clean Autodry action.! I shoot the soap onto the car...at first I couldn't tell if it was working or not because I barely saw any bubbles. Finally after a few test I saw that it was working properly and the soap was comming out. The soap wasn't very potent at all. I have no idea what it was meant for cleaning but it wasn't my car. After washing my car down with this gunk I then followed the next steps and rinsed it off. Again the rinse factor is very weak. I think my showerhead gives a more powerful wash. Just as directed I rinsed the car off then let it dry. I went inside my house and sat for a half our or so and came back out to check on my new sparkling ride.To my suprise what I really came back out to was a car that looked like it had never been washed at all. Same dirt and grime sitting right on it. Only the windows appeared have been cleaned off somewhat. After spending 2 hours with this piece of trash I was more than pissed. I picked up the gun and saw that the cartridges it came with turned brown somehow. I couldn't figure out how or why. You'd think something be more durable for it's one time use.I stared at the dark blue gun in my hand. The devils on my shoulder yelling at me to smash this thing and stomp on it in my rage. I just wasted 2 hours on a Saturday for nothing...FOR NOTHING! ultimately I ended up returning the thing to the store. For the money invested I should of went to the dollar depot next door and picked up a bucket and a spone. Much better for 90% less than the price of this worthless Mr. Clean product."

Put the sticker that comes with it on your air cleaner housing to let the mechanics know you are wise to their game. Now, instead of telling me I need a new paper filter at 25+ dollars a pop, they offer to clean my K&N for 10 bucks. I just say ""no thank you"" - oh, well, sometimes I laugh."
157417,1,Had a Black & Decker cordless Wrench for over 10 years but the NiMH battery dead. I've been searching for such cordless wrench for years untill now.

After the first set burned out, I e-mailed Sylvania customer service and was sent a new set.Those promptly burned out 6 months later. When the latest pair went, the only reason I purchased them again, was because of the outstanding deal I received from Amazon.

154139,2,"Look, I go through these things. I use them on disk sanders and dual action slash random orbit sanders to finish stainless steel, bronze, aluminum, etc. I have at least 3 disk sanders and 3 DA's as well as larger grinder sander polishers. The 3M yellow disks are pretty tough, but after a while they get nicked on the edges or just disintegrate from heat and stress. My problem is the price. This is an item that should cost no more than about $8-12. It's a small rubber pad with a screw mount. My go-to abrasive and metal working supply outfit sells them for $32 so I guess at $24 I shouldn't complain, but come on. At Harbor Freight you can get a new DA air sander (the whole power tool with a pad like this) for $30! I wish HF would sell knock offs of these but so far not. They would probably cost $6. Instead of these I am now getting the ones sold by Porter Cable which are just as good but closer to $20 here at AMZ."

Anywho, I was less than satisfied. DK"
88263,0,"This item was sent by the returns center of the Amazon. Its packing was broken when I went to the office of my apartment to take it. I think Amazon did not take care of its packing. In addition, it looked like its not in its original box, because the box was torn and they used tape to replace it. I ordered a new item but they send me not. I was very disappointed at Amazon. I will not order the other items from the Amazon if the price is not so big different from the other sellers."

48108,1,"This CAI is great. The installation was simple, except for the trying to get the foam to stay on the top of the box. I was able to cut the foam at the corners and it worked well after that. It took about 15 minutes to put all the parts together and install it. I bought this with the Airaid throttle body spacer and it fits perfectly in the engine compartment of my truck. I noticed about a 1.5 MPG improvement at the pump, and WAY more power. I've also noticed that the engine temperature stays cool. This is in the California desert, with the AC on full blast, so you know it's working well. Other than that it looks awesome, its worth the extra money for the metal CAI."

2748,0,KnN air filters are awesome and this is more of a review of Amazon. They say this fits the I4 2010 G6 but that is not correct. If that is the car you have you want 33-2296. Amazon is wrong. but KnN are awesome filters so go order the correct one.

129869,1,"I got this in the mail and promptly opened up... Checked for the missing ""O Ring"" that previous purchasers mentioned... Mine was there :-) looking back it seems that the problem was on the earlier units... Now likely fixed. I did have to cut the poly tubing that attaches to the pump. It was cut at an angle and you DON'T want to insert it into the fitting unless its cut close to 90 degrees.With that done I tested it on a jug of water... Passed the test with no apparent leaking.Warmed up my car till my engine was at normal operating temperature. Pulled the dip stick and stretched out the smaller poly tubing to equal the length of the dipstick, put a reference mark on it and inserted it into my dipstick tube... Once it reached the mark I gently pushed further till I felt resistance then pulled it back a quarter inch.Pumped it ten times and the oil started coming out through the poly but not into the unit... I added 5 pumps and it started filling the unit. When I felt like it was not filling I would give it another 5 pumps and wait till it stopped. I did this about 5 more times and it started gurgling .. I had extracted all the oil :-) I pumped it about ten times and pushed the poly down the dipstick tube to make sure I was getting all the oil ... When it slowed down I pumped it a couple more times and extracted the tubing. I used a paper towell to wipe off the tube during extraction and it came out without spilling a drop. I had some brake cleaner left over from a job so I squirted some of it into the poly and put my thumb over the end and agitated the poly then pumped it out... Did this a couple times to clean out the poly. I'm a happy camper!"

153021,1,"Unlike other arbor converters this one really works. It comes assembled with a 5/8"" insert, an Allen wrench, and set screws. Remove the insert and the product slips on a 5/8"" arbor with ease and with zero apparent slop. Read my other review of one that does not fit 5/8"" arbors because they milled with no allowance. I highly recommend this product."
98148,2,"This filter wrench is too small to fit a Mobil1 M1-108 filter, which has a 65mmx14 pattern. The filter wrench is 65mm across the points, and just under 64mm across the flats. The filter measures about the same, but the wrench will not fit over the filter. I test fitted an M1-108 filter with a 65mm/67mm wrench at the auto parts store, and it fit into the smaller part of the wrench. I didn't buy that wrench because the 65mm section was very shallow and I wanted a wrench that would fit all the way down onto the filter. Unfortunately, this KD wrench doesn't go over the filter at all."

I keep mine set to IGN, MPG, MAP, AVG. This tool makes it easier to determine when you should shift for optimal mileage. Turns out I was actually shifting too early most of the time. Amazon is the cheapest place to buy one of these, and if you use it properly, it will pay for itself pretty quickly in fuel savings."

155489,0,"I ordered this item because it was the least expensive alternative to lock my 2001 Ford Ranger tailgate. Let me begin by saying that I am not a professional mechanic. However, I consider myself very mechanical. I am 66 and I have repaired things my whole life beginning at about age 10 or 12. So, I feel that I have above average mechanical ability.This item is not an easy bolt in modification for a 2001 Ford Ranger. Perhaps it would be for another year/model of Ranger but not for mine. The first thing I did after accessing the tailgate release mechanism and trying to bolt in the Pop & Lock was to get back on the net and check to see that I had ordered the right model. I did this because the unit would bolt in but it was almost impossible to turn the key the required 90 degrees in both directions to lock and unlock the tailgate latch.I had to grind away about 25% of one of the latch assembly stud heads to provide proper clearance so the key would turn. I then also had to slightly bend the locking lever and reshape (grind) the end of the lever so it would seat properly in the recess in the tailgate latch release handle. All of these adjustments and modifications required that I mount and remove the whole assembly approximately 2 dozen times!All this said, the unit does work smoothly after my mods. However, it is only a deterrent to theft because it can be forced open rather easily.I would not recommend this to anyone who is not mechanically inclined or who is short on patience or imagination."
38578,2,"A pebble hit my beamer, made a speckle and it radiated with minute cracks. It was too expensive to get it fixed and replaced and my insurance didn't cover it.

I have owned mine for well over 5 years and it still performs flawlessly. If you are a do it yourself or professional technician, this is the best jump box on the market to have in your tool set. Like anything, if it is well cared for, no reason you should not get 10 years out of it. By the way, don't sweat the issue with the extension cord for charging. When my microwave died, I cut the cord off the back, went to the hardware store and bought a repair end and attached it. That is how I charge the unit. Use your imagination here folks."

76182,0,"First of all, I'd like to say how pleasurable it is to shop online here at Amazon.com. The whole buying and shipping process is always a breeze and I hardly shop anywhere else online now. Highly recommended.This review is for both of these related products:CIPA 48000 Ford OE Style Manual Replacement Driver Side MirrorCIPA 48100 Ford OE Style Manual Replacement Passenger Side MirrorI have a 1991 Ford F150 XLT and after nearly 20 years of exposure, it needed new mirrors. I thought about trying to restore the old ones, removing the rust, etc., but decided to get new ones instead and these CIPA ones seemed reasonably priced. They do look good and fit the existing mounting points on the doors perfectly. The brackets are a little different than the factory ones, but still work OK. They even come with hardware to mount them if your truck had a different factory mirror setup, though you would have to drill holes in the door in this case.The bad news is that both mirrors distort the view ever so slightly, but just enough to be annoying. Backing up is especially troublesome as depth of vision is off. A couple of times I almost backed into my garage when I thought I was still 3 feet away and was actually less than a foot away. Bottom line, they are nowhere near the quality of the factory originals. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I did hope for better.I'm still using the mirrors for now, but have decided to go ahead and restore the originals ... a little naval jelly, steel wool, flat black paint, new mounting bolts and they're looking a lot better. My advice is to pass on these and spring for the Ford ones or shop around a salvage yard if yours are wrecked."
3282,0,"I've had one of these for four or five years. It's very effective on thick, tough ice. It will penetrate smooth ice which other scrapers hardly scratch. After severe use, the edges haven't nicked. But as others have noted, it isn't very sharp and it doesn't conform to curved glass, so it doesn't do well with thin layers of frost. Suggestion: keep one of these in your closet to pull out when there's an ice storm, but don't rely on it as your only scraper. (And do keep in in your closet, not your trunk, because it's most valuable after ice storms which make car trunks and doors inoperable.)"

90835,1,"Replacing a worn shift knob in a Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart, I looked at quite a few different ones. Finally decided on this Razo and am glad I did. This shift knob has a much better weight and feel than stock. Installation was easy with the included adapters. I now have better, more solid shifting using the Razo. Only thing that I didn't like was no shift pattern on the knob itself, but on stickers that could be placed on the console."

22779,1,"..........what more can I say....theiran exact fit for anyone who has a 1998 on up Ford Crown Victoria! I heard online that these are a little bit louder than the stock catalytic converters......truthfully I really don't hear a difference. If you want the sound get some different mufflers, bigger pipes or something else.......but buying these and having someone put them on my 2000 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor was A LOT CHEAPER than Ford trying to charge me over $900 for ONE SIDE......and EVEN MORE for the drivers side! Don't get these thinking they are ""High Flow"" either......they are direct fit OEM style.....meaning they are made to replace what came with your vehicle from the factory and perform if not better....than equivalent to them! Maybe they flow better than the stock catalytic converters but they are not....and I repeat......they ARE NOT ""High Flow!"" I HIGHLY recommend these for anyone who has a Crown Victoria and need replacement catalytic converters (unless you live in California)!"
114757,1,"Very sturdy well-built bag.. feels like it will last a lifetime. It's very easy to strap down to your hitch basket.

167439,1,"This shocks are a good replacement to oem shocks for a 2000 Cadillac Seville SLS. Albeit, they are not as cushy as stock shocks but for about $64 a pair, it's very hard to beat. Oem shocks are anywhere from 400-1000 each one...that's right, up to 2000.00 for a pair of oem shocks. Of course, prices vary depending upon where you purchase them.Back to the Max-Airs. They hook-up the same as the oem. Fit snug and secure. They are also just as big. You will notice the shocks have a large diameter. The shocks are also black, not white as advertised...sure makes it easier to hide the fact they are not oem. These shocks DO NOT come with the electronic adjustable sensor...hence the price. Still, the provide a solid ride with a reasonable amount of cushion. I quickly noticed that they don't provide a cloud-like feel, but for $64 they're are a great alternative. The shocks do air up and help offset weight in the rear. They handle pretty well over bumps and provide a smooth ride for the most part. You will be able to tell a differece with these shocks in comparison to oem, but again you are saving a ton of money.As for quality, they are monroe...a good brand with solid contstruction. Plus, I think the ones I got offered a life-time warranty. Only time will tell how long they last. Still, have carried light loads and heavy loads the rubber boot inflats perfectly and deflates perfectly.Definitely worth it if you like your car, don't want to part with it, and don't have at least $800 to buy a set of oems.O yeah, almost forgot, installation was pretty easy. Basic tools are needed and it's definitely a one-man, under the tree, driveway type install."
102423,2,"I don't mind that it doesn't look exactly like the advertised pic.It does fit into the socket of the car I chose before buying this product.That's a plus.The minus: it can't be called ""pop out"" because it would not stay in.I tried it on the car, I had to push it in and held it there for a whileto light my cigarette.My decision: I will keep this and get used to it.It's now called ""56442-push-and-hold-cigarette-lighter"".I don't want to return because they might ask me to buy a new carto use this product the way it's supposed to be used. :-)"

144584,0,"So the unit is exactly as pictured...it is made of quality materials, brass, chromed steel and a good quality rubber hose.The inflator chuck rotates, a nice feature.My only complaint and it is a big one is that the pressure gauge is very small and very hard to read. With only 2psi increments that are difficult to discern.I tested accuracy against several other gauges I own and it it came up consistently 1-2 psi off, but worse that that...it is HARD TO READNow I need my reading glasses AND a flashlight to read the pressure accurately.It is a very small window to read the pressure (even with built in magnifying glass) and is just frustrating compared to the stick type guage.I recommend as an inflator...but as a gauge no...keep another gauge handy if you want to be accurate."

The thing sits so low off the ground that I need a draw bar with about 6"" of rise to pull even a light trailer at a somewhat level stance. The product itself, like all other curt products I've purchased was excellent quality. I rate it low like this because I think that they should have refrained from manufacturing a hitch receiver that would sit so low, or that they should at least have put a disclaimer in the notes for my vehicle application to that effect."

127916,1,"I almost bought a different more expensive one because of the negative reviews but I am so glad I didn't. This is just a great tire gauge. I had a low tire pressure signal come up on my dash. I couldn't tell using the gas station gauge which was low. I know I had a tire that tends to leak and had my husband check it out. He complained our analog gauge that had the round needle display though better than the cheap ones shaped like a penlight, was still a pain to use. He said it was hard to use our old one when the tire valve was at a certain spot and he had to move the tire a bit to use it.So I bought this one - my first digital and I can't believe the difference in ease of use. (I also can't believe the price. I think I bought our analog gauge one from Sears for $25 back in the day.) This one automatically comes on when you use it. Display shows clearly and reads easily. It's quick. It doesn't leak air when you're trying to fit it in. Great size for the glove compartment. Battery is included. I haven't had trouble with getting a reading no matter what angle the tire valve ends up pointing.I used to always have my husband deal with our slowly leaking tire. Now do it myself because it's not a hassle. It's nice to be able to check the tires quickly and know which need pumping before even driving it to get air at the gas station.Specifications (according to the package):Range: 5-150 PSIOperating Temperature: 0-100 deg F (-18 to 33 deg C)Accuracy: +/- 1% + 0.5Power: Replaceable Lithium LR44 1.5VCoin Cell (3)"

99660,1,"This product is truley genius. 750 watts of RMS power at demand. Instant switching at selectable voltage drops. The Tripplite APS 750 is set to run off of my 825amp marine battery when it detects a voltage drop below 95 volts. When this occurs It switches from AC pass through power to a 20 second minimum run off of the battery.If after 20 seconds the line power is still below the adustable threshold trigger, the unit will continue to run off of the DC battery. When the line power is back and stable, the unit resumes AC in-out pass through ""while also charging the marine battery at a 20amp rate"" to have it fully recharged for the next AC outtage.If you're experiencing a bad lightning storm and power is flickering, or you are going through brown-out conditions, this device will switch over the instant the voltage drop is detected and will run off of the battery power for a minimum of 20seconds. ( So there is NO rapid switching of source power.)I use the Tripplite APS 750 to run the main life support pumps on my saltwater tank. "" Four punps at a total of 120 watts."" My pumps were geting damaged from the rapid switching of AC power causing one of them to malfunction and hence me having to come home to saltwater on the floor.(Not a problem anymore!) The Tripplite APS 750 says what it does and does what it says. It may only switch to battery power for 20 seconds once in a year, but I know my floors are dry now and the critical systems on the tank are 24/7/365.By the way, at 120 watts of draw the 825amp marine battery would last over eight hours before it exhausted its usable amp load. If you need more battery run time you can cascade muliple batteries. The Tripplite has no problem with multiple DC sources. Just follw thier insructions.AN OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!"
22703,0,"I have a 2005 GMC Envoy whose fan was blowing a lot of resistor packs, or so I suspected. I changed the fan with this fan - it took only about 15-20 minutes - and everything works fine now. No resistor packs have been blown since.However, the fan now has a slight high-pitched sound that the original OEM fan did not have. It's not very loud but you can definitely notice it. I don't know if that's a big complaint but it's something potential buyers should know."

I might buy it again because trashstands are hard to find as reasonably priced as this one. It is inconvenient to use but it looks better than liter or a bag on the floor of my car. All things considered, it is worth the money."

All the brackets are the exactly the same as the OEM bars (black) I'm replacing. Waiting to here back from Westin before install, seems like it should be pretty straight forward. If Westin doesn't send caps I can see these things rusting out quick. - Still waiting to hear back from Westin, it's only been 3 days, 2 were over the weekend.

The polishing compund does not work to completely re-shine the area and the final result is not good. Gets rid of the scratch though."
105552,2,I would give this company a negative rating if i could. I ordered the part next day delivery and didnt recive it for a week and a half.

Surprisingly, I've tested this against my ""bench"" Fluke 115 and, while it's more temperature-sensitive than the Fluke (and won't do true RMS measurements, which aren't all that important away from my shop), it's quite accurate at temperatures from 50F to 100F, and really very noticeable (might have something to do with the bright green case); I suspect I'll be less likely to lose it at an ""incident"" than the Fluke 113's I've used in the past.

83106,2,"I bought this product because my car locks have a tendency to freeze in the wintertime, whenever there is a thaw and then a freeze soon afterward; my only alternative is leaving my car door unlocked. I got this product, and one morning when my locks were frozen, I tried it out. You put the narrow nozzle a little ways into the keyhole and it shoots fluid directly into the lock mechanism. Nifty, except that after applying, trying the lock, applying again, trying the lock, waiting, trying the lock, trying my other car door.... it still didn't work. Was still late to work and still had to leave my car unlocked. The second time I tried it, the same thing happened, only after 15 minutes or so one of the locks did finally pop open. So, it did work eventually, once, but I don't feel confident that I could get it to work again. So I'm still leaving my car unlocked. It could be that my car is older and that this would make my locks in particular harder to unfreeze, but if so, then they need to say so on the product information, because when I buy something that's supposed to de-ice car locks, I expect it to do its job. I gave it 2 stars because it did work once, and having it work once is, I suppose, better than not having it work at all; however, as I said, I do not rely on it to work again, so if I absolutely have to get into my car, I still don't lock my door."
69859,0,"This is a good cushion, and is adecuate as a flotation device. What I don't like about the cushion is that instead of it being one solid piece of foam, like the ones we used as kids, it is three or four layers of foam that shift from side to side within the cover. It works fine, but isn't as solid as the ones made from one piece of foam material. I don't think it will hold up as well, but time will tell. Having said that, I think it was a good purchase and would recommend it to those who aren't on the water every week."

I ended up shoving the bottom straps through the back of the seat and hooking them to whatever they would reach. The front straps I had to unhook completely."

185663,0,"I bought this 4 months ago to replace a Campbell Hausfeld air compressor with almost 20 years of service. My old compressor used 12V DC current only (cigarette lighter)and this one has a built in battery. The battery is of little use to me because it won't hold a decent charge; it never really has despite charging according to directions. I charged it overnight for use this morning. The charge inflated the tire from 19 psi to 23 psi before going dead.....4 measly pounds on a ""fully"" charged battery. The tire size is 235 65 17, so not a small tire by any means, but 4 pounds?? I used the cigarette lighter cord to finish the inflation to 32 psi.Sturdy construction, adequate length hose to reach valve stems at their highest point, fairly quick inflation compared to my old compressor. Storage area for cords WAY too small, expect to do some serious stuffing to fit these back into the storage space once they're unraveled....or you may even give up after a few minutes.This is perfect for bicycle tires using only the internal battery. But, expect to use the cigarette lighter cord if you plan on inflating auto tires.It's just frustrating when you expect a product to perform as you thought was advertised. Except for the small storage space, I would have absolutely no complaints on this product if it DIDN'T have the internal battery to begin with. But since it does, it should at least hold a charge enough to inflate a set of tires that are each a few pounds low. Ok, even 2 tires each a few pounds low would be borderline acceptable....but a single tire 4 pounds on a ""fully"" charged battery....not acceptable."

17123,2,Only one hole on this item that does not line up on my hitch. If the hole in your hitch assembly is shorter or longer (farther or closer back from the end) than the hole on the step's rod this will not fit correctly. You can either return it or drill a new hole as I did. Use a new drill bit if you make your own hole because the metal is very strong. It will take a while to penetrate both sides. The description of this item should be more detailed as to the location of the hole for the securing pin so that you can be sure it will fit your hitch. There are plenty of other steps out there. I would not recommend this one unless you are sure it will fit your hitch.

75962,0,"I bought my Swisher bucket from Tractor Supply over two years ago and I went through a whole series of RE-Engineering before I had this bucket working like it should. I have a 1998 Honda TRX450 which has CONSTANT 4 wheel drive. You can not turn it off and that was exactly what I wanted for dredging out my lake bottom in the mud. I did add some killer mud tires and a 80 pound bag of concrete on the back rack for traction. The mounting kit for the a arms was useless and had to be totally redone. Almost ALL of the places that moved during normal ups and downs were worn out and so I re-did those with some welding and added some OIL HOLES for lubrication.I bought a Warn 2500 winch but a more powerful one would be better. I highly recommend that you REMOVE the 50 foot winch cable and cut it into 5 foot lengths. This helps a lot with your cable slack/binding problems plus the winch has more torque when it is short on the spool. Of course your winch is not much use for pulling you out of a tight spot anymore. My next winch will have a web belt, NOT a cable and Warn now makes one.I also added a heavier strip of metal all around the front lip which stiffens it up a lot. My bucket had a small weld every 6 inchs and did not hold up very long. I sent pictures and comments to Swisher about all the problems but got very little response.Another major problem was the battery not lasting long due to the use of the electric winch and my electric shift tranny so I added a solar panel under the front rack and never had any more problems.If I had to do it all over again I would build it myself and maybe get it right the FIRST TIME!I plan to sell this entire setup, ATV & bucket in the next few weeks and go with a UTV. Grandpa Dale, Retired on Lake Buchanan Texas"
153100,2,I bought this for my son since I have owned a similar Pan for many years that is pretty tough. This item is much cheaper in material (TOO THIN) and Plug seals don't work well. I had to sand down the rough edges of the center pan PLUG: It came with very uneven edge that would never seal. I also found that the single thread doesn't hold very well and will let the plug POP OUT if you tighten it much. The whole Pan is made of very thin and flexible (not firm) plastic. This is made to hold HOT OIL? My old Pan is strong with thick plastic and good sealing around the Plugs. This one is a poor immitation of a better product that I have not been able to find anymore. It is now usable after some modifications (like adding an O-Ring seal to the center plug but still very flimsy so has to be used with care! It is NOT AS ADVERTISED. It has been cheapened too much and could be dangerous if the user is not very careful when using it.
118288,1,"This gauge is quality throughout, but has an unfortunate feature. The release button is designed to bleed off over- pressure instead of holding the read pressure. This means you must hold the hose fitting tightly to the tire valve with one hand, hold the gauge dial with the other, then try to work a finger onto the bleed button. This is very awkward. The Accu-Gauge (lesser quality) gauge this one is replacing simply holds the reading for you to see. You can bleed off excess pressure at the tire valve.Also the protective rubber cover (not included!!) can only be installed by removing the hose assembly from the dial body. After installed, there is only a very narrow surface available for a wrench on the dial stem to re-attach the hose assembly. I would think twice before buying one of these.Update: I have rotated the release button to one side (with difficulty) so that it can be easily reached with a finger. The gauge now is a pleasure to use. If the unit came with the cover installed and the bleed button positioned correctly (as pictured) it would get five stars."

161627,0,"I ordered this Hayden Automotive product because I was under the assumption that it was made in the US. My local auto parts store only carried Dayco products and I read some online reviews about how Dayco's Chinese-made bearings were inferior. Imagine my surprise when I opened the Hayden box and saw a Dayco pulley with ""Made in China"" stamped on the side. It's steel not plastic, so that's a plus, but we'll see how the bearings hold up. The price on Amazon with shipping was cheaper than my local store, so I guess I still saved some money (as long as this part holds out). Lesson learned: Hayden Automotive, Four Seasons, & Dayco all use the same Chinese parts."

Plainly stated, it works well - keeps frost and ice off of the windshield of the car my daughter uses to go to college - and most importantly, it keeps ME from getting up extra early to scrape frost/ice off of her windshield!It does seem a bit flimsy but it has held up for several weeks now. My suggestion is that if you feel like it's too windy out to trust the elastic bands, use your windshield wipers to help hold it down.It's also true that it's not full size - it doesn't completely cover the windshield, but it does cover over 80% and if you set it on there right, you probably won't have to scrape at all. it's a great value for the money - buy an extra one for the first one wears out."

35449,2,"So far my button is still attached (only 2 days later, will update when/if it separates) and survived the reinstallation of the rear view mirror. I have an '06 jetta and the rear view mirror twists onto the button by means of a bracket inside the mirror which is different from many other buttons that accept a mirror that slides into place. Since you have to rotate the bracket onto the button it puts a significant amount of stress on the bond.Reflecting on it now, I did a terrible job the first time I tried this product and thats why I tried it a second time. (16$ compared to the 85$ the glass shop people wanted, but we'll see how long it lasts)First time I used the kit I followed the directions perhaps too explicitly in some places and not enough in others. First off, if you're using this product anytime other than the winter, I recommend doing so at night when it is coolest because heat really messes up the curing. The first time I did it I let it cure for an hour at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when it was like 97 degrees outside. When I tried to install the mirror an hour later (directions say at least 30 minute cure time) the button popped right off and the adhesive was still liquid. The directions say don't try and apply the adhesive if its hotter than 75 degrees and I think thats a strict rule.The instructions say to use only a drop of the adhesive. So for the first time I tried installing it I used a single drop of the adhesive as described, held it to the glass for 2 minutes and then let it cure for the hour. The adhesive wasn't nearly enough but again it was seriously 97 degrees, it was a terrible idea.The first time I used the kit I didn't sand my button enough. The button for my car is black metal as is the underside of the button as well. What I didn't realize is that the black underpart of the button was actually the adhesive that the manufacturer used as opposed to the glue like substance that had been used by the auto detailing place (simoniz, not like a body shop) when they broke it off while doing the interior. So I sanded the button way down until the bottom of the button was shiny silver.So the second time I did it, I started at midnight when it was as cool as it was going to get. I also used 2 generous (borderline 3) drops of the adhesive on my button. This will probably come back to bite me in the @$$ if I ever have to get it removed. Again, I pushed the button to the window for 2 minutes and this time let the button cure overnight. I awoke the next morning and tested it. At first I thought the button had popped because I had messed up when I was trying to install the mirror but surprisingly it was the bracket that popped (didn't break) leaving the button on there. In the end I had to remove the arm from the mirror, and get that onto the button, then push the actual mirror really hard onto the ball for the ball socket. All in all if it was going to break I imagine it would have broken when I was foolishly trying to get the mirror back on, though it didn't.I give it 4 out of 5 for these reasons because I think the single drop of adhesive isn't enough and because I haven't tested this product for an extended period of time.I'll update this post again when/if the button comes off again.08/25/12Button fell off today while I was adjusting the the mirror. Perhaps I've been messing around with it too much but I was confident it would hold. Thinking about trying this product again and using the whole adhesive tube but we'll see."
143554,1,"I love Amazon's Parts Finder. It made it simple to find these bulbs for my pickup truck.Since I only had one bulb out, I only replaced that one bulb. This gave me a chance to see how this bulb compares to the OEM. I expected something really impressive, but they're both the same. I guess that's OK, but I'm still a little disappointed. I really wanted the right side of the road to look dazzling compared to the left side. Oh well.The light fit perfectly and works fine. The replacement was simple enough. If you have any troubles, there are plenty of Youtube videos that show how to remove the old bulb.So this replacement bulb is fine. It's not awesome in any way, but it put me back on the road."
133209,1,"Nothing special about this product, but its a great replacement for the original part. No fuss no muss. Good stuff."
67530,2,i tried these as a replacement for my stock struts on my mustang. everyone i knew said they were awesome.. waist of money. lasted maybe 9k-10k then my car was riding like a boat. you get what you pay for. go with the kyb
89221,1,"For my application the plugs seated about a 1/32&#34; from being flush. They are aircaft hardware quality. Beware, it is not noted, but they come 2 per box, P/N 662030, not just one plug."
30174,1,Definitely noticed an increase in power... great product and I would definitely recommend to Honda riders... shadow sabre. Get the recharge kit!
129935,1,"The mityvac really makes it easier to change your oil. Less mess, no crawling under the car, and easy disposal.The only issue I had was the first time I pumped oil out of the mityvac into a container. The rubber connector between the large and small hose cannot take the pressure when pumping oil from the unit. I had a little blowout. Simple solution though, just disconnect the small hose from the large when pumping. I would highly recommend the mityvac 7201."
121161,0,"After walking my dog, she often needs a drink. It's hard to keep a water bottle in my Jeep Wrangler JK without it rolling around. Therefore, I decided to get this item. Since it is described as a Roll Bar Drink Holder I was surprised to find that there were two items in the box. So, I now have one drink holder for each downtube of the Jeep's roll cage. They hold an aluminum bottle or the smaller standard plastic water bottles well. Since the holder is deep enough, the bottles will not fall out. Installation is very easy with the velcro straps. When the water bottle is full and you're driving on a rough road, the drink holder sways and creaks a bit. Although this is a great solution for keeping (small) water bottles in the Jeep, I do not think the product is extremely durable."
49870,1,"I owned the same one before so I knew what I was getting. It is strong and comfortable but my previous one snagged on my belt buckle which spoiled it but still lasted long as I put it on an older truck instead. Protects well, doesn't rub or leave any residue."
68962,1,"I've used the K&N; products in my vehicles for years and decided on using it in the motorcycle as a replacement to the stock Yamaha air filter. Being in Southern California, it seemed to get dirty pretty quickly and it just makes sense to replace it with a cleanable filter like I use in my truck.The fitment is perfect and required just a few minutes to install. A great product that I would definitely recommend."
64079,0,"It arrived unwrapped, no box, just the shipping label, and chipped paint. There were rusted areas on it. I requested a 2nd one and same thing, now been 4 weeks and Amazon has not I still have the 2nd one, and no credit back yet. My conclusion is this item is used and should NOT be priced as new. The description should clearly state it is used.ZERO star if I can give that!"
53438,1,"I have owned one of the Hopkins larger products that has two cup holders that operate similarly to this one and the little console storage space. I liked it a lot and I remember seeing this single cup holder at the auto parts store when I bought the console thing. When I got this Ford Escape I have now, the console thing would not work but I remembered the single cup holder and went hunting for it. I was happy to find ont. I agree with other reviewers that the initial adjustment was a little odd, but once done, the produce is great, I love it. None of my coffee cups or soda cups will fit in a standard cup holder so this product is just what I needed. The only drawback may be that the cup holders that are built in to the car are in line with the shifter so the Hopkins Retro Cupholder has to go in the rear cup holder and basically covers up the front one that is just behind the shifter. Not that I would use it as I don't have any cups or anything that size; I just slide all my extra change in there and every once in a while, take the holder out, collect the change and I have quite a bit of money saved. Anyway, if they ever quit making this product, I'm going to be in a world of hurt, trying to figure out how to keep my cups in place."
121195,1,"The kit is made of quality materials. The installation was fairly easy.I wish it would have come with heavier duty tie-wraps and a method for mounting the quick connect to the vehicle other than a bolt/screw. Other than that, I have no complaints."
135408,0,The visors seem to be good quality but on my Honda Pilot (95) the passenger visor stops the window from closing completely. I have tried adjusting this several times but to no avail. The drivers side is fine. The rear visors use tape and one cracked the first time the windows was closed.

91946,1,"These wiper blades are good and a great value for money. This fits the passenger side of Honda CRV 2008. I brought the driver's side wiper also, but anco wipers don't fit the driver side of a CRV and I had to request a refund. So be careful. Overall I am pleased with this wiper. It wipes silently."
136351,0,I feel overall that its a decent product ... a little disgusted w/ the PLASTIC washers breaking??!!?Will most likely look for some METAL replacements!!!
159630,1,"These wipers do a great job, a little squeaky/streaky right now but probably will improve after a little more use. Instructions weren't the greatest, but since most all wipers are slightly different it just takes a few minutes looking it over to figure it out."
104457,1,"Great back-up alarm. I put mine on a switch so that I'm not annoying my neighbors when I'm not in an area that requires the use of the alarm, but when it is on, it is nice and loud. This is a light-weight easy-to-install warning alarm that has stood up to the elements well so far. I have it mounted under the rear bumper of my truck and it has seen rain, ice and snow with no complaints. Want to sound like a UPS truck (or otherwise just ensure that people are aware that you are backing up)? This alarm won't disappoint."

36704,0,"It's clearly better than the $3 shiny ones and does block out light...but seemingly does not block out UV well. Of course, without measuring, I cannot be certain. I just haven't noticed a heat reduction compared to my previous $15 one. Also, if you're not careful how you grab this with your fingers, you'll find yourself scrunching, crackling, crimping, whatever...the shade."
17662,0,"After 2 yrs, the rubber seals have cracked even though my Jeep has not been left out in the harsh elements. During a long road trip, one lock became loose so be sure to travel with the right sized hex key. Dry lock has prevented this from happening since that episode. Also, after having your Jeep serviced, be certain to check the hood locks making sure they are truly locked as one side of my hood was whipped up by the drive-by wind of a semi trailer truck. That was frightening! It is not obvious that my hood is slightly warped until I open the hood and attempt to re-lock it. These locks are not theft-proof, but at least they would slow down someone trying to gain entry to the motor. I would buy these locks again but I am disappointed that I can not find replacement parts for the cracked rubber seals that protect the painted surface of my Jeep."
169573,1,"My project was to replace the rear carpeting in my '69 Corvette coupe. The front carpets were replaced about 5 years ago at which time I used another thermal barrier product which was state of the art. I can't remember the name of the product but it consisted of a metallic layer bonded to to a plastic air cell layer. This product work quite well as a heat barrier but was not all that good as a sound barrier. After purcahsing the new rear carpet set I discovered Dyanamat through friends and after talking to professional car restorer. I am very pleased with Dynamat as both a sound and heat barrier. The install in a Corvette was a bit of work as the Dynamat must be cut in to complex shapes to cover the odd contours in the car. So even though the interior of a Corvette is small the amount of Dyanmat that is required is the same as a larger vehicle. After cutting the complex shapes there is a larger amount of wastage unless you want to cut it up smaller and ""puzzle"" it together. Bear in mind that the ""trunk"" of Corvette is actually part of the interior. Over all installing Dyanmat into this type of vehicle is well worthwhile even thought it is not considered a stock restoration. The results and the benefits are far superior in terms of performance. AS for the cost, it is a not a factor as the cost of the stock sound barrier from a restoration source is the same as the DYnamat."
101759,0,Works as described. However a bit disappointed for the following reasons.1) although after reasonable amount of charging the light is not so bright in the night.2) There is a small hole that's used to put out the cigaretts. When I drive it's hard to put out the cigaretts with it. I had a different kind of ash tray with better design in this regard.3) The capacity could be bigger.
37192,0,"I received this product assuming it would smell like leather; however, it smells more like a men's cologne. I gave it 3 stars because the scent is long lasting."
159039,2,This clock worked for about two days then quit. I could never get it to keep the proper time.I was really disappointed. I would not recommend this product.
118967,1,First item did not work properly. Satisfactory replacement received very quickly. This is a prime vendor to deal with.
546,1,"For the price it definitely is better than a rusted, hole filled, bad performing stock exhaust. Very easy to install/disassemble old exhaust. I wish I bought the 02 sensor, cat., and front pipe/headers and did it all at once. It still will be easy to do in the future. My old exhaust farted, leaked and did not let my 99 jeep cherokee run to its fullest. Immediately I had a difference with everything. Came with everything you need. Very satisfied and will recommend to others. It is not loud, sounds stock with a little extra tone."
170926,0,"I purchased 2 of these, there not cross-drilled. The fact is your still getting Brembo rotors for $20 a piece new."
994,1,The product description was accurate. Everything I hoped it would be. Install was easy and it fit like a glove. I can definitely feel a increase in performance. There's no going wrong with this air filter.
173182,1,"Installed this on my HHR in a little over an hour. Best to get the car up on two ramps to make access easy. You only have to enlarge the rear hole on the passenger side to accept the 1/2"" bolts. All other 3 holes are the correct size."
119494,2,"This is one of the worst products I have ever seen!!!! After a lot of mixing I Got the color right but when it dried it was a darker color. The texture looked like a glob of paint on the seat. Tried to remove the mess and ruined the seat. The texture sheets are a joke. The ""repair"" looked much worse then before I started. Duck tape would have been a better fix. Don't waste your money."
30448,0,"I was a bit disapointed in the brackets supplied with this product and the fact that there are no groves or pockets in the rubber gaskets to retain the grease. The product installed okay on my RV and have held up for a 3000 mile trip to Colorado but I am concerned they will not hold up long term. These were one of the very few options I was able to find that fit my 1.375"" sway bar. The standard for most vehicles is 1"" or less. I guess the larger bar was installed because of the extra weight on the RV.Performance wise, the product seems to work well. I hit heavy winds in NM for hours on end and the RV stayed on the road well."
39633,0,"I purchased this as I was installing new roof vents in my trailer. There really isn't much to say about it other than the screws are not self tapping. This may or may not be a problem for you. For me, it was a problem, my new vents had a different hole pattern for the screws and my trailer has a steel structure. Needless to say I needed self tapping screws as I wasn't about to pre drill then use the supplied screws. I don't know if the other reviewer actually got self tapping screws, but my two kits I purchased did not have them. I purchased it around July 2012.By the way, you don't need caulk along with this putty tape, the tape seals the joints, that is the main use for it, not sure why you'd need to caulk the joint as well."
158069,1,"Need a worklight? An underchassis light, something to hang off the side of your lightbar? This is the deal. You could swing a baseball bat at this thing, maybe you have to push the lens back in, but I defy you to break this sucker.

8438,0,"Works very well, but WILL move around the garage floor, either little by little with normal use, or alot if kicked/walked on by family members, pets etc. The fix is easy: $5 at Lowes will get you a special kit that will anchor the mats securly to the floor. Problem solved!"
182042,1,"Swapped this into a 89 Toyota Land Cruiser and they fit with a bit of adjustment to the dust cover, but they were great with a lot of grip."

42631,0,"Replaced rusted out rear section of Jeep Liberty Renegade exhaust with JBA 304 stainless. Price was good...fit, not so good. The rear section won't fit around back axle with gas tank skid plate in place. We had to section the exhaust to make it fit (not ideal). This is a flow through type system, so expect more noise than a conventional counter flow type muffler. Rear plastic bumper valence opening had to be modified (dremel) to fit exhaust tip."
131407,0,"These chaps are very inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. They look okay as long as you do not get closer than a few feet. With the exception of the bottom ten inches, these chaps are not leather, they are made from ""bonded leather"" which is synthetic with ground up leather particles added to it for the smell. You can easily tell that the ""patchwork"" pattern is fake. I do not know what possessed some of the reviewers to say that the leather is thick, or supple, it is not even close to any of that. The workmanship is as cheap as they come, these will definitely not hold up in a crash. The buckle is indeed the worst offender. If you only buy these for looks and some wind protection like I did, you should be fine, but if you want serious protection from the elements or a road slide, look elsewhere."
156054,1,The ball seemed good. I didn't use it because I ordered it along with a hitch. Sadly the hitch didn't fit my car and I chose to not install a hitch at all on the car. Overall the ball seemed good.

44405,1,"works like it should.there are probably cheaper ones out there, but this is well built and does exactly what it says.it's no fluke, but works just as well.The battery check function is handy (but they dont document how it works, so i dont really trust it yet)"
91567,0,"I have a set of these on my Sportster.The chrome is peeling, especially on the ""throttle boss"". What I really don't like is the diameter of grips, which is personal preference I guess but something to think about. The only other physical complaint is the plastic where the throttle cable goes doesn't seem particularly tough and got chewed up quite a bit for the install and when I replaced the buttons on my sporty.I have other Kuryakyn products I like (foot pegs, rests, bags) just not a fan of these."
132081,0,"I ordered this because it was listed as 27 1/2 inches long...the actual dimensions are 15"" long x 6 1/2"" tall x 8"" wide. Now I have to decide if it will work....much smaller than listed,it may have to be returned. I like it except for the size, very disappointed in that."

124361,0,"It's just barely OK for the price, had some difficulty in installing the hinges. It's slick as ice when wet, don't try to walk on it! I'm going to have to spray coat it with grit before there's a nasty accident. The bottom lip is high enough that when trying to drive onto the ramp it pushes the ramp forward into the truck (you have to install the truck bed end against an edge to prevent this) and my snow blowers 14"" wheels won't go up the ramp, they sit and spin on the bottome edge of the ramp, I have to get a running start to get it on the ramp."

Using the Gilmour 75QGFMR Foamaster and just hose pressure makes foam well enough but it's still a bit wet and runs off the car quickly.I still found it a superior method to washing with a sudsy bucket though, especially in winter. Less time spent dipping in the bucket and more washing the car.- D"
92647,0,"I bought this generator at Atwoods Farm supply store on June 1, 2007, I paid $177.00 on sale,(regularly $239.00) for it new. I had trouble getting it started initially. But once it was running it worked ok until I tried to run a 6 amp 4 inch handheld metal grinder, it would shut down under the starting load. I question it's ability to run a large icebox or other items that take a big initial surge load. It ran electric lights and things that you might need for camping just fine. From the name sportsman on it, I would hardly think it's meant for a worksite, but at a campsite it seems at home. I like the size of the generator (it fits in the trunk of my car) and the seperate battery charging feature. According to the schematic included in the owners manual the generator has a seperate 12volt winding that is not part of the 120 volt winding, that is good if you have a battery to charge and run 12 volt items from it. The 12 volt part doesn't tax the 120 volt part.The generator did surprise me in one respect, it is much quieter than I expected it to be, it has a larger muffler than I've seen on other generators of it's size. The generator came with a tool kit that has a spark plug wrench and screwdriver tip and handle for it in a little grey plastic tool pouch. The spark plug wrench is useless unless you remove the gas tank. The wrench is too long to reach under the tank and fit down over the spark plug to remove it, I used a shorter spark plug socket and a short breaker bar to reach up under the tank, then loosen the plug and remove it by hand. I had to do this because the engine turned out wasn't getting fuel, I wanted to see if combustion had occured and to check to see if wet fuel was on the plug, the plug was clean and gapped according to specifications in the owners manual. Even though I followed the starting procedure in the owners manual with the choke and all, it would not start, I checked the plug and it had fire/spark. I ended up pouring some fuel into the carb directly the first time (only once) and then after the generator started repeatedly without many pulls. I think this generator needs a primer bulb like is on some 2 cycle and 4 cycle lawnmowers, that would help initial starting. According to the owners manual, the fuel petcock has a fuel filter, but mine ( I have the model GEN154 in Green paint) doesn't have the fuel petcock like the picture in the manual. I see no place for a filter there. I do like the screen/filter that is in the filler opening on the gas tank. It is removeable/cleanable and it does a good job catching particles that might be in the gasoline. I like the air filter design, I think it would be easy to get replacement foam filters.In the manual it says that you don't want to pull the rope all the way out on starting it. From my experience with this generator I think what they mean is that you don't have to pull on this engine very hard or all the way to make it start, I found this generator to be more apt to start if you don't pull on the pull rope with such great force, if you pull it easy it tends to start alot easier.I think this is good since some people like the elderly or a woman could start this generator without having to have much strength. I think running the generator on a lightweight break-in with light loads for the first 20 hours or so would help, it just seemed that the more I ran it, the easier it got for me to start and use.I think running it in a break-in mode is a good idea. I agree with some reviews that said the part covering the starter rope is plastic, it is, but I think that it breaking may have been a result of an over zealous owner pulling the rope like it was a 15 horse B&S; engine. I saw no problem with the part as long as you pull it easy. Yes, I did have one bolt that holds the generator end off the frame with a spring that made a little noise initially, I tightened it to match the opposite one and it quit rattling. I think they need to pay more attention to QC at the factory. All in all, if the generator continues to work as it has, I think it was well worth the $177.00 I paid for it(I wouldn't pay over $200.00 for it), and if you are going to use it for camping or lightweight power needs. If you want something to run your house, icebox or air conditioner in a power outage, get something bigger. If you've got $500 to spend, get a coleman powermate at about 4 or 5 kw capacity. They are well made and easy enough to start."

72866,1,I looked everywhere on and offline for a dash cover or mat or carpet for my Moms car. Dash mat is a product I have used and purchased in the past. I was happy with the Dash Mat I purchased this time as far as quality of the product . I was disappointed that everywhere I turned I could not get a color picture of the actual color of the Dash Mat I get that maybe there were only a couple of colors and I think a couple might look good either way . None the less because I wasn't shown a full bill of goods so to speak I have to deduct 1 star for not giving all the info. The product Dash Mat is an awesome product otherwise as it cools your dash off and keeps even dust fom being a big problem but the biggie is the lowering of solar radiation through the windshield . As a resident of Arizona I can appreciate even a few degrees lowered temp on a110 degree day.
127510,2,"I've owned two versions of this gauge: An LCD version that I bought 7 or 8 years ago, and the more recent LED type. Aside from the display technology, they looked identical.They were both accurate and reliable, but they both also had very poor sealing against the tire valve. The rubber ring that seals against the valve is too hard and uneven. You have to line the gauge up very precisely, and press very hard to avoid a burst of air escaping from the tire. If you don't get a good seal, the reading can be off, and a couple of bursts of air is enough to drop a tire by 1 psi. Every time I checked my tires, this happened on at least one or two of them. It's bad enough that I got into the habit of overfilling the tires by a couple of psi so that when this happened I would not end up below the desired pressure.I finally got tired of it and bought a $26.00 gauge at Sears that seems to be just as accurate and does not have this problem."
109366,1,This is a pretty good product for the money. It is not quite as good as some of the reviews lead me to believe. I also found that the tire pressure sensors in the car are not exactly correct either with a varence of +/_ .5 pounds.
141385,1,great price and quality. perfect fit. much better than the store brands at a great price.cheap quick and easy fix for truck
172237,2,Failed in 2 months. I bought this so I didn't have to reuse the 13 year old original one on a new fuel pump and have it fail a couple months later. Turns out this one failed in 2 months and now the 13 year old sensor is installed. Look for a better brand.
132642,1,"I like the multimeter. However, I bought it mainly for the Hz function. While it does read 60.0 Hz on house current (which you would expect), I bought it to check the Hz on my generator. For that it seems to read the 3rd harmonic of 181 Hz. It may just be the fault of the generator as I don't have a more expensive meter such as a Fluke to compare readings."
157284,0,"Not sure if the vehicle just stays in place or these chocks lock the wheels. From what I experienced, they will not stay attached to the bottom of the wheel even after I push them in with a couple of blows of a rubber mallet. Since the aim is ""safety first"" I'd use them even if I am convinced that the vehicle is not going to move. I can guess and say that different surfaces will make it more or less slippery for the product."

I really like them - they're my third pair (maybe they could be more durable ;) ) HOWEVER - Sometime between my second and third (and fourth - I'll explain) pair, Alipinestars apparently lost their mind with regard to sizing. The whole story is a bit long and tedious, but the short version is, I bought a pair (my third) of XXL, same as my second pair, but they were too tight for comfort. I bought a fourth pair, also XXL, thinking the third pair had been mis-marked or mis-packaged, and they were ALSO too tight. I think Alipinestars has changed their concept of XXL, and it no longer fits my hands. I could try XXXL, but I'm getting a bit tired of playing size games."
23412,1,I picked up these nerf bars for my 2011 F250 Super Duty with a Crew Cab. Got them in a few days with free shipping from Amazon. I installed them in less than 90 minutes on a cold March day. Easy to install and they look great.I highly recommend them.

Got a used trailer inside was like new and I think this trailer sat unused for a few years in the sun.Now I need to get the oxidation off this used trailer we just bought. I tried regular Mcquires for cars clearcoat cleaner compound on a 3000 rpm polishing wheel. Not good enough.I ordered through Amazon McGuires RV 3 step oxidation compound 49, polish and wax. Fiberglass is a tougher finish then clearcoat and this Oxidation compound is designed to cut through and really remove all the garbage and oxidation built on the finish. It restored my dull slightly off white finish back to bright white and very shiny. As well as me tired, But its well worth the effort. If you are taking on a whole boat or RV by the 3 step Rv kit for 25.00 on Amazon. I bought an extra bottle of 49 heavy duty because 1 16 oz bottle ran short.WARNING!........Their is nothing that will work without the right tools, time, strenth and energy involved in taking on this big a surface on 29 ft Rv with slide outs. You need a polishing wheel ( Not an orbital buffer they are not powerfull at all. I tried the dual action kind they are easier to controll but I like the speed of reg car polisher and prefer the 10 lb 7 inch 3000 rpm wheel using McGuires medium cut rasberry colored foam pad. Made just for taking oxidation safely out of the fiberglass.I started on the full molded fiberglass cap front. IT had a dull SATIN LIKE white finish on it very minimal shine. After applying the compound with 3000 rpm wheel, polish then wax which goes on easy and I did by hand. The compound is what does all the work to remove oxidation. Its as shiny as a new trailer or a new bathroom tub at Lowes.LET ME TELL YOU THE SHINE JUST AFTER USING THE COMPOUND IS AMAZING! IT works as its advertised. Then you follow up with the polish on a rag and wipe it off right away. Polish takes off any film left by compound and adds oils back to finish. They have a pure wax.Once you complete the 3 steps you will be happy you put in the time. Its really new looking.Its a extreamly hard job.Takes per side about 4 hrs but I have to stop because it will wear you out holding polisher tightly and letting wheel and compound do its job.Its a good workout. But the end results are well worth the time. My trailer had medium oxidation, but people who used it that claim they started with a chalky finish have had the same end results based on the reviews I read on Amazon.I AM sure with a BAD OXIDIZED chalky finish you will need to constantly clean the oxididation it removes off the pad.But years of not cleaning and waxing require the pain staking process that goes along with removing all the dead finish to get down to fresh.Tip.... For cleaning deep dirt on caulking I carefull use lacquire thinner on a small clean rag just folded to touch the caulking only. The thinner will melt the top layer of caulk every so slightly and remove the dirt instantly. Let it dry and then follow over the area with the wax, the wax will remove the film left behind and leave you trailer caulk look like new again. Dont effect the fiberglass Wont work if caulk is silicone.Try on small area to see results on you unit.Please note.......... My trailer is 5 years old and though it was oxidized some but a dull shine was still appearant, I knew the gelcoat seemed still good. If your unit has been neglected for say 10 years or more it may be possible that the oxidation has gone beyond the Gelcoat finish which gives the fiberglass its shine. If so, You really have nothing to shine back up. 3 part restorer will remove the oxidation then the polish and wax will add oils back to finish but without the high gloss shine if the gelcoat is gone. Also the dullness may return as the oils dry out over the following weeks of months depending on fiberglass gel coat in bad condition. But it has to be really bad looking and chalky to have killed gelcoat finish.I would try a small section on an older unit and see if you get that desired shine before spending your efforts to restore the entire unit. If that is the case their are other polymer finishes that coat over the dead finish once you clear off dead oxidation and create a new shiny type coating that they claim will hold a nice shine back to old finish. I am sure you can see them on the net. People seem to like these products as well. I would only consider going that route if you indeed do not have a chance of restoring the gelcoat. At that point you have nothing to lose but you will have to reapply that polymer finish every year. But it seems easy as waxing the whole unit. But at least you still have an option.A new units a lot of money a few days, a wheel, and this product on your unit can look great again.Ill be done tomarrow,Been a long few days. Then cover this trailer up for the winter and know this will be the last time I will have to compound it due to how I take care of my stuff. Because its now going to be garage kept, covered washed and waxed as it should be. McGuiares products always do as they claim as long as your Gel coat is still their under oxidation. It cant bring a dead finish alive when its past that point. I love the results. Made me a tired but a very happy man. Why no voting buttons?

110243,1,"I have used redline in my M3's transmission for few months, but there was a major difference in shifting after replacing transmission fluid with RP synchromax. Gears are alot smoother and easier to shift even with a short shifter. I will try other RP products in the future for sure."
166577,0,"I use the Hopkins 47385 Multi-Tow Adapter on a 2010 Chevy Tahoe. The 4-pin and 5-pin connections make the product very versatile for different types of commonly wired trailers. Not sure why the dust covers for the 4-pin and 5-pin connections aren't shown in the picture, but they come with the product and stay attached to the tow adapter. You do need to pull the dust covers straight off the pins to avoid damaging the ground pin. Be sure and read the review by Corn-Picker dated 01-13-12 to get further information on the product design flaw.I leave the tow adapter plugged into the vehicle at all times."
84496,0,This switch is not compatible with the My 1984 CJ-7 even thought I found it by searching by make model and year. After a little modification I was able to make it fit only to find out that it is for the intermittent wipers. I would not recommend this product to anyone that owns a CJ-7.
5558,1,"Very nice mufflers, sound is incredible, low but just not too much.Also good service from Amazone, good job guys!"
18181,1,This tool is great and well made and gets the job done fast. The way the jaws can clamp down on the gear being pulled is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone.
108736,2,I'm so tired of replacing these tires every 2ooo miles or so. I am out of the Dunlop business. Kenda probably has better longevity. They ride good but geeze. I wouldn't recommend these. I have to replace almost every year and I really don't ride that much
53454,0,"I liked the idea of this & have had one before. I was disappointed in this one because it broke within about 2 weeks, at the bottom, where it's supposed to adjust to fit in the cup holder. I still may try another one."
84013,2,"I agree with Mike's review. The was too big to fit over the original equipment mirror. I had to fold the two-sided tape several times to stick it over my original mirror so it would adhere. This did not make an effecient method of mounting the mirror and the mirror sags. I am currently looking for a spacer I can make to attach the Dorman mirror to the spacer and the spacer to my original mirror. If you can find a better way to attach it or have it cut to size, the mirror would be fine."
61461,0,Original item arrived broke in a repackage but they stood behind their product and replaced it promptly. I would buy from them again and am totally satisfied with the overall experience.

89655,2,"I use a portable toilet weekly. The CONS: The bowl holds liquid & needs to be wiped clean after each use. OR liquid stands on the lip of the bowel. It is a little awkward to carry & dump. The flush is had to pull The spout has to be cleaned and DRYED put back underneath, The spout touches the floor.PROs: The seat is comfortable. It holds plenty. Looks nice.ALL in ALL I would not buy this Portable Toilet, again."
134506,1,I put this is a custom Harley instead of a car and it worked great. Price is bestt around too!
166450,0,"Although the calipers are now protected from corrosion and look much better than before, the paint didn't give as good a coverage as I was hoping for. The primary problem I had was that the silver paint did not mix well and most of my first coat was more clear than color. After I had used most of the paint (in the third coat) it was almost all color and was providing much better coverage but the paint was also curing in the can and my time was running out to use it up. Maybe i needed to do a better job of stirring or shaking the paint before using, so I can't say for certain that it was a problem with the product itself.What was definitely a problem was the cheap foam paint brush included in the kit which came apart as I was finishing my first coat of paint. If I hadn't bought two extra brushes before starting I would have wasted the the rest of the paint, having nothing to apply it with. If I spend extra money on what should be a high quality paint, everything provided in the kit should be of the same high quality."
129465,1,I recently purchased this clip to moumt a Curtis roof rack on top of our 2007 Mitsubishi Galant. Loaded the rack with at least 100 pounds of cargo and took it for a 1200 mile road trip. The clip never gave a hint of budging and was as solid as a rock throuout the entire trip. The hardware was easy to install and removes even quicker!
57732,0,I expected since it was a premium grade tape that this would be a superior product. It does not leave any adhesive behind when removed which is really good. But it didn't hold as well as I expected it would. I will try another company and see if I can find a better quality gaffers tape.

175534,0,This item was received promptly and was easy to install on my seatbelt. I hoped it would be padded a little heavier than it is. It is better than using just the seatbelt but better products are out there.
134178,0,"This nozzle worked well for 3 years. It is very easy to control the rate of water and has a very sturdy feel/construction. Unfortunately the tip of the nozzle fell off after about three years of moderate use (maybe twice a week), making the nozzle useless."
30828,1,Wolo has great products. These air horns were a gift to my son who got a new diesel truck.Had a friend install them and are they loud.Wolo has the best horns and Amazon has the best prices!
116860,2,"I used to have a similar product that I paid about 13 bucks for at Radio shack, that product worked well and w/out any problems.. This Accutire MS-4350B product does work & has a couple of better features, but the main problem is that it takes multiple efforts to secure the mouth of the gauge around the tire nozzle, this sounds like nothing, but believe me, its tedious.. All I really wanted was to check my tire pressure easily, go to radio shack and see if u can get the one I used to have, its much better."
87329,0,"Bought this for a 1982 Yamaha 650 Seca. Fits properly, but wish it came pre-oiled like other K&N filters. The informational sheet says to use 3/4 of the oil packet, but following K&N's directions to oil every crease, I easily used the entire tube."
127184,2,"The title sums it up. Went to top off a new battery, the charger hummed and before I could unplug it I saw the genie escape and now I have an 11 pound $50 black box that does nothing. I could send it back for repairs, but after paying for shipping I'd have more invested in it than it is worth ... wait, I already do. Schumacher's certainly aren't what they used to be. My model CR312 still works after +20 hard years."
100345,0,"the reason i bought this item was because i broke the taillight on my four wheeler and i had gotten an Amazon gift card so instead of spending money on a cover i just bought this. what you see in the picture is what you get. It is 3 lights in plastic covers on a strip of metal. I had to run a ground wire from the inside since it grounded threw its mounts (i was mounting it with zip ties) and sealed the lights with hot glue (its on a four wheeler and if the light goes under water what happens when you take hot glass and get it cold really fast, it cracks or explodes) i also spray painted mine black for a better look. I have only used my fourwheeler a few times since i put the lights on but so far they work and look really nice."
77369,0,"Mounting cup was as advertised- came with a good assortment of fittings, screws and hoses to provide a wide range of mounting options. I used it as a mounting cup for my Subaru WRX ""SPT"" Boost Gauge- Looks good. Real composite, not ""carbon look""."
142685,2,"I put this stuff on my trim, followed directions exactly. Not even two days later, there were stains on the car from where the product ran off after a light rain. Mailing this garbage back to Amazon."
87745,1,"I've been having issues with my alternator lately not charging my battery. The alternator is just a year old, and my battery is 4 years old. Thought it might be a bad voltage meter. I finally decided to view digital multimeter and analyzers at Amazon. I read the reviews on this particular model and found it quite favorable. I received it very quickly and gave it a try. Come to find out the alternator wasn't charging the battery. This item helped me out a lot. My mechanic checked it out and told me it was a very good investment. I would highly recommend this product for their car or home use."
119449,0,"The good news is that I received the item quicker than I expected. The bad news is that I had to make slight modifications to the part so that it would fit. The holes in the flange that bolts to the exhaust manifold were too small. I had to drill them out larger so that it would fit on the exhaust manifold studs. Once I had it installed, I discovered another problem; the front O2 sensor would not go in. I had to remove the converter and use a dremel to grind down some extra weld material so that the O2 sensor would go in. Other than those 2 items, the price was right and it worked fine."
111966,1,This item is lightweight and easy to use. It uses one C battery. The cold weather may affect the batteries and affect how well the sparker works so keep this in mind.
106108,1,"The K&N Replacement Filter for the Road Star is a medium difficulty shade tree mechanic task. I call it medium only because the Road Star's filter box is not the easiest to remove and most people will need a long-nose plier to get the breather hose off the back of the filter box. The K&N filter has well over twice the ""breathable"" surface area of the stock Yamaha filter and the oiled fabric of the K&N flows a lot more air per square inch than the stock paper filter. The difference is immediately noticeable at idle - the bike no longer feels like it's gasping for breath as it idles. The difference is even more noticeable when riding - the bike pulls harder and smoother from idle all the way through the power band, accelerates more crisply, and doesn't surge like the stock filter did. For riders who keep the stock exhaust or go with a moderately higher flow after-market system, the K&N Replacement Filter offers all the air flow needed. I've used K&N for years and will always replace the stock air filter with a K&N when one is available."
136403,1,"Bumper arrived in good condition via fedex on time, with one small scratch and rustoleum textured paint covered it no noticeable difference. When speaking to manufacture was told it came with winch mount. Note: winch mount is extra didn't come with it, as was told by manufacture. Over all a great look and 4 tabs for off road lights. My friends say I got my girl friend a boob job and she looks hot. It's a jeep thing. i would recommend this bumper great look and very rugid easily installed in 10 min. looks great and functions exellent with smittybilt rc8000 winch.Smittybilt 76721 SRC Front Bumper"
155807,1,I couldnt find this product in any stores and so i bought it from amazon. Works great like it supposed to. No problems.
82650,0,"As warned by several reviewers, mine is slightly scratched in the center. I don't particularly care, but it is lame after this many complaints. More annoying is that I saw the same basic product for half the price at a local rx."
26625,1,"I've had this ratcheting cargo bar for quite a while now and use it practically every day in my pickup with Tonneau Cover (might be why its lasted so long.) used mainly in combination with plastic crates, it works great to keep groceries and other cargo secure. Good product!"
14468,2,"Not much to say here except you get what you pay for. If you want pegs that can't really be placed where you want them, are cheap feeling, will scratch your bars and will move when you use them no matter how tight they are, well, these are your pegs. I regret buying them."
75273,1,"I bought these for my boyfriend last Christmas (almost a year ago now). He is a pizza delivery driver and wanted a way to keep his windows slightly open on rainy days so that he and the food wouldn't get soaked and so the food wouldn't fog up all of his windows. These worked, and still work, great! I'm actually really surprised that none of them have fallen off over the course of the past year and I'm very glad I bought them!"
146785,0,"The instructions lack alot to desire. Infact they don't even tell you mix ratios, you'll need to search the web for this. Doing what the instructions say to do is extreamly tedious, time consuming and painfull to do properly. The product is very professional, however I've had mixed results with how well it holds up for repairs. In summary it's worth a try, however it's not worth counting on this working or holding up over time."
148472,1,"Looks good, fits well. I think it will keep the plug for my trailer dry and clean. Looks well made"
66371,2,"this stuff smells bad, I had to open the garage because i could not stand how bad it smells. This product is soso, I would not recommend it. it also does'nt change color once sprayed on part, it just becomes glazed. not satisfied at all.."
79560,2,Price is nice but the product is not. Installed it and the chord it came with did not make connection with the pins at all. Not only was the chord junk but it started leaking drips of coolant throughout the element seals not where it goes into the block but where the chord connects too so now I had a bad chord and coolant entering the electrical side of the component and even heard a small arc/pop inside the chord when I tried to plug it in one last time. Returned it and requested a refund too much mess to deal with a sub par component that didn't even work by the end of the first week

7157,0,"This was a breeze to put in and worked fine at first. However, it only lasted 6 months before it failed. I took it out and found that nylon pulley assembly at the top broke. The cable lost all tension and binded up. I don't know if this is typical or not, but I'm a trying different brand this time.Just wanted to post helpful hints to gain access. This written for a 2004 Le Sabre.Pull the speaker mounted at the top, forward portion of the door panel. It is secured by one of those plastic push tabs, so it merely pops out. Pry more from the top edge - it has plastic tabs on its bottom, that slip down behind the door panel.The trim panel behind the inside door latch handle must be removed to gain access to a screw behind it. It is removed by prying at the forward edge of the trim panel. This panel then moves forward and off. There are hooks on the aft side of the panel, so don't pry on the aft side! The screw behind this panel is the only one that must be removed to get the door panel off. Once the screw is off, pop the edges of the door panel loose around its perimeter (forward, aft, bottom). You can then lift the panel off the door.Note that if you need to jam the window up while you are waiting for this part to come in, you will probably have to cut the cable in the defective regulator assembly(cut them from inside the door panel). This cable looks like bicycle brake/derailleur cable. Once the cable is cut, you can merely push the window up, then wedge some wood or something to keep it up."
81827,1,THE PERMATEX FABRIC REPAIR KIT DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB FOR THE COST AND EASE OF USE. MATCHING THE FABRIC COLOR WAS EASY AND COVERED THE BURN HOLE WELL.
164138,1,Item arrived quickly - was a Christmas gift for my son. He loved it - said it was easy to install. Time will tell I suppose.
171125,2,"Bought a set of these for my Jag XJS. They were purported to be custom cut but they do not fit the foot well and have to have folds along the edges and are not fitted like originals are.Trying to make contact to anyone that cares or could do anything is impossible.Will be returning these and will get a proper set.I wonder if any other vehicles have the same issues, but seems that for my Jag, their template was off."
137324,0,This cover keeps my car protected and the price was low. It's not fancy nor perfectly fitted to my MINI Convertable but I'm pleased.

131923,0,"This product was great at $19.99. Went to order another set to find out that the price has now been raised to $25. Mothers sells a nice buffer ball attachment for $19.99. Granted it's only one, but it last longer and can be reused. These buffing pads are pretty much a one time use... If they bring their price back down to $19.99, I'll change my rating from 3 to 5 stars."
121806,0,I wish it would have been longer as I have a big battery in my diesel and it only covers 3 sides of the battery. I only used it ounce so far so I have not given it a thorough enough test to make a rating on it.I do not know if they have bigger ones then I got but I should have gotten something bigger.
20591,0,Nice looking leather good quality rec'd in the time announced have not used it yet because of the rainy season which is about to begin here in Northern Cali.
74515,1,"""Beautiful"" is a strange term for utilitarian products like hitches but the design of this is truly a work of art. I've owned dozens of the nasty black (then rusty) hitches (I owned an equipment rental store)--your hands get dirty handling them then you put your nasty hands on your high-dollar leather-wrapped steering wheel--no such problem here. I bought this hitch and a stainless steel ball (from Amazon, naturally) because I wanted the business end of my 2013 Avalanche to look as good as the rest of the truck. Yeah, it costs maybe 20 bucks more than the nasty hitch but what did you pay for your truck? Another benefit is that this hitch is rated for heavier tow loads than most steel hitches. Buy this; you'll be happy!"

132913,0,This is a good charger but not great. The smart aspect of this charger sometimes doesn't let me charge batteries that can still be rescued. The low jump start amp rating is also limited to small passenger cars and won't kick over my camper or a large pickup.
185774,2,"As with the other three reviewers of this product, I found that this ""replacement"" part is not an OEM equivalent. The overall length of the lift is approximately two inches shorter than the parts that came from BMW. When these are installed and the hood is ""up"", it sits about six inches lower than the original design. To make matters worse, the product description does not include the compressed and uncompressed length information so there is no way to compare what you are ordering against what you need until after you take delivery. If I had known the length it would have been obvious that these wouldn't do.As a weekend DIY mechanic who repairs his own vehicles (3 cars, a truck, 2 boats and lots of yard equipment), there is no way would I ever recommend this product.Amazon was great about taking them back (best online retailer in the world, bar none)."

150408,0,"The Tourmaster/Cortech DSX denim motorcycle pants are what I was looking for to ride in the warmer weather. They are comfortable while riding since they seem to be more breathable than the padded motorcycle pants that I usually wear. Denim, though, can be really oppressive in the hot humid weather when you finally get to your destination.I find that the plastic knee protectors (which are removable) tend to bother me when walking around because the top of the protector hits the bottom of my knee cap unless I pull the pants way up around the top of my waist. In that case I take the protectors out."

174538,1,"Purchased a set of chrome door handles to match a the sets of buckets I purchased earlier (that's a different review). From 5 feet or more, they look excellent, however it seems like the company that makes them have little or no quality control. The chroming process had runoff in some areas, making it thicker in some areas...causing for a tight fit. One handle came out of the plastic packaging with 2 small nicks in it...it should be baby bottom smooth. That same one had machining grime on it....again, a good quality control person would either catch this, or all items should be washed before being shipped.Since I did not want the cheaper covers I am willing to work any minor issues, they still really look good, and decent price for what you are getting they get a good rating from me. If they step up their quality control, rating would go up."

84221,1,This item bolts to the u-bolts on the drivers side axle if you have a Rancho lift and u-bolts it comes with nuts and fits. My problem is I have a Skyjacker lift and the nuts do not fit so I installed it as a single stabilizer on the passenger side factory mount. Guess I have a spare stabilizer when mine needs replacement.
123377,0,"For the price paid, it does its job. But the Xantrex units are superior.Here's why:1. It's made of plastic, therefore the lack of aluminum heatsinking means the BD must run a fan constantly when on. It adds noise.2. When used to power a laptop adapter, the laptop picks up a buzzing noise from the BD which can be heard over the laptop's audio output.:(3.

8173,2,"I ordered a black Dashmat for my 1992 Cadillac Seville. It arrive timely enought, but went downhill from there. It does not accurately fit into the space of the dashboard top, and overhangs the dash about 2 inches. It is too wide and does not line-up with the defrost vent. Poor quality obviously not made for my exact model of Cadillac, 1992 Seville, the model just prior to the Northstar change. I'm so disgusted that I don't even feel like wasting the time to send it back. Thanks for the wasted time and money. Tom Wolf, (760)270-4515."

60431,0,OEM is a brand and this part was made in China but it seems to be working. It was less than half price of the motorcraft. I think it's ok to get the cheap part for this sensor but not other parts. I kept the old one which was still working just in case (the mechanic I had did not follow my instructions to only replace it if needed). It fit and works to that's good.
145345,0,"After doing a bit of research I found out this is a ""magnafine"" filter with a Raybestos label in an ATP box.Only finished installing it today in my 2000 Honda Civic which has a small filter screen buried in the transmission and a magnetic drain plug. I needed some sort of extra protection for my trans and this fits the bill.Package includes the filter and two hose clamps.If u need or want a magnafine inline filter and can't find it anywhere else...this is it~UPDATE~ (5th Jan 2012)I am dropping my original score of 5 stars to 3 stars. My filter has developed a leak after approx 7000km of use. It's a small leak now but i am forced to change it in the event that the leak gets larger and most of my fluid is pumped out during any journey and ruins my transmission.I will leave it with 3 stars for in the brief period that it did not leak it significantly reduced the small ""filings"" that would usually be found on the drain plug magnet.It works just check it occasionally."
66087,0,This stater does not fit on my truck even thought the description said will fit on a chevy eight cyclinder 350. I gave the starter to my brother who was able to use it for his truck. I can not judge the quality of this starter but it is a remanufacture from China. I am sure it works since my brother been driving his truck with out walking due to a break down.

Also, the hood pin is plastic and broke off in 20 degree temperatures, disabling the remote start, and no replacement available on company website!!!"

163661,1,"We just had ""new carpet"" installed 12/04/2012. Later that night I noticed two round black spots on two different steps coming from our family room. I used warm water and a lot of ""elbow it removed some but not all. The rep came back two days later for other business. She used soap and water and said to call her if the stain remained. On 12/07/2012 I got a follow-up call about the installation and the installers passed with flying colors. I then told the follow-up person about the two spots on the carpet. She scheduled with me to have someone from her company to come and look at the spots and said that they would first try to clean it up before replacing that area of the rug. I then requested the same installers to return and see the spots. WELL TO MY SURPRISE THEY HAD OIL-FLO-141 with them but they said they did not sale it. Listen; I do not think that it took two (2) minutes before the stains totally disappeared with a dabbing motion . I wrote down the name of the product and this is why I am purchasing this product today. You won't be sorry. We were very impressed with OIL-FLO-141 and now we are prepared for ANYTHING THAT MIGHT GET ON OUR NEW CARPET:>)!!!"

38657,1,"Fit it on my subaru impreza and it is perfect. Just the right height and size. Pricey, but it's well made. Way better than the stock plastic shifter knob fitted on most ""economy"" cars. It's worth the upgrade if you find your shifter to be a little too low or small.One thing to consider is that this is just like any other universal shifter kit. It doesn't screw in like your factory knob. It has three screws that hold it in place. So when you're installing it, wrap a good amount of electrical tape at the base of the shifter where the screws will go in. Make it so it feels solid without the screws. Then line everything up and set the screws in tight. This way you will avoid having to adjust for a lot of play as everything wears in and it feels more solid in general."
48345,0,"Overall works pretty well.Positives:- All hoses and wires and adaptors store inside the unit, for neatness.- built-in handle is nice- long 12V auto power cord- two-year warrantyNegatives:- When it stops automatically after inflating one item (such as a tire), it must be turned off and back on to inflate another item, or to increase pressure setting and continue filling.- the AC power cord is extremely short. Pretty much requires an extension cord.- the air hose is fairly short.- The noise it makes is quite loud, though not as loud as some I've heard.- fitting the cords and hose back into the storage compartment is not easy.- the valve adapter is plastic, not metal, and doesn't seem sturdy. It works so far, however."

But subsequent uses of it have resulted in the zipper not staying together, and last time we used it I even went so far as to employ that modern miracle, duct tape. Maybe it's my fault, maybe I over-stuffed the bag. But from other reviews I was expecting more. However, the price is right if your expectations aren't too high."
126363,2,"These wiper blades are excellent at cleaning the glass. They leave a silicon coating behind that allows the rain to sheet off at high speeds. The coating doesn't work as well as rain-x. Rain-x starts sheeting around 45-50mph, the piaa wipers coating not until 60+mph. However, any time you need to use your wipers they leave a white streak across the windshield that doesn't disappear for a second or two. At night, the streaking catches all surrounding light and is blinding. It's like someone flashing their bright lights at you every time the wipers go across the windshield. The silicon residue is a great idea in theory, but in practice they are the WORST WIPERS EVER! They're DANGEROUS!"

I think it's called highway robbery in some circles.That having been said they do help IF YOU HAVE A SUPERCHARGED MUSTANG OR NITROUS INJECTED MUSTANG. THAT'S IT. There is no HP gain by using these plugs in a N/A engine, so don't let your buddy talk you into buying a set because he heard you can get more power outta them... you can't!Other than that, these are the hardest plugs to install, torque them at 25 lbs and gap them between 32-38 (depends on boost or nitrous shot size).Oh and you have to buy a special gapper, the old style won't work, trust me!"
93882,1,I bought this to keep track of service on my multiquip gaw 180 he welder generator. Since it is very expensive i want to keep track of servicing. I got the genset for free from my job with no compression. I rebuilt the engine so to keep it peak i bought this. $ 27 beats $1400 for new engine any day!!! The genset retails for $3100 and is Honda powered.
109717,0,And that's about the size of it. Mounted on '07 Roadstar w/ms batwing. To be honest with you I really don't care for the looks of it on my bike. As far as I'm concerned it's too big and ugly. Looks like a chrome mantel clock sitting there in the middle of the handle bars. Very obtrusive. I would have been much happier with a smaller unit I could mount anywhere. I may return.
168887,2,"I have been buying things online for years and have never had so much trouble. I was sent the wrong part months ago and emailed the seller. Some how most of my emails got sent to the spam folder. I have tried calling 3 times a day for weeks and nothing. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because i got my money back, but it would be nice to have the part i ordered 3 months ago."
845,2,"The lock on these caps is mereley a placebo and a false sense of security. I was having fuel stolen from my vehicle on a regular basis and figured the $20 to lock the cap was worth it. Fuel theft continued shortly after so I decided to see how difficult it was to pick the lock. With a simple Google search I found that a bent paperclip or bobby pin would release the lock. I also discovered that if you jam a similarly sized key in and turn to the unlock position... the lock cylinder comes out and the cap is in the unlock position with no damage to the entire product. The cylinder will then simply pop back in with absolutely no sign of tampering.Not only that, but the cylinder number is etched directly on the lock bezel and keys, so if you have a repeat offender all they need to do is merely shoplift a very small set of keys that match (possibly dozens or hundreds) and they have valid access to any number of ""locked"" fuel caps."
33567,0,"I bought this part back early in 2011 to troubleshoot an ignition problem I thought I had. the problem ended up being the knock sensor, so nothing ever changed when I replaced the Toyota coil with this one from Beck/Arnley. All I can say is that I was driving up a hill at 9:30 PM and the engine surged once and I had to fight to get over to the shoulder of the road. The younger kids were scared and I ended up having to have my wife come pick them up, while I waited for a $275 tow back home. I replaced the old coil, it works great again. I plugged the Beck/Arnley one back in just to recheck it in case of a bad connection and it still didn't work. Next time, I'll pay the extra for the OEM part."
17721,2,"First let me state that I'm an avid Amazon.com shopper. I always seem to find the best deals on Amazon.When I opened this particular item, I was a bit shocked to see that the color was not solid black or gray. Instead it was a very dark shade of gray or black with light gray specs all over it. Not sure if it was because of the tweed material or not. Amazon's customer service department quickly refunded my money without too many questions but I have to say this was the first time that I found the picture and/or description to be misleading.I blame myself a bit too. I should of read all of the reviews. For those looking at this item, please know there are many vendors on Amazon selling the same thing. To get an accurate review, you need to search all Saddleman Seat Covers. You will see what I'm talking about.Quality - Poor for $120.00 - Thin, flemsy, poor fabric.

I usually use Royal Purple which Is in my opinion, better and fantastic. The reason I give Mobil 1 three stars is because it is not exceptional. It just does it's job and does it well. No trick up it's sleeves and normally I'd give five stars for something I like and use that ""Just works"" however, and with engine oil, I'm a bit more reserved."

100333,0,"Well it did a good job of shining the car. But the thing is the shine did not last very long. I am not sure if that is because mine expired or something. When I opened the container, it was filled with some kind of clear liquid and the polish it self was kind of like jello. I knew that was not the way it was supposed to be. I used it anyway and it did shine the car, just not for long."
117355,1,"Hawk HPS HB478F.605These Hawk HPS pads are designed for the rear brakes on a multitude of cars, including the Solstice GXP, Sky Redline, Mazda3, Volvo C30/S40, and Cobalt SS Turbocharged.Hawk makes several brake pads for street and racing applications. The HPS and Performance Ceramic are intended for street applications, while HP Plus, Blue, and a few other lines are intended for racing. The racing pads create a lot of dust, don't last very long, and produce a lot of noise in certain instances. Hawk is just a brand of Wellman, who makes lots of friction materials for heavy-duty applications. These are my second set of Hawk pads and Wellman's customer service is one of the best I have seen in the industry.The Hawk pads always come with a logo sticker, high temp grease, and the pads themselves. The HPS pads are supposed to be a more performance oriented pad material compared to the ceramic. Based on a lot of feedback, the Ceramic pads actually produce more dust than the HPS but the HPS has better stopping power overall. Ceramic pads are generally designed for longevity, they have the tendency to wear down rotors in some formulations. The HPS friction materials are advertised as a Ferro-carbon material, or more commonly known as a carbon metallic compound. The benefit of this material is its ability to mitigate heat. They don't tend to play well in cold situations though.The Hawk pads are supposed to employ the Noise Reduction System (NRS) technology that uses a lot of tiny hooks in the backing plate to retain the friction material. In the past, manufacturers relied on adhesives or rivets which can break apart. I've actually had one set of Raybestos pads break apart because rust developed in the backing plate causing the adhesive to give out.I installed the HPS pads very easily and applied high temp grease to all the backing plate surfaces that would touch the pistons, calipers, or anchor plates. You want to do this to reduce squealing/harmonics/vibration. When people complain about brake squeal on new pads, its usually because they didn't apply the grease properly. I've never experienced heavy dusting from HPS pads in the past and they tend to perform very well at high temperatures. At cold temperatures, they don't stop nearly as well as when they're hot, but it has not bothered me at this point. Usually after the first few stops leaving a subdivision will heat them adequately.The most important part of installing new pads is the break-in or bedding procedure. If you're re-using rotors, use some sandpaper to clean up the rotor surface. The reason is that brake pads leave a film of friction material on the rotor surface. This is what the pads rely on rubbing to stop the car, it's not supposed to rub directly into the rotor surface. The bedding procedure is typically 10 stops from 30 MPH with moderate brake pedal pressure. Allow it to cool a little but never come to a complete stop. Then perform 3 more stops from 45-50 MPH using harder brake pedal pressure. By this time you can usually smell the pads! Try to park it somewhere for 15 minutes without coming to a complete stop using the pads - usually coasting in neutral in a parking lot then letting it stop is a good way to go. This will reduce the chance of getting flat spots on the rotor which is commonly known as ""warped"" rotors.The dust that comes off these pads were a very light tan color which wasn't too obvious even on chrome wheels. It is easy to clean off, just make sure to wax your wheels.Pros: Easy to install, excellent high temperature performance, low dust, low noiseCons: Bedding procedure can be a hassle but this applies to ALL brake pads, even OEM. The Hawk pads cost a bit more than OEM, and a lot more than cheap local brands but it is worth it. Cold temp stopping isn't that great, but they love heat.Overall: 5/5 stars."

It includes a vast collection of adapters and seems well built (minus some surface rust on the press itself).However, after using this press for the first time on my 09' JK, it's obvious the press itself is not heavy duty. Trying to press out the lower ball joint I was able to bend/spread the c-press into almost a Y shape with heavy pressure from a 1/2"" breaker bar. I was not able to remove the joint as this thing just kept bending further and further. Returning for either the OTC or Alltrade version."

I figured the netting would be 60"" minimum leaving 3"" on each side. WRONG! The net is so short that there is 5""+ gap on each side. (54"" net) This is probably a dangerous situation for something that is supposed to keep stuff in the bed. It seems like a sturdy device, the metal tubes are quite rigid, however, they were cut to length after the tube was protectively coated.... so the cut ends will rust immediately I'm sure. Also, the cut ends are rolled in to a smaller diameter when cut...this binds on the sliding tube. (The end tubes slide so you can remove the unit.) So it will not be a few seconds to remove/replace this each time you want to use it...especially when it starts to rust!"

I later realized I had overloaded the bag by about 50-75 pounds, but you wouldn't know - the bag held together fine. We took about two weeks to drive from coast to coast, logging numerous miles on side trips and stops - we usually left the bag on the roof but in a few locations took it off for security - it was minimal effort to remove (about 5 mins) then replace the next morning. It is also important to note that we did find inclement weather (hard rain) going through South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana. I was worried because I had left some important documents in the suit case on the roof, but no worries - there was not even condensation in the roof bag! Bottom line - well worth the cost, very durable, easy to install and remove, protects against the elements. Only suggestion - include more straps 4 was not enough - we bought 2 32"" bungie cables to ensure the load didn't shift."
158736,2,Ten stitches into installation and the needle broke. I gave up and threw it away when it was clear that it was way too big for my 14 1/4 inch steering wheel. I gambled on this one versus one costing three times as much. I lost.
98101,2,I bought this KD3253 oil filter wrench after being misled to believe that it would fit my 2009 Toyota RAV4. What a big mistake! It just wasted my money and time. Hope this will help if you are a 2009 RAV4 onwer looking for an oil filter wrench.
10647,1,Bought this item as a gift for a family member but fell in love with it when it got here! It is very well made and sturdy when put together but also folds in on its self for easy storage. I would highly recommend this item to everybody for their vehicles! Great for shopping trips to Sam's Club or Costco too.
17895,2,Besides doing nothing to improve performance the manufacturer only wanted to fix the unbroken product when I asked for my money back! Dont be fooled this doesn't work and is a waste of money you cant get returned!

102235,1,"I have a large leather sofa near a big window. It's six months old and moderately good quality but not the best. I lightly clean it with a wet dishtowel with a few drops of Dr.Bronners, let it dry, and then about monthly spray it with the Blue Magic and use another tower to distribute it evenly.It only has a mild, pleasant odor, it dries quickly and is not greasy or slick at all, and it returns the leather to how it looked the day we received it. It also light tightens it.I'm going to continue using it."

120031,1,"I purchased this in SEP 2009 and it's still holding its place on the tow hitch of my truck. For its purpose, it has done well. The foam seal has kept water out of my hitch receiver as advertised and it definitely meets my requirement of having something different as I just don't like being the 10,000th person with a ""RAM"" or a ram head hitch cover. The only thing that got it a 4 star is that the tongue's red color only lasted about 3 months before it started fading and was basically completely gone in about 5 months. Not a big thing as I have model paints and touch up automotive paints to fix that when I get around to it. If you want something different as a hitch over, I would recommend this product."

Replaced light and added RTV to wire/housing area on new light.Also added two utility lights inside the rear hatch of the JEEP for work lights.

65899,1,"I'd give this 5 stars, but the telescopic pole isn't long enough (I'm only 5'6"") and doesn't stay ""locked""...pay attention California Mop people...that's an important improvement you could do! This sucker absolutely picks up dust and keeps it locked on the mop head. It won't pick up crumbs, etc....so I vacuum my hardwood floors first then use the mop. And if things are really out of hand, dirt-wise, I follow up with my steam mop. I've had several ""dust"" mops, and they fail after 5 minutes...this is the only one that really grabs and holds the dust, especially for large areas. My question is for anybody else who has this product....I shake it out several times during mopping (I have over 2500 sq ft of wood) and it looks pretty dirty afterwards....I see that you can wash it, but is that wise? And does CA Mop offer replacement mop heads? I'm thinking that would be handy...wash one, let it air dry, but still have another one ready to go. I don't see replacements here...? This definitely is the answer for me - but I'd like to see replacement mop heads and longer, locking pole."
154897,0,"I purchased these plugs to use in my 98 Saturn SL2. The first thing to do is inspect the plugs before installing them. The finished product isn't the best. The threads on one of the plugs had some burrs on it that concerned me to the point where I decided to dress it with a file first before installing it. If not, it could've cross threaded the head which would have been disastrous!!!The plugs come already gapped and aren't adjustable. There were some variances in the gaps. Since the variations were so slight, I felt it would not be an issue and decided to install them as is.I debated on whether or not to use anti seize and eventually decided against it. The website for the spark plug doesn't really recommend it. It says that the threads are nickel plated which help to resist seizing and galling. Even though the plugs are warrantied for 5 yrs./100k miles, I don't plan on leaving them in there that long.If you do plan on leaving the plugs in for a long time, anti seize would probably be a good idea. Don't forget to adjust the torque values if you decide to use anti seize.I just installed the plugs yesterday. The car seems to start up faster and has more pep when you hit the throttle. The old plugs that were removed were relatively new (5,000 miles on them) and in good condition so I don't think the improvements were a matter of worn plugs being replaced with new plugs. Even so, those things are hard to measure and open to the power of suggestion. The real test will be the miles per gallon, which I will be evaluating and reporting on after driving for approx. one month.Stay tuned!!!Update: It's one month and 1,200 miles later and the numbers are in.First, some driving impressions. The car does run smoother and has more power. The car maintains 65 mph on the freeway with less effort than it used to take. Before, I could feel the engine ""working"" to maintain 65 mph. Now it cruises at 65 and I need to keep an eye on the speedometer.Now the good stuff. My SL2 averaged 25.75 mpg versus 23.02 mpg for the month prior to installing the E3 spark plugs. I have to admit that because of the increased performance, my foot has been heavier on the gas pedal than normal so the mileage could possibly have been even a little better. All in all, I would say these spark plugs are a worth while purchase that will eventually pay for themselves."

But I was sick of my flashlight not being available at the garage door where I originally placed the clips. So I plunked down my money, re-installed the brackets and now very carefully (knowing how they will break again) put my maglite in place and remove just as carefully. Buyer beware but still a useful tool."

But I did not want to pay a lot of money for performance boots that are ugly. Then I found these Renegades. They fit my true shoe size, ordering on-line - that alone was impressive! They are constructed with bikers in mind and are top of the line in performance...fit, secure to stay ON, durable, great traction...and I think they are a GREAT look! Could not be happier! I've gotten many compliments on them from other lady riders."

34557,1,"The PIAA 1400 Series with the Dichroic Ion Crystal Fog Lamps are one of the best on the market for hazard and extreme foul weather lighting, especially fog. These are small lighting modules that you may underestimate there powerful potential. Installation and proper mounting of these lights are important for it's impact in distributing light in front of your car. Wiring looks kinda flimsy but if you add a plastic shrink tubing for protection then that's all you need. What's amazing about these lamps are they are non-reflective in any type of fog situation. These lamps are not meant to be used on a daily everyday driving as you would treat them like bright white driving lamps. If used as a daily driving lights the bulbs only last 1 year or less depending on usage. The housing is made of hard plastic and the mounts are metal coated for rust protection. Only one draw back about these lamps are finding replacement bulbs when they burn out. If you can fine 1 or 2 pairs I suggest in buying extra. Replacement bulbs are estimated around $40 each they may have gone lower.These lamps were outfitted onto a 1985 Toyota Landcruiser as this truck was heavily outfitted for 4x4 and it's lighting system. I have driven through some of the up most foul weather in the United States from New York to California, Florida to San Diego. Rain, snow, dust storms and heavy fog the performance of these lamps are impeccable.A great example is traveling from San Diego to Hermosa Beach using Interstate highway 5 going north from San Diego. From Oceanside to San Clemente I hit the thickest fog front in front of me with about 1 foot visibility in front of the truck without the fog lamps on. When I turned them on you can see a good 3+ car lengths in front. That evening I had a convoy of cars and trucks following me until the fog subsided.Even thou this truck is not with me I know whenever my parents go camping they can see in any foul weather."

25315,0,"I bought this universal oxygen sensor to replace the rear one that was mounted on the catalytic converter on my 2000 Honda Civic Si. I bought the universal to save about $70 or so over the ""exact fit"" replacement. But looking back on it now, I wish I had just spent the extra money for the ""exact fit"" version. To use this universal unit, you must reuse the electrical connector (leaving a length of wire attached) from you old sensor. It comes with crimp connectors so that you can splice the wires together, but I didn't have a wire crimping tool, so I soldered the wires together with a 25 watt iron utilizing the solder holes found on the crimping connectors. Everything appeared to look good, but after installation the new sensor was reporting a constant 1.28 volts and my car's computer threw a code P0138 (too high a voltage). I'm ASSUMING that the heat from my soldering job caused a short somewhere in the sensor itself or in the old connector. Of course I cannot return the sensor back to Amazon and I needed my car now, so I purchased an ""exact fit"" Bosch unit, from my local auto parts store, and it works perfectly.Based from my experience and money and time lost, my caveat if you buy one of these is to crimp (as instructed) and don't solder the wires together. Or buy the ""exact fit"" unit for the extra $70 or so. I did install another Denso oxygen sensor, an ""exact fit"" (no crimping) unit to replace the front unit, and that one works fine. Also, the Bosch sensor seems to perform well too even though it does not look exactly like the Denso (Honda OEM) part it replaced."
85544,0,I decided to purchase these chaps as an alternative to the the high dollar Harley chaps. After taking the appropriate measurements per instructions on the website I ordered 2 sizes up for a comfortable fit. This worked out ok but they are a bit loose. I should have gone one size up. One of the zipper pulls fell apart within the first couple of weeks. I took it to the local cobbler for a $10.00 repair. The chaps have a worse than normal odor. Much stronger and nastier than the usual new leather smell.I keep them hanging out in the garage. To say that they smell like a dead goat would be an understatement. I can live with them but perhaps I should have shopped a little more. For the little money spent I guess they are ok.

136094,0,"What you think about this ""A hangover is the wrath of grapes"" bumper sticker is contingent on a couple of things. By this I am talking about the contexts of history and literature rather than in terms of your feeling on the legal consumption of alcohol, family history, and your membership in organizations against drunk drivers predicated on your particular standing in your family. From either the historical or literary (or cinematic) perspective this particular bumper sticker is a twist on the phrase ""grapes of wrath.""Historically, the phrase originates in ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic,"" which was written during the American Civil War by Julia Ward Howe. Visiting a Union army camp near Washington, D.C., Howe heard soldiers singing the song ""John Brown's Body."" That night she awoke and wrote down the lyrics, which begin: ""Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord, He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored."" The hymn appeared in the ""Atlantic Monthly"" in 1862 and became the marching song of the Union. Those who are consumed by such things see a parallel between Howe's lyrics and the Bible verse Jeremiah 25:30: ""Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth."" Draw your own conclusions in that regard.In the late 1930s John Steinbeck arrived at the migrant camps in northern California. What he found there made him angry enough to write a novel about the desperate plight of these destitute people. Steinbeck got the title of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" from his wife at the time, Carol, who, of course, got it from ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" In its first year of publication in 1939 the story of the Joan family and their tragic journey from the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma to the failed promise land of California sold nearly half a million copies, and a year later was made into a classic American film by director John Ford starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell. The novel also has the virtue of having the greatest ending in American literature, albeit one that was unfilmable back then.The question then is whether you think the little comic reversal of turning ""the grapes of wrath"" into ""the wrath of grapes"" is cute enough to overcome the desecration of a hymn and/or great work of literature. In its favor it must be pointed out that the sentiment expressed on this bumper sticker is valid whether it results from the depths of personal experience or the insight of astute observation. The problem is that, by definition of practical purpose, whoever reads this particular bumper sticker bon mot is in a car behind you, and if the sentiment strikes them the wrong way as adding insult to injury, the fact remains: they are in a car behind you..."
67484,1,"Best price found, and no need to add friction additive, I have seen this stuff run 24/7 for years in gear boxs on conveyers, Cheaper in the long run.

95047,2,"Bought this for a 1999 Dodge Caravan, one of the models for which this hitch claims to work. As installed according to the instructions, it will rub against your exhaust pipe and you will have to keep your spare tire in your trunk. The only way to install it and keep your spare tire is to use an alternate set of bolt holes, which will then cause the hitch to lay about 4 inches from the ground. I even took it to a mechanic just to make sure I wasn't missing something and he confirmed that this hitch is simply not as universal as advertised.Spend a few extra bucks and buy a hitch specifically made for (or definitely known to work with) your vehicle instead of this ""universal"" hitch."
63827,1,"This scanner has amazing abilities considering the price. It has communicated with all OBD2 and Can Bus vehicles I have tried it on. I work at a dealership and use this scanner frequently. It is super fast at retrieving and clearing dtc's which is important when you work in the industry. It provides freeze frame for all codes that support freeze frame. It has many pids to display on the live data function, and the live data is relatively fast. I use this for everything from reading and clearing dtc's to making sure the ect pid stays steady when bleeding a cooling system to prevent overheating.

He said it would take certain amout of time to check every sensor related to the system that message was pointing to. It would be fairly expensive. I decided to purchase this product to see if I can narrow down to certain sensors to reduce the repair cost. This one does the same job that professional OBD does with the same message. But I got the three error codes this time. I searched the internet and found out the answer. It was just a loose pipe which triggered the sensor. I believe I have saved hundreds of dollars. The software came with the machine was totally useless. Don't even bother to install it. All you need is the internet access and the error code if the message is not clear enough to you. I am very happy with this wonderful tool.
92664,1,purchased this belt about 1 month ago for my 2001 Dodge Ram so far so good this belt replaced a dayco belt that was only 6 months old but made a terrible squealing noise
76975,1,"Dropped this in my motorcycle, and it runs great. I have a fuel injected bike with aftermarket exhaust and no Fuel Management system (Power Commander, or Juice Box) and the power band is smooth and responsive."
27764,1,"Unfortunately this is the second time I had to buy one of these. The product is solid and I've been very happy with it. I bought the deadbolt lock so that it wouldn't be stolen but it disappeared anyway. I think I may have lost it in a car wash. So, I ordered another one. It came but was missing the hardware. I was able to ship it back and get another one without any problems. It's a very solid steel (heavy) item and definitely worth the purchase!"
49006,1,bought this for a trip to florida driving from connecticut drove through 2 serious storms and not a hint of moisture inside this carrier is top notch and i would reccommend this with two thumbs up
98220,2,"I purchased this to use on my John Deer Rideing Lawn Mower, because the Tires have to be at the right air pressure or you do not get the pressure you need to blow the grass into the Rear Bagger. It Looks nice, I will give it that, However the one I received did not work. Every time I put it on a tire I was airing up, the pressure changed even if I diden't put any air in. I could not get it to work, and am sorry I bought it."
68244,0,the seat cover was the rite color but it was vary lite material for a truck seatcover thanks
129543,0,"I bought these for my 98 m3 4 door, they are working fine but I was disappointed with the price and fitment. There are two studs available for each of the roof rack mounts and these clips only use one of the studs. I bought my Yakima rack used, and it came off of a jetta with Q103 clips. The Q103 clips actually used both studs for each mount but the bend in the clip was slightly off and I want to have the correct fitment. It would have been nice if the Q18 clips used both available studs, and remember the package includes 2 clips, you will need 2 packages (4 clips) to fit your car."
184793,2,"This product did not fit my 97 Honda Civic EX. Asthough Amazon ""Make sure it fits your car"" feature said it did. Do not buy this product for a 97 Honda Civic EX. Waste of money."
15805,1,This is the perfect replacement for a worn out OEM part or to replace those Made in China junk replacements. I used this to replace a made in China part that failed after 1 month. Working flawlessly.
79556,2,You have to put it together with 3 screws onto the hitch insert. Then it wouldn't fit under the bumper on my F250. The top of the flag hits the bumper. Waste of money.
151527,0,It prevents the sun. The bandage fell apart from the shade after being pulled. But that doesn't matter. I can say it fits for my Camry L.
62032,1,"I recieved the gauge faster than I expected. It works great,looks good,no damage of any kind. I would reccomend this to anyone needing an air tank gauge."
17994,1,"Bought this product for my 1995 Mustang, that came without the original wheel locks. Product look good with great finish!"
52064,1,"This wax is expensive, but boy is it good. Also, it smells great. My black car is fairly new, and after using this wax, it has a very deep, glossy shine. This wax is strongly recommended for new cars. If your car has a lot of oxidation or scratches, you need a different product. You would need a light or moderate polishing compound, but these are not easy to apply. You could ruin your clearcoat or your base color if you are not careful"
27009,1,"I really like washable / re-usable filters on all my vehicles and power-sports equipment. They just make good sense, last forever, and cleaning is far more efficient than a paper filter.The local Honda dealer wanted as much for their paper filter as this K&N; costs, which made the switch to a permanent filter a no-brainer! Buy a new filter every 12K miles, or simply wash and re-charge this one every 50K!The filter was an exact fit, and even came with K&N; stickers to mount on the outside of the filter housing, as well as a WARNING sticker to alert dealers/maintenance personnel that they are NOT to remove / change / exchange this filter, EVER.After installing this filter, I noticed smoother acceleration, and more power as I reached speed. I took a 400 mile trip on my Sabre this past weekend, and reaped the benefit of gaining 2-3mpg as well! You can't go wrong with installing one of these on ANY vehicle!"
33615,0,I bought two of these and put them in 2 of our cars. One lasted only a month the other made it 3 months until it simply stopped heating (this was not a fuse problem). While it worked it was great - I had no problems with the straps. I will probably buy another next year but I wish these would last longer.
82836,2,"The replacement head was very easy to install, but the mirror itself doesn't provide anywhere near the same angle of view as the old one. It is going to take a lot of adjustment...until I find a better replacement. Also, it's made of plastic, not metal."
74544,0,"I was hoping for a book with a good sized trouble shooting section in it related the problem with my son's Suzuki GS450 but was disappointed in that regard. As far as the rest of the book goes, it's well detailed for most other purposes."
51770,1,"This stuff actually works pretty well. My car was starting to show a few nicks, door dings etc so I polished the whole thing with this stuff. When my husband came home from work and saw the difference he was amazed. It doesn't make every little scratch completely disappear but the overall appearance of the car was much better. For a few bucks it made a huge difference!"
45880,1,"Works as good as the original. I can never count on that from the aftermarket parts. One of the biggest lies, when the aftermarket say their parts &#34;Meet or exceeds OEM quality&#34;."
132634,0,"This stuff definitely works. It will not magically remove brake dust however. You still need to scrub with a brush, and have to be extremely careful not to get this acid on any unprotected part of your body, or painted car surfaces. Pretty serious acid burns appear shortly after exposure. Do not under any circumstances use this on clear-coated finishes; if not removed promptly, this may eat through the finish and ruin it.Personally, I resolved the brake dust issue by replacing my brake pads with ceramics. The dust is of very light color, and frequency of wheel cleaning is reduced drastically that way. It also cleans off way quicker just with soap, water and wheel brush. Overall, I don't even use Blue Coral or any other spray-on cleaner anymore - just grab your brush and a bucket of soap water and scrub (you won't get away from scrubbing anyway).Oh, one great application for this - stove top and kitchen counter cleaner. Just use thick kitchen gloves and enjoy squeaky clean degreasing action."
130594,1,This part worked perfectly and was in excellent condition. Shipped fast and will definitely order more in the future!
43489,1,"I bought a CP721 used 7 years ago. It has served very well. I am now having to buy anew one, because I dropped & broke my old $5.00 wrench. It's a strong wrench. I have broke off & stripped 3/8 bolts. 1.Chicago-Pneumatic 721 3/8"" HD Air Impact Wrench CP721"
94940,1,It is HEAVY if you have to hold it for long periods.It is however useful and functional for the money.You get only one cheap wool buffer pad. You need more and they can be hard to find.It has no carrying bag - only the box it comes in.It has a short cord - you need an extension to do anything.It is easy to adjust the speed with the convenient toggle.Not sure if it will work for the long haul yet but appears sturdy.
173313,1,I use this in my auto repair shop. Made of good material and well made. Worked just like it should.
83759,1,i oreded this item and it was shipped out the same day and shipped over 400 miles and got to me the next day. never happened before im gonna buy from them every chance i can.
122812,2,"I was really excited to have a great pair of wipers, but these left streaks after two weels of use. Major bummer."
3909,2,I saw the older good reviews so I decided to get this lock but sadly it doesn't work whenever I try to adjust it according to the size of my steering. It's so frustating!
165572,2,"For those of you who have had a nice sheepskin cover before, you WILL be disappointed. For those of you who bought this one your first time, you don't know what you are missing! There is nothing like a nice sheepskin car seat cover and from the pictures, this looked like one I had before. The second I opened the box I knew it was going back. I can't believe Brookstone would put thier name on such a poor quality item. I'm surprised it didn't cost more with all the labor it must have taken to sew all those itty bitty pieces together. This sheepskin is anything but plush and doesn't even feel real. Don't waste your time, you'll probably have to send it back, I know I am!"
36031,1,"Everytime I use this material I am pleasently surprised by several things.1. ease of installation, can't be beat(just peal and stick) simple to cut down and easy to apply.2. How much it really works to deaden really live panels and actually improve the accustics of say a door in a car.3. How much quieter the car is inside and how solid the door now sound when opening and closing.Great stuff highly I recamend this product.HushMat PF200B Ultra Black Foil Door Kit - 10 sheets"
52742,1,This unit has been a god send for diagnosing my multiple vehicles. It has been a valuable tool in saving me money on repairs as I do not need to go to a garage to have simple diagnostics done. The only complaint so far is getting help from the manufacturer as the supplied cd does not work with Apple computers and I cannot get a reply from Actron themselves. Beside that it was a very good investment.David Ward
118936,0,"This locking hitch pin seems to be secure once locked, but has several drawbacks.First, because it is longer than the average hitch pin (to accommodate the lock), it was very difficult to get it to fit on our Ford Explorer. We had to wiggle the lock in past the trailer electronics hookup (and a bolt), and eventually got it to connect. Normal hitch pins are no problem however, so most of this had to do with the odd length and layout of this locking pin. The weather cover will not go on at all, but in our case the bumper shields it from rain, so that works ok. Finally, once hooked on, the pin is a little bit loose, so it allows a small amount of wobble to whatever is connected.It will probably work well for its purpose, but I think I would research other options before settling on this one."
81655,1,"Had a smaller one that saved my bumper in a minor fender bender, the old one was destroyed so I opted for this larger one. Much better quality than I expected. Nice feature was the anti-rattle attachment that comes with it."
102823,0,The Quality of the material is AOK very nice. It wont Iron out flat & hug the body line no matter how tight I do the Strap that stretches across the Underside I suppose you could attach a couple small Velcro Pieces underneath but you would ruin the paint? If you plan on leaving the BRA on the truck then no problem but I only use my truck on long hauls othewise I leave the bra off so the paint doesent wear unevenly or leave a bra STRAP Tan line he he.Botton line if perfection is what you want take the thing into an uphulstory shop for 15 bucks they will make it hug the line better or so I was told.
121411,0,"Unfortunately this wouldn't fit my car. The lower radiator hose didn't have enough of a straight piece to install this properly. It would have been nice to have some kind of application chart to save me from paying return shipping. Also, it was extremely difficult to look up the diameter of the hose. They really need a chart or reference to insure proper fit."
14758,0,"It was an ok product, price, and arrived on time. It did fall short in one area that made it closer to cost effective to what I could have gotten locally, it did not incluse the oil and o-ring/gasket kit needed to install it. I had to spend about $20 more and buy both of them locally, which is why it only gets 3-star."
154929,1,"I installed this on a 2006 Honda Odyssey. I live by Murphy's Law, so I was thinking I would be in the camp that took two hours to install this thing, rather than the 20-minute camp. I'm happy to say that I had this hitch installed in 20 minutes. I'm thankful to those who said they didn't have to take off the muffler clamp, because if I hadn't read that, I think I wouldn't have tried hard enough, and I would have removed the muffler clamp. It would have made inserting the bolts easier, but I think it was a good trade-off to keep the muffler attached. I'm also glad I didn't have to tap out any holes, as there was no rust, and the bolts installed without any additional lubricant or materials.I installed the hitch, mounted the bike rack, and I was ready to go. This is a good, solid product and I am very happy with the purchase."
86918,1,"I have had this for about a month now and it is exactly as described. It really beads up water and does not allow it through the cover. I can't grade on how well it ""breathes"" but so far it seems as advertized. I have not encountered real heavy winds yet. It has handled some minor gusts. It comes with a rope to tie it down but I would suggest they supply some sort of ""tightening"" device. I have tied it down with two plastic clips that I had in the garage that will help untie it and not deal with any knotting... UPDATE-BEEN ABOUT A YEAR NOW AND IT IS NOT AS WATER PROOF AS WHEN NEW. IT WAS REALLY SOACKED AFTER SOME HEAVY RAIN. THE FRONT OF THE COVER HAS BLOWN OFF A COUPLE TIMES IN SOME MODERATE TO STRONG WINDS."
151794,2,"This blanket is a waste of money, this thing barely gets warm to the touch, some people rated this 4 stars i just dont see how.I bought this blanket thinking it would keep me warm in my car at work when i'm on lunch and don't wanna run the car engine to keep warm. plugged it in to socket and the light on the cord came on. while the car just got colder and colder i waited and waited and after 20 minutes and this thing was barely warm to the touch it was as warm as my hand was ,, there was no noticeable increase in warmth in the car either . wow what a gimmick, i should have known it was too good to be true. dont waste your money, will not keep u warm. It was just annoying having this thing covering me totally useless."
45126,1,"This grease gun holder not only keeps your gun handy, but because the gun is stored vertically it also prevents that greasy, oily mess you get when it's laid on a shelf."
67849,1,"I purchased this item to provide temporary protection (from my dog) for my 1999 SL500 Mercedes-Benz. The cover stretches over my seats just fine, but is not suitable for permanent, human-occupation use, since my car has seat belts built into the seats, and no accommodation for the seatbelt is provided in this unit's design.Also, the listing does not mention the product's color. It's ash grey, for the record, not beige, as I had hoped. Also, the listing does not say that two covers are included in the package. This was a bonus I wasn't expecting.For the money, this is very hard to beat!"
164236,2,"I bought this 1.5 years ago and used it on occasion. Recently, I noticed that the LED display started acting finicky and would not always display. The problem quickly worsened to the point that now the LED will not display at all (no matter what) even though the unit still provides power as before, and even though it appears that the unit still can charged with the included A/C adapter.The lack of a working LED display is very annoying because I will no longer get feedback as to how much power is left in the battery, or how many watts are being consumed when using the unit. Since the warranty only lasts 6 months, I'm out of luck.I tried temporarily disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it to see if that would ""reboot"" the display but it did not help. I also tried removing the battery altogether and opening up the plastic case of the unit to see if there were any loose connections inside that would cause the display to fail but did not find any. Some of the connections are in compartments that didn't seem accessible. Looks like I'll just have to live with the lack of the LED display.The only LED that still works is the one that lights up the power switch of the inverter.Another complaint I have is that the clear plastic covers that protect the inverter and 12/V stockets are awkward to flip open because it is hard to get a good grip with my fingertips.UPDATE: The LED seems to be working again. I have no explanation as to why it wasn't working before or why it is working again. Looks like the LED problem is intermittant. Battery was certainly sufficiently charged the whole time."
18316,0,"I ordered my Mityvac on 4-10-09, and received it on 4-14-09. Installation was a breeze, and it worked like a charm, that is until i had to empty the canister to make more room (my car, which is an Audi, holds a little over 9.5 qts of oil). I removed the plastic tube adapter that held the main evacuator tube in place so that i could open up the pour spout. Once the canister was emptied, i returned the the plastic tube adapter and for some odd reason, it was extremely loose, to the point where i had to put rubber bands to close the seal.Also, i had to switch a rubber tube adapter (comes with 3) around for it to work the 2nd time since the 1st one that i used became loose as well and left an air leak between the dip stick tube and the main evacutation tube.Overall it took about an hour for the process. Yes, it was less messy, and yes, it did remove 99% of the oil, but the fact that i had to Macgyver certain parts of the product for it to work again is the reason i gave it 3 stars.I was planning on returning the product to Amazon but decided not to since i am not in the mood to repackage everything. Not to say that i am not satisfied, it was just more work than i expected, plus the fact that i had to MAKE it work the 2nd time by using rubber bands."
88842,1,"When I received these sunshades, I found out that they are recommended for vans and vehicles with large windshields. Happily, however, I found they fit my Nissan Altima perfectly. The shields are in 2 pieces, so there is a large overlap in the middle, but it works very well."

29766,1,These iridium spark plugs really makes a difference.But my engine gets kind of irregular motion while it's still cold. Not really a problem cause after 15min you are already using all that extra iridium goodness!
41979,1,These are great replacement blades! Containing the silicone it leave a spot-free and water beeding effect. Even when driving through the heaviest rains.I put these bades on my 2005 Honda Accord and they last about a year in Ohio. When you install them be sure to follow the instructions from the manufacturer. Clean your windsheild and run them dry for about 5 min to put the first coating of silicone on the windsheild
8643,0,"in their Vintage Glaze description they say: ""Vintage contains 61 percent Brazilian #1 White Carnauba by volume, the highest in any product designed to protect automotive finishes."" ... highest? but still as in less than their own Royal Glaze which they claim is 70%?in addition the Swissvax Paul Dalton Crystal Rock contains 76%! ... all VERY confusing (or very not correct?)"

10575,0,"This product is sturdy and provides an overall good service.One drawback is that it is somewhat a hassle to remove the dividers in order to have the walls collapse when you need to place larger objects in the trunk, such as a bicycle, luggage, etc.The most important downfall of this product, however, is that it smells VERY bad!!! I had it outside for more than 1 week and sprayed it several times with deodorizers before placing it in the trunk. On hot days, I can still smell it when I get in the car... yuck!"
100598,1,Time to replace the air filter for my cycle so I decided to try online instead of dealer and picked this high performance air filter. Shipment was very fast. Very easy to install. I would recommend this product and this Seller.
74878,1,"If you're looking for a small trash bag for the car, this is it! Claims to be water resistant, but I prefer to put a regular grocery bag inside so it's easier to empty the trash. Hooks onto the back of the front seat, and very easy to reach over, open, toss, and close, all with one hand!"
94026,1,"Need to trust that they did a good job. Once lines were secured at each end, with the keyed pieces lined up, the torque on the line put it into the correct shape. I would definitely recommend these lines."
12158,1,Have a vehicle that is driven infrequently and the battery kept going dead. Did not want to disconnect the battery since the car has all the electronic equipment plus the car alarm. Did some research and asked some mechanic friends about a 'trickle charger' and they recommended the 'Battery Tender'. It was extremely easy to hook up and I've not had a dead battery since installation.
21855,0,This is a very good product and performed as advertised once it was installed. The written instructions are lacking in specificity and I was forced to call customer support to obtain clarification. On the plus side customer support was very responsive.

They installed very easily, so easy in fact, I had my 11 year old son help install them...I had to loosen and tighten the bolts of coarse :) Thanks!"
12363,1,"I bought this for my motorcycle while garaged over the winter and I love it easy to setup, convenient, nice features easy to install pig tails for quick connect works great."
62849,2,I can not believe I spent this much for some air freshener. It smells good and looks Rad. but not 9 dollars rad.

103444,1,"My wife is 5 feet nothing and is always complaining about the counter height being to tall for her. Not wanting to spend $20K to redo the kitchen, I purchased her this folding step. I have to say, it solved my dilemma. It is well made and seems very sturdy. She likes it that she can quickly fold it up and put it away when not in use. I like it that I don't have to hear how she can't reach anything. Highly recommended if you have the same problem!"

The tones are not as high in pitch and the speed that the horns switch from one to the next doesn't seem to be as quick. Oh well, I DO like the way it sounds and definitely does the job. You have to be sort of a good do-it-yourselfer as it does not come with the button and electrical wiring needed for a proper add-on install. If you are just replacing your existing horn, then this works..."
125766,1,Very sturdy and easy enough to use. I use for salt water so you have to lube it up from time to time. Otherwise it works as stated.
71399,1,"This clay bar system by mother's worked absolute wonders on my 2001 bmw 540i. The paint was not in a bad condition, but had that rough feel that comes with an older paint job. After using the clay bar, the paint feels just like new! Although this product does restore the feel to that out of the dealership feel, you should still follow up with a nice coat of wax to protect and make that new feel last.Buy this product, you will not regret it! I promise!"
182411,1,"Super easy plug and play. Figure out best way to route harness first then go for it. Pretty self explanatory as plugs work perfectly. You will have to drill a hole for the ground lug but metal was thin so not a problem. I bought a nice used boat trailer and when i plugged it in the lights failed to work. The guy insisted that the trailer lights worked so it ""must be your truck lights"". Since it was my first time trying the harness I wondered if it was defective. So I took the trailer home and troubleshot. It was a broken ground wire on the trailer that took me five minutes to fix. Harness was perfect!"

128514,2,"Don't Buy this, Looks nothing like the picture. Seriously!! the box came with two pieces of aluminum. Nothing for around the ford logo and nothing for the side vents, plus you would still see the plastic underneath if there was enough aluminum to cover the whole grille. Complete rip off! Find an auto shop in your area that does custom work. Have them install a grille. It's not that expensive. I got mine done at a place called Hunters in Nashville for $150, and it looks better than the picture."

147052,0,"The bag is great, very roomy and comfortable, just wish that the strap was adjustable. Also, I didn't know that it had a design on the backside and inside, I would have chosen another color if I had known.

8422,0,"I like the fit of the floor mats but wish they would cover the dead pedal side too. The mats aren't as easy to clean, it's not really just ""hose it off"" as I thought. You will want a brush to stir up the dirt then it will come off ok."
65873,0,"The duster part is great, but the handle is not so great. It really collects the dust, so no complaints about how well it cleans our hardwood floors. The sweeper head is a pretty good size -- small enough to fit around furniture, but large enough for open areas; however it is too bulky to use on our stairs. It's a little heavy, but not enough to be a nuisance or cause any problems. The handle is high-quality aluminum, both light and sturdy. It is adjustable for length, but even fully extended it is a little bit too short for ultimate comfort, but definitely still easily usable -- I'm 6'1"". My real complaint is that when I maneuver the duster around furniture, the handle either unscrews itself from the head or the twist-lock unlocks and the handle collapses. Sometimes both happen at once. These problems are not just a once-in-a-while occurrence, I have problems pretty much every time I sweep. And that keeps me from really loving this duster."
109138,0,"The Price was fine and that was important as we were just replacing the blades on an old junker we keep around but I did find a cheaper blade at Menards (under two bucks with rebate) that worked fine. As always, amazon was great to work with in returning the product."
104742,1,"2006 Lexus IS350I was kind of hesitant to make such an upgrade since the car is quick and fast enough as it is. But I took the plunge and purchased the product and installed it myself. The instructions are pretty clear and the installation process should take about 1 hour or less as long as you have all the tools. Pretty easy, actually.As far as the performance of the product and what it does to your car, if you're not familiar with upgrading to higher performance parts in place of the stock equipment, you have to understand that it will chance the standard dynamic of your car from what the manufacturer of your vehicle intended. That being said, although the performance gain is rather minimal in terms of numbers (about 2-5% RW HP gain) the feel and response is significant.At tip in from about 2000 to 3500 RPM you will hear a louder snarl from under the hood. As with the stock intake you barely notice anything, the K&N; adds a tone that most enthusiasts will enjoy. On the other hand, once you stomp it it and let your tach run past 4000 to redline the difference is obvious. I rarely stomp the pedal but when you do the sound is extremely aggressive and, in my opinion as far as I'm concerned, the response is excellent.Once you accept the fact that this upgrade is not 100% inconspicuous you will love the change. Only thing I regret is not doing this sooner. Also, I live in an area that rains a lot and is rather dusty and windy all times of the year (Houston) I'd recommend the Filter bag that goes on the outside of the ram air filter."
46024,2,"I got a few years of service out of this charger. The red ""check"" light is now on and won't go off. It just won't charge at all- any battery, any outlet. I never liked it anyway because I always had to unplug it and restart it before it would charge a battery enough to turn a starter. It would charge up to 70% or so, then the fan would just run for hours. You could tell it wasn't charging because it makes a distinct sound when it is. If you unplugged it and plugged it back in, the charge % would drop way down and it would resume charging. I've seen 2 fairly new of these models now get stuck where the red ""check"" light comes on and they die. I will never buy another Schumacher product again."
13346,1,Bought 4 of these for my seasonal camper. They work great. Easy to crank up or down. Very stable. Should last a very long time. Snafu with shipping was dealt with promptly and professionally by Amazon. Very satisfied.

113314,0,"Before I write my review, observations and lessons learned, I need to disclose that I used this product on a motorcycle trailer, not a truck bed.(1) I quickly found that one should not use a plastic roller pan with this coating. Why? The Dupli-Color Coating degraded and ate completely through the bottom of the plastic roller pan. Luckily I had a metal pan nearby.(2) The coating is thick and difficult to work with. Even with a brush it was hard to cut-in hard to reach places, crevices and indentations. I thought about thinning the coating, however I didn't see anything in the documentation stating you could or could not do that. I'm sure the thickness/viscosity of the product is how it is intended to be.(3) It is also very, very temperature sensitive. It emulsified, clumped and crusted-over very quickly during summertime heat (even in the shade). I'd recommend to others a spring or fall application of the coating.(4) I used a roller - with mixed results. The texture of the finished coat was far from uniform. I used both the recommended ""texture"" roller cover and a standard roller cover with a medium nap. Neither out-performed the other; in fact, in some areas the texture cover did better but in other areas the standard nap roller yielded a better result (better is defined as both ""a more uniform thickness"" and ""a uniform visual appearance"").(5) I like the bed liner-like texture of the coating on the metal-grid section of my motorcycle trailer deck. It should provide more stable footing when wet. However, it was hard to apply to the grid-deck. I became so frustrated that midway through this part of the job, I spray-painted the steel grid with Rustoleum to ensure everything was covered. Then I went back to the Dupli-Color Coating (I used two types of roller covers, sprayed Rustoleum, then I went back to the Dupli-Color Coating via a paint brush, then I rolled one more time with the texture roller cover).(6) I would like to see how a spray gun performs with this product. I'm far from an expert, but I assume a top-grade spray gun may be needed. Due to the viscosity of the product I assume it would need to be thinned if one used an inferior or cheap spray gun.In summary, my review title says it all. It is what it is: a Do-It-Yourself substitute for a professional job. Applying via a roller, no one should kid themselves that their finished product will look anything close to a professional ""spay-in bed liner"". Given my results, I would never apply this to my truck bed! But for what I used it for - to protect a 2003 motorcycle trailer - it served its purpose. If the Dupli-Color Coating proves to be durable, the effort & expense will have been worth it. Only time will tell."
147070,1,"I've used this for my last few oil changes on my '04 Colorado, and I've noticed that my engine feels decidedly more smooth as it runs, and when I drain the oil it's color has not degraded nearly as much as other oils I've used."

24200,0,"Pros: Looks great, sounds great, resonated tip quiets down exhaust a surprising amountCons: Sizing is ridiculous, I have 2.3 OD pipes and I could only clamp on 2 of 3 mounting screws. Also the mounting system is not well executed. Manufacturer should have nuts on the backside to allow the bolts to be torqued down (right now it is just the body of the tip which is threaded for the bolts). If you even apply the slightest force the bolts are so soft the thread strips. This is an exhaust, it rattles, it needs a mounting solution that can bolt to the pipe tightly... Even if the bolting system did allow the appropriate tightness, the way the bolts stick out looks ridiculous from the back, totally negating any improvements in looks that the tip might bring. Fine if your car is so low you cant see under the bumper. But, any vehicle with the muffler can itself visible (most sedans, wagons, and SUV's), you sure can see the mounting bolts with 3 frankenstein lugs sticking out.I'll see if I can get this welded on but until then it's a mixed review product for me."
146619,0,"This item is just a cheap overlay (too small for a license plate to fit inside), a substitute, to take the place of the dealer's plastic frames. As such, it is just a dress-up item, slim enough not to cover up the state name or motto and the holes line up ok. It doesn't come with screws or caps. I believe it will be a temporary item, as I don't have too much hope it will last long before it starts to corrode. I'll be very surprised if it makes the winter up here in the Northeast. For now it's an improvement, as most people don't take a close look at your plates anyway, especially without a dealer's name on the frame. Too cheap to return, but now with hindsight as to their construction, I would have never bought them in the first place and gone for something more substantial.I will try to remember to update this review, as to its longevity, in a year or sooner."
135071,2,"I purchased this horn, had it professionally installed, and it worked great for 4 months! Then it started to not work when it got hot. Finally, 2 months later it died. I had the wiring checked and there is nothing wrong with the installation. The device just does not hold up. I called Amazon and they were no help on getting me a replacement. Finally they gave me the website for the manufacturer. I left them some feedback and 2 weeks later have not heard from them. I told Amazon not to sell this product any more. If you are reading this, they still are. I strongly suggest you NOT purchase it!"
97411,2,"I have no idea how they market these bulbs as having any component of ""blue"" to the light. I bought these to better match my HID low beams, in a word they don't. The stock HIDs which are quoted to be 4300K, they are white maybe a little blue. These PIAA bulbs are if anything yellow, there is no way anybody could say these are at all blue (the back of the box calls out the blue component) with a strait face and they aren't even really white. There is no color difference between these and the bulbs that I replaced them with. That is a shame as that is the only reason somebody would buy a bulb like this. The worst part is they even show on the side of the box what their 4000K bulbs should look like, I can hold the box up next to the white wall the lights are shining on and it isn't even close.On the plus side they are not dim, but the bulbs I pulled out weren't either and they cost half the price."
89463,0,"These bulbs are not very bright, but they sure are white. They actually have a blue-ish tint to it as well. I like the color anyhow. The price paid is a tad too expensive. These bulbs go with my c240 benz in the peanut style headlights. they don't look too bad. Too bad my headlamps are yellow-ish, even though I bought the PIAA xtreme white cool blue............. and these wedge bulbs are white..."
65125,1,"The emergency hammer is 16cm long and 9.5cm wide from hammer tip to tip. Handle is made of textured black plastic that is easy to grip. There is a recessed blade in the handle for cutting yourself out of a seatbelt. The orange triangular reflector at the top is just a little mylar sticker (kinda pointless,really). The whole thing snaps into a plastic holder that can be screwed to a rigid surface. I like this hammer because it is black and blends seamlessly with my vehicle interior (no blaze orange for me, thank you). Also; it has two impact heads, where others have only one."
148512,0,"well, after 2 months of using them, one of the bulbs failed. The darn thing didnt even really blow out or burned out. Upon closer inspection, the connection from the bulb's base to the filament coil snapped and fell apart. Normally a burned bulb would have the filament snap or break.. not my case.Would I buy again? Probably not, especially if there's 2500k HID kits to get."
120468,1,"I don't know how I managed so long without this tool. I used to use picks and patience to carefully remove crankshaft and camshaft seals when replacing them on Honda's and Toyotas during timing belt service.This tool is easy to use and gets the job done so fast now.I did have a slight problem with mine the second time I used it....the handle bent. I was removing the camshaft seal on a 97 Corolla 1.8 and noticed the handle became bent after using it at this location.Not sure what caused it to bend as I did not apply very much pressure to the handle and the seal easily popped out.I'm still able to use it with the bent handle. Maybe mine just had some poorer grade steel used for the handle?Still, I recommend this tool to anyone what wants to remove seals in a timely manner without causing damage to the shaft surface."
96753,1,Got this for my 98 Honda Prelude along with the Denso 234-4621. One of them is intended for the front O2 sensor and the other is the rear. Its essentially the same thing but one of them has a longer cable.

Bought these to change a 97 camry xle v6 brakes because it was warped really bad and couldnt stand it. got new brake pads (lifetime warranty at autozone =D)even though my current pads where almost brand new.Most rotors if not all rotors are made in china now so there isnt much luck in finding some made in america.

I am very dissapointed that the ordering options did not ask as to whether or not the vehicle had a sun roof as this item will not fit if you do. Now I am stuck with a $450 investment for an item that we con not use and my son with a dissapointing Christmas present."

2962,0,"Warning, this is not a quick replacement.The pod is straight out of the pathetic mold with all the burrs. Worst is the screw holes, you need to put a tap through so the bolt can go in! You'll get real disgusted comparing to the old pod you are removing.The injector connector mates with the new wire harness. Hmm, if we had that, we probably wouldn't need this pod! Holley Tech at least was able to tell us we need to cut and splice the wires to the old harness. Match the red wires to the black wires with white writing. Course this means a trip to the store for the wire connectors.Keep in mind too the new injectors you need to set your gas pressure at 20psi where the old injectors was 15psi. course we haven't got that far to do that."

95263,0,"Purchased this over two months back. I was excited to install this in my car and finally did so along with a Load equalizer (bought it from autozone in the bulb aisle) to keep the normal blinking speed. The bulb is not as bright as i believed it to be. But for the price, its a nicer alternative. The LEDs have a long way to go to be commercially sold for a cheaper price. But for now, we are forced to settle for these regular LEDs."

One size fits all and it fits his 7 3/8 head just fine.Even though it is thin, he claims it is perfect for keeping his face warm. Vision out of it is fine. The only issue I have with it is when I call him on his cell to tell him to get the heck off the slopes and get home - he claims he can't talk to me as there is no mouth opening. Yea right! Thank goodness for text messaging!"
131970,0,"While the shield looks great, it is very light compared to my other ""sport"" shield. Maybe half or less in weight probably due to the fact that it's acrylic and not polycarbonate. The mounting system is not solidly lockable, at least not on my bike and speeds over 50mph do in fact cause it to creep lower over time. Upshot is you can pretty much just push it back at a stop but that will inevitably lead to further loosening.Looks are the big plus here. Have had numerous positive comments on it from others. I have it mounted to a 2009 TU250X which is one of the only UJM style bikes currently in production and it looks like it belongs on it.Additional comment: Found that the headlight bolts were not as tight as they could have been. This might have contributed to the creeping problem. Will assess and possibly revise rating given future results."
147943,0,They were great. reduce sagging by a lot. stiffen the ride a lot too. loved them. then they got older and was rubbing the coating off the springs. then they started squeaking loud. The worst part was they don't stay in place. they bunch up toward the rear of the spring. i feel that might not me good to have all the stiffener on only one side. took them off after dealing with them for a year.
162972,1,"From the time I got the package to complete installtion was less than 20 minutes. I am very impressed by the design using attach points that pickup up both the existing frame and the Toyota stock bumper reinforcement. The only glitch is the bolts going through the Toyota bumper are a tad too long and can interfere with the receiver hitch pin. Shortening the protruding ends of the bolts after torquing is an easy fix.The reason I bought the hitch was the review picture posted which showed the attachments to the bumper, which don't show in the ""stock"" photo."
173849,1,"fast shipment , plugged right in and works too. Note you need trailer tow package for this to plug in or you will have to splice wires."

94370,1,"I have these horns and love them. Install was easy, but time consuming. I suggest mounting them behind the grill like the other reviewer. I've had them installed for a few months. I haven't noticed them getting dirty, and I enjoy driving on dirt.The hella relay is strongly recommended. Without the relay, the horns do not get enough power and will not get to 118db. Also, if the horns are not grounded correctly (use the battery ground), they will not get to 118db."

I was worried that if a hand cleaner/degreaser worked really well to remove the grime,oil,grease, etc... that it would it would irritate my skin but it didn't. Not only were my hands nice and clean but smells like oranges! My only complaint I would have was the 7.5 oz it comes in was not enough, they should ship this stuff in drums! Very happy and would buy this hand cleaner again with no hesitation!"

87132,1,"I got these delivered yesterday and put them in overnight and when I went to my car late this afternoon after a day of full bright sun, it was pretty cool inside the car! These shields really work to reflect the light and heat coming into the car...they put the little ones that fold into discs to shame. I bought 2...one for the front and one for the back windows. The front fits perfectly and snugly...it's a little cumbersome to get it into place, but it's not a big deal and I'd rather have a shield that fits so well. The one for the back is a bit big, but better too big than not large enough. Great product!"

73097,1,"Another good experience through Amazon. Ordered these lights based on existing reviews. They shipped in 5 days-with SuperSaver no less! It took several hours to install on our Suburban, but I'm picky about stuff. I took the grille, bumper and lower valance off in order to mount them securely and as close to factory appearance as possible. The instructions were very easy to understand. I installed the set per the instructions with the exception of the recommendation of other reviewers regarding the black deflectors inside-I removed them as well. In hindsight I would probably just wire them to the low beam headlights rather than using the included wire harness. The only reason for the harness is if you want an on/off switch. Don't know about longevity yet but I'm optimistic. I will probably buy another set for my other vehicle."
112004,1,"I have used Bendix MKD-series brake pads since 1990 when I managed two automotive repair shops. They have proved time and time again to be an excellent product. The MKD376 pads are no different. I installed them on freshly resurfaced rotors, and they stopped perfectly from the first time I pressed the brake pedal. The pads felt like they ""seated"" to the rotors very quickly, and they don't shutter or make any noise. I highly recommend Bendix pads. Finally, the price could not be beat--$38--rock bottom. That's cheaper than I used to pay wholesale. Just remember, when comparing prices, match apples to apples. Happy stopping!"
156039,1,"Have not used this yet since I am waiting for the 1-1/2"" socket to fit the nut. They also recommend over 200 pounds of torque. Fortunately, I have a breaker bar 24"" long. It does look and feel like a nice solid ball, so no complaints from me.Also plan on a 1 5/8"" open end wrench or crescent wrench to go around the flat surface on the ball side. I could not tighten without the ball spinning. You need to hold both sides to tighten sufficiently."
6560,0,Good product but I would have rated it higher if I had known it wasn't coming with the Filter Strainer that I need for it. It says must be used with new strainer not included or it voids the warranty.

171678,0,the installation instructions are hard to understand. i have been working on automobiles for 30 + years and i still do not have the install figured out. i did get the day time running lamps to work but the auto head lights are still not working. a good foot note for the instructions would be to tell people if you do not want a particular option do not use ignition wire connection or donot use orange wire if you do not want to hook to security system.

BUT - it only lasted me one season, and was completely dead (light came on when plugged in but never warmed up at all) this fall after closet storage for the summer. I just boughtWagan IN9738-5 12V Heated Seat Cushion with Enhanced Durability and 3-Way Temperature Control Switchwhich seems to have durable material, much better straps, and has a 3-way switch. We'll see about the durability. I looked, and of course these only have a one-year warranty. Despite that, it's worth $20 every winter to keep my butt warm even if I have to keep buying new ones!"
172113,2,The hoses have different treads than the part that attaches to engine block and to filter. I used a sealant to stop leaks. Three months later one of the hoses burst. Bad product. Very low quality.
112766,1,"The rack is well built and very solid. It was very easy to assemble and is stable with a heavy load on it. As others have said in their reviews, the packaging is absolutely horrible. The box arrived with holes all over the place. I wouldn't have been surprised if the hardware had fallen out but I was fortunate to find it intact. Due to the rotten packaging the rack is scuffed in a number of places. Sure, a bit of Rustoleum spray paint will take care of it, but why should we have the bear the expense of fixing up a brand new item? Valley should get their act together."
65006,1,I bought this product to secure the front sights on my .22LR target pistols. The sights regularly loosened while shooting due to the recoil. I put a little bit on the attachment screw and the sights now remain secure. For this application I recommend this product.

Not a good choice."

91309,0,"This meter seems to be reasonably solid and accurate, but it fails to meet my needs. I already have several DMM, I didn't need another one. I DID however need a good multimeter with a USB interface and I bought this one solely for that reason. Actually, my meter is a Sinometer VA18B, but it appears to be identical to this one.The problem is more with the limited software than with any hardware issues. The optical USB connection works fine WHEN it can be connected. However, using several bench and laptop computers (all running XP), I find it can take 5-10 min to make a connection, and sometimes it never succeeds. The included CD provides a driver and a simple interface program with very limited options although it does allow one to save the data to an Excel file. The meter provides a dropdown list of virtual com ports for connection, but the list is often corrupted and you cannot enter a port directly. It usually takes a lot of playing around with the computer port settings and the meter selection to connect. Ultimately, I find it frustrating.If this meter provided a solid means of computer interface and provided a DLL or other means to allow connecting to a custom program it could be a winner. As it is, however, I find it has limited utility."
51490,1,This item has worked great and installed with ease. The only thing I didn't care for was the obnoxious over sized box it was shipped in that got beat up and that the rotor came with rust spots on it. I know it will rust when on the car but when you buy something new you hope it doesn't arrive like that.

Not worth it.These were available on line only. But arrived with a display hanger. I think I got substituted with generic.

136441,0,"This item had to be partially disassembled to be assembled due to a manufacturing error resulting in insufficient clearances. The pivot bolts supplied are too short for the intended assembly and the instruction manual is both incomplete and difficult to read.On the plus side, it arrived promptly without damage. While the item will do the intended job, I'm hard-pressed to give this a positive recommendation."
69932,2,"One of the other reviews was correct. This is NOT the correct bracket for my 2012 Chevy Malibu passenger wiper. I ordered Bosch Evolution per the Amazon application guide for the driver/passenger wipers. The Bosch Evolution 4842 is the correct driver side wiper, but this Bosch Evolution 4840 is NOT a GM application wiper. This wiper has a Valeo top lock connector that I think is an Audi/BMW application. The new GM wipers use just a top lock connector. They look very similar, and the wiper will actually start to slide into the wiper arm, but it won't go on all the way. Only then will you see that it's not the right connector and can't go on all the way because the plastic housing for the swivel is in the way. I had to take the wiper off the driver side to compare the two to figure out why it didn't work. Then it's obvious they don't even resemble each other. The only thing in common is the wide mount that just happens to be able to fit part way onto the wiper arm. Here's the Bosch url for the wiper arm types - examine the top lock and Valeo mounts - you'll see they're very similar, but incompatible: [...]"

Of course, I had to tell him that my front tire keeps getting low and I'm tired of stopping at a service station to get air.So, that was one year ago. Since then, I've seen HIM pull this out for other things at least once or twice a month. He's used it on a wheelbarrow wheel, pool floats, bicycle tires, you name it. For something that we did not need (according to him,) we (he) sure is getting a lot of use out of it!"

108523,0,does not look like the picture. a lil bit darker and it barely lights up. no instructions and the screws to hold it to the stick dnt stay in. after like a day of shifting they will wiggle lose and the knob will start to wiggle around which gets annoying. try finding something at ur local car places or something that matches your car right. i have a celica-gts 2000 but it looks good
156116,1,"Like all the other reviews, I noticed how highly rated CRC's product was. I have an old Ford Tempo (V6) and have had to deal with two repairs concerning the mass air flow sensor. The repairs would be easily $150 or more to fix just the jerky feeling I get when slightly pressing the gas between 10-20mph and 30-40mph--not smooth at all and annoying like heck. Long story short, I watched the CRC's youtube video about this and a couple others. Followed the instructions. I didn't even remove the housing electrical plug on top of the sensor because it's held down with wierd T-20 Torx heads. My T-20 bit didn't even work on it. So I just sprayed through the mesh into the little hole containing the wires. Cleaned up everything and inserted/plugged it back in.. took my car for a test drive and seriously NO HICCUPS. Drove great. I was stunned and incredibly happy. Going up to college, I'll be carrying 1 or 2 of these in my trunk whenever I change my air filter or it's feeling bogged down. Thanks CRC!"

799,0,"It is OK, it will only slow a thief down. I had to have a welding shop modify the part that the lug nut from the wheel so a thief could not get a wrench on it. The way it was manufactured anyone could get a wrench on the lug nut and if you get the lug nut off the lock is useless. The orange part that wraps around your trailer tire also catches rain water and when you remove the wheel lock if you are not careful you will get rust water on you and all over the paved surface the trailer is parked. i use other methods of keeping my trailer secure, this is just one method to slow a thief down but i recommed if you purchase it to have a welder make a wrap so to speak around the lug nut so you can get the lock off when you need too. if the thief has a battery power grinder they can remove this lock in a few seconds, however it will require the thief to make noise."
148818,0,"These are a universal fit item that Amazon indicated would fit my 2003 Lexus IS300. They are too big. That isn't an outrageous shock for a one size fits all product, but it is a disappointment.You will also need to trim them to size yourself. I didn't realize that when I made the purchase."
154824,2,"Last Fall, after reading the claims of this spark plug, I purchased one for use in my old McCulloch chain saw. It did seem to improve the overall performance of the chain saw during my fire wood cutting (I cut 15-20 cord a year for heating). This Spring, after routine maintenance, I cranked up the saw to block up a few small trees. Everything went fine for the first tank of gas. During the second tank the saw stopped running accompanied by a clanging noise in the cylinder. Then the saw froze right up. Upon disassembling the cylinder I located the problem. The ""horse shoe"" ring that goes around the electrode broke loose from the body of the spark plug and became embedded in the top of the cylinder. The damage to the piston and cylinder have rendered this engine useless. In 40 years of working on engines I have never seen a standard spark plug break down like this one did. I can only assume that it is a design flaw, poor materials, or poor quality control that caused this to happen. The life time warranty is limited to the replacement of the failed plug. So if you value your equipment I would think twice before purchasing one of these plugs."
179457,0,It's been 2 years from the time I put them up and I was looking at buying another set to give me more power until yesterday when I was up on my roof cleaning them I found a crack on one of the panels frames. After 2 years they should have not cracked. they should have used a stronger material when making these. Also every screw they gave rusted really badly. If I didn't pay 1 seventy 9 on flebay after shiping I would have been more upset. This system is not worth the amazon price. Should have known being it's made in CHINA
102426,2,Made in China junk will not stay in at all must hold in to heat up. Not worth my time or money to return.

162874,1,Installed the K&N filter in my 2011 Miata. A good fit. I have used the K&N filter many times. I have it in all my vehicles now..4 autos and 2 motorcycles. Like the fit and the ease of cleaning and reusing. A good price from Amazon. Amazon had the fitment updated for the 2011 model before K&N did.
91207,0,"I bought this hump matt to cover many years of drink stains on the carpet. I have another brand of rubber floor matt, and was looking for something more carpet-based for the hump. I also liked the small ridges which prevent things from sliding off the hump. When the product arrived, there was a black stain in the center of it, slightly smaller than a dime. Considering I was buying this to cover up stains - I was disappointed to receive the matt pre-stained! Unfortunately the trouble of returning it and waiting for a new one caused me to just accept it and move on.My second issue is that when you're attempting to use this matt as a stand-alone item (meaning not in conjunction with the same brand left and right side matts), it doesn't line up well. Specifically, the sides of the matt flare outward on the end closest to the engine. Ideally, the design would have allowed the matt to hug the exact shape of the hump.Overall, it's made of high quality, and I don't really regret my purchase - but I was slightly disappointed by the stain and the fit."
88390,2,"The pump that comes with the unit is awful. The noise coming from it can be heard over the engine and the radio at a low volume, not to mention the static that it sends through the speakers. The strainer, meter, and the gasket are all fine. Anyone looking at this unit should buy the sending unit by itself and get a good aftermarket pump."
9781,0,"I purchased these Bosch Icon wipers on October 2009. I based my purchase on Bosch's claim that these blades are long lasting, quiet, and had uniform pressure across the blade that resulted in reduced blade lift off. After a year, my blades exhibit none of these characteristics.I replaced both wipers at the same time and they deteriorated in the same fashion and time frame.Fall 2009, the wipers worked.By spring 2010, wipers were smearing and streaking.By winter 2010, wipers had deteriorated and large parts of the wipers were not making contact with the windshield and they stutter, skip, and squeak.I'm not very pleased with Bosch. Premium wipers should not be smearing and streaking after one winter and their life expectancy should be greater than one year.Purchasing or repurchasing these blades every year does not make sense to me and does not reconcile with my expectation that premium wipers should last at least 2 years.Thus, I'm switching to another brand and I'm going back to the oem wipers if my new ones do not work out."
106609,0,"Nothing much to say about the battery, it a typical Lead Acid battery. Filling it isn't real simple. This DOES NOT come with the acid. You will need to go to the local autoparts store for that. The battery was packed well."

186247,0,"Sturdy/. put together well, has rotating nozzle head, but the significant drawback on this model is that it doesn't keep the pressure reading after it is removed from the tire. most do and have a 'reset button' to click after. This means to read your pressure you have to be down at tire level and read it while keeping the seal on the nozzle.. not the end of the world but certainly less convenient than could be. I would love this gauge if it had the clicker as everything else is great!"
89876,0,"I was not happy that he fairy was blue on the sides instead of purple like the matching seat cover. The material feels cheap for the cost of this whole set but I have enjoyed it. I rather enjoy the black material feel rather than the velvety grey but that's just me. It was a challenge to get on the wheel as it doesn't stretch much. I've had it 3 months and it hasn't faded in the sun yet. Not a bad buy, but it feels cheaply made."
49866,1,"It fits and works like it should, I purchased in-channel ones previously, but they quickly broke, so I went with this.. and they work fine."
75236,1,This seat is great. Just went 300 miles this weekend and never felt sore. The back support feels good. My girlfriend also liked the passenger seat. Note that this seat sits two inches higher then the stock seat. I had to add handlebar risers (BA-7410-U) to bring the bars back to the proper height. I now need to raise my windshield to eliminate the turbulance created by sitting higher.
173233,1,What can I say? Klasse Sealant is the standard for making your car look brand new. The key is to apply it thinly so it is easy to buff off.
132479,0,"Good points. June 8,2000 Installation on a 2000 4door blazer Good pts: 1. I left a message for a tech to call me. They called me within 10 minutes. 2. I then requested a fax diagram. Got it in 30 minutes. Not bad. 3. It took me 4 hours to install. That includes deciphering the instructions and locating wires. Second Time around would probably take less than an hour on a similar GM vehicle.4. I have no problem with the transmitting range yet. I haven't put the lower kickpanel back on yet until I add the passlock bypass and extra relay for the dome light.Bad pts. 1. It advertise trunk release and its even on the button. I shouldn't have to purchase additional relays for that.2. One glitch so far. They responsed to my email for a possible fix with 10 minutes of my email 7:00 in the morning. When ever I lock/unlock the doors with the driver door open the remote start button no longer starts the vehicle. Instead it unlocks the doors and the #2 button only locks not unlocks.anyone have the above problem please email me at sstacy@elkhart.k12.in.usI'll review it again when everything is back hooked up."

39206,0,"Note that I have *not* yet connected this device to an automobile; my experience is related to trying to connect it to my PC, which is what the manual eventually recommends, when you get past 10 pages of warnings.I have Windows 7 64-bit. The software that comes with the device is entirely unable to cope with this OS, which has been on the market for over a year now. I downloaded the Win7 64-bit drivers from their website, which installed fine and can detect the device when it is powered up.Then I downloaded V3 of their scanning software, since V1 (which came with it) can only partially detect the device. Unfortunately, V3 cannot see it at all!! So, with all Actron's drivers and software installed for Win7/64, the device cannot be connected to my computer at all.This is *really* not a very professional introduction to Actron products...I have a support request in to Actron, we'll see if I get anything useful from them.

I wanted a trickle charger, and it does the job beautifully.If you're a person who walks out and realizes you haven't driven your car for awhile, then this is the perfect solution.Battery Tender will take care of it all for you!"
154325,1,"Used both Mothers' tire spray products, Foaming and Mist. Foaming works very well, better than the Mist. The Mist did not cut through dirt as well as the Foaming. I had to do very little follow-up cleaning with a sponge. I have aftermarket wheels and they look great!A piece of advice regarding the tires... rinse very well then using a tire shine product. If you don't, your tires will look splotchy, not uniformily clean in appearance or dark. I have the Mothers tire cleaner and tire shine, they work better for the tires than the Mist."
84503,2,this thing did not fit in my 1992 lexus may it could be adjusted i just dont know how cut my finger on the darn thing
35334,1,"These are definitely worth the money. They are solid, heavy gauge copper. As the other reviewer pointed out, since they are not tin plated, they will corrode over time so it's a good idea to get some dielectric grease or battery terminal sealant on them after installation. Make sure to apply the sealant after installation so it doesn't get to where the ring is bolted to the terminal."
123155,1,"Yep, that's what it is all right. Mr. Fedex put it on my doorstep today! Seriously what do you write in a review of something like this?"
7983,1,This was a replacement for a 70A charger/converter that was installed in my sailboat. The installation was easy and the performance is exactly right. I have the manual controller dongle attached and it seems to recharge my 460AH battery bank quickly.The only information that I wish for is a set of curves that show voltage output vs current for the three modes of operation. Most people wouldn't care but I am an engineer-info freak.Bottom line- I would recommend this unit to anyone who needs a robust charger for a bank of batteries.
143796,2,Both bulbs blew out after only 6 months of use. I replaced with standard bulbs at 1/4 the cost. They are brighter than standard but I do not recommend.

183628,1,"I purchased this Du-Ha for a 2011 GMC 2500HD. It took longer to take out of the box than to put under the rear seat. If you ever want to remove it, just as fast and easy. Very sturdy and holds quite a bit of stuff. Keeps the clutter down and much neater. I waited a while to purchase it because it seemed a little expensive. If you can get over the price, I think you'll be glad you bought it. I recommend this item."
43198,0,"I ordered two of these kits in anticipation for another cold Minnesota winter. I received it within 2 days since I have Amazon Prime. I am pleased with the kit overall, but am disappointed as well.The kit seems sufficient with plenty to get by if I were to be stranded somewhere in the middle of no where. There's stuff to keep me warm, safe, and to signal others as well. Everything seems to be of mediocre quality, which is good enough for me.However, it is different from what is described.1) No Matches! The set of matches in both sets were replaced with another cheap candle due to shipping restrictions. What good are my 4 candles without matches?2) The flashlight is NOT a hand-charged dual LED flashlight. Instead it is an ordinary cheap flashlight with two AA batteries.The waterproof matches and the hand-charged flashlight were definitely selling points, and I'm not so sure I would have bought this particular set if it I knew these pitfalls ahead of time. Nonetheless, I'll keep them to save myself the hassle since I'm still better with the kits than without them.I am planning on adding a few items before I chuck it into my trunk. Some hard candy, extra socks, some baggies to keep my feet dry in case I need to trudge through some snow, a container to melt snow in, chapstick, a medium sized and durable container of cat litter, and finally my trusty jumper cables."
165274,1,are awesome! just saying haha they are great they are bright and really easy to install! even though i have never done any work with any part of any car it wasnt hard to find out. it literally took me longer to get positioned comfortably under the dash to hook stuff up than to actually hook up the lights. for anyone who wants to hook it up using the fuses under the dash! its simple.-firstly locate the fuse box/ the fuse that is 10amps that you are going to use.-you will need to strip the wires a little bit just enough to attach the wires.-the ground wire is the wire with the black. so find a screw or bolt that goes directly into the frame of the car loosen it just enough to slip the stripped ground wire behind it and then tighten it back on the wire. (thats it for the ground wire)- now make sure the car is off! remove the fuse from the fuse box. insert the stripped wire in the fuse box and replace the fuse on top of the wire.now its all good to go! place the lights where you want them. use some ties to clean up the wires between the controls and the bars and your good to go! :Dthis is an awesome kit looks very nice :] very happy with it
166098,2,When I read the prodcut description I undestood that this would fit well on my Harley XL883L. But I was disappointed when I saw that the product really consisted on only the end bits and I would need to replace the existing throttles to fit the Throttle Boss.
11537,2,"Unfortuanely this product is a complete waste. I have a 2010 Subaru Forester that dies regularly if the lights are left on...I tried using this on a completely unresponsive car, (lights left on all night) no go. I tried this on a car that had only had the lights left on for 20 minutes. Still it did not offer enough juice to start my car. I tried it with both clamps on both post on the battery as a reviewer suggested that, and it did not work then either. I followed all directs for charging and even tips left by reviewers. I would recommend trying a different brand, from a local auto parts store where you may be able to return it if it does not work...this one will have to go to the hazardous waste dump, I guess. Bummer!"

2717,2,"I have owned this helmet for about 2 years now and it has done its job perfectly well. It's comfortable, sturdy, and well crafted for its price. I am rating this helmet a one only because I can't give it a zero. The clear plastic visor has scratched up over the years of bugs, rocks, and drops which is on par with usual helmet wear. However there is no replacement visor available rendering the helmet useless to me. If you think you are saving money by buying this helmet think again. Now I am stuck buying a new helmet instead of a 12 dollar replacement visor. Get a name brand instead."

85141,1,"I've had these brakes on my 2005 Mustang since July 2012 and they absolutely work like a charm for me. After having the unfortunate problem of buying what I thought were ""ceramic"" pads from a local store I found out that the pads that I purchased were in fact NOT ceramic. Correct part#/box but someone made a switch before my purchase. I received a full refund which helped me pay for these ThermoQuiets. After that fiasco of the wrong pads in the box I went to another retail store and they recommended (swore by) ThermoQuiets. I decided to give them a shot and ordered them online as they were actually $20 bucks cheaper than the local store. I do have to say that i'm actually impressed. I went from Feb 2011 to July 2012 on loud squeaky pads to silence! I've had them installed for nearly 3 months now on my daily driver and I have absolutely NO squealing from my brakes. Not only that. The ""dusting"" that comes from these pads come ""clear"". So you don't have to worry about having 2 front tires that are more black than the rear. Then again the clear dusting is probably attributed to the pads being ceramic and not because they are ThermoQuiets. Regardless, I would actually purchase these again and I know my wife's Corolla is due for some new brake pads. I'll stick with ThermoQuiet's because they are quiet and they dust clearly and the car still brakes without issue in dry or wet situations."

29489,1,"I have been using K & N filters on all my cars for years and will continue to do so as long as they are available. This one replaced a stock filter and fit perfectly. The one I have on my 4Runner, after 120,000 miles of better than advertised gas mileage is still working great."
56497,1,"the four stars are for the amazon service, like always....was very very good....about the part i cannot rate it in this moment however:i purchased this ""Timken"" part because the name itself represents a ""good quality american made""...this part is for a ram 1500 truck with non ABS in front wheels, is not made in USA, is made in Korea, and has not a Timken ID in the part itself, only a seal in front where reads ""korea"" and a serial number, in fact the description note in little letters on the amazon site says: ""Note: Timken partners with other manufacturers to supply their complete line of quality parts. This product is in a Timken package, however the part may have been manufactured by an independent Timken supplier."" well no need to explain....the only Timken product you are purchasing is the Box where it came for shipped, i have received the part today and will install tomorrow, and cannot say if it is bad or good....however: the product looks fine, well constructed, solid, and like a good quality part...like a timken quality product.will update after 6 months of use..."
143246,1,Great Product. I bought it as a gift for my husband who is a truck driver and he loves it!! Works great.
45503,1,"This was one of the first tools I bought when I started working in a brake and muffler shop 18 years ago. It saw daily use in all temperatures and never failed. After six years I moved on to other work, but the IR 231 was still going strong and was passed on top a coworker who was just starting out.Yeah, it's heavy. But the guys with the Snap On impact guns that cost twice as much were having theirs rebuilt every other year, my IR just kept plugging along. A couple drops of air tool oil every day and a shot of grease once in a while and the IR outlasted my need for it."

153409,0,"I bought this sticker simply because it said, ""carpe diem"". Things that say carpe diem on them are rare. My only complaint was the time it took for me to get it. I ordered other stuff at the same time through amazon.com with their free shipping deal and I got ALL of that stuff before I got this sticker. Also take note of the size of the sticker. It's listed but most people don't pay attention. I assumed the sticker would've been bigger."
147435,2,"This equipment is quality built. However, I didn't see that it was the exact same part that already comes with the winch carrier, not the wiring kit for the rear of the truck that I thought I was purchasing and that would have expanded the winch's usefulness. I don't understand why it is not returnable."
88662,0,"I make signs, and so I find this cheap, standard brand name riveter on Amazon. This riveter came to me NIB (new in box) and was supposed to work right out of the package. And it did, only just once! While it did buck the first rivet tight against a hole in 0.50"" thick aluminum, the stem of the rivet broke off and got stuck in the internal jaws of the riveter and would not come out. The riveter refused to let go of it even after trying to twist, push, and pull it in both directions with a big pair of pliers. Since it was supposed to release the rivet's stem automatically after it snaps, this is an obvious defect.It is a piece of junk with the stem still stuck in the riveter, so frustrated, we started tearing it down, removing the nose piece, axle rod, and springs until the whole thing was apart. This is not easy- you have to figure out how to put it back together when this happens, and it requires having a someone with a third hand and a screwdriver to push the spring deep into the end of the barrel opposite of the jaws inside the barrel where the rivet just happens to be inserted. The spring has to be pushed down toward the jaw mechanism while the other person inserts the round rod that holds the spring down into the barrel, through the cross section of the barrel, before that strong spring has chance to pop back up! Difficult to do, but it fixed the problem after we got it back together.We took this river apart and put it back together FIVE times as it did the same thing to four other rivets in a row until we added a drop of 3-in-one machine oil to the parts working inside, and then the riveter started releasing the stems every time a riveting operation was performed. Problem cured!The 3 stars I give this riveter are from the fact that we were able to take it apart, fix it, put it back together, and continue using it. Although this made me happy in the end, I do NOT recommend this riveter unless you are mechanically inclined and know how to properly take it apart, disassemble, and put it back together, again and again. Doing so might save you a little money, but it sure is a whole lot of trouble and almost a waste of time. Upgrade to theStanley MR100CG Contractor Grade Riveterinstead."

5606,1,"THis is an excellent tire pressure gauge for most any pressure reading application. It is very accurate and automatically holds the pressure reading until released with a thumb switch. Uses a flexible hose to reach any tire valve-- no matter how hard to reach. The only problem is that this is not a one hand quick use tool. When you take a reading with one hand, the dial hangs down while you press into the tire valve. You need 2 hands to simultaneously take a reading and read the gauge dial result."
109255,1,"Ordered this hardware to mount some fork mounted wind deflectors that I made.The hardware is high quality and holds the deflectors very securely.I have now ridden about 10,000 miles with absolutely no problems.

160672,1,"I'll start stating that this is a great product, and the only difference that I'm aware between these and the Premiums (Warn 20990 for most Dana 44 axles) is the cap, and the cap is the main issue for me here... Since my 93 Bronco had the unreliable automatic hub lockers I decided to replace them with manuals, which won't dissengage if I back up, and upon searching on my local market all I was able to find were these, even though I wanted the Premiums, well, I installed these very easily but ever since I bought them I've been bothered by the Nylon dial on the cap. Don't get me wrong, again, these are a great product and for most of the average users they will outlast these old trucks, but I have seen what the sun has done to some of them installed on other trucks and I don't want the same, I've even seen some with broken dials.Installation is rather easy, and they fit very well and tight in the hub. If you search ""Ford (87 - 96 F-150/Bronco) front end rebuild&#8206;"" on the net you'll find a very detailed tutorial with pictures, made by me. They worked fine for the little under a year I had them installed, even though they didn't see much use, but they didn't leak a drip of grease, which is very good. They do what they should with no fuzz at all, and they take 1/4 of a turn to lock (I never knew if this was better or worse, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter). Oh! almost forgot! It is very important to check with the manufacturer if your application will require the replacement of your OEM spindle nut with their kit (WARN 32720 Spindle Nut Kit), i.e.: Broncos with auto-hubs with 5 bolts in the cap won't need it, but if they have 3 bolts they will.These come with a limited lifetime warranty from Warn, and they won't let you down, but for me Nylon isn't the best material for the harsh condition these lockers will endure, so if possible, I would go with PremiumsWARN 20990 Premium Manual Hubsor with the ones I currently own, Mile Marker P/N 104 Supreme HubsMile Marker 104 Supreme Locking Hub. I have to give the cap a little point here, it's easier to operate than that of the Mile Marker, that seems to require very small fingers...Overall, I would say these are a 4.5/5 (stupid dial...) but since I can't rate them like that, then 4/5 it is. One last tip: these usually go for aprox. 30% less than the Premiums, and at the same price of the P/N 104, so keep that in mind if you're within a budget."
28514,2,"Installed these along with a Monroe SS shocks & c3fab ext, lower & upper control arms and the ride height is wacked. Looks like the back sits lower than the front. I will definitely be replacing these in the near future and I will NEVER EVER buy another Eibach product. I've installed Sprint & H&R Springs and loved them both. Eibach has good ride quality but looks STOOOOOOPID on your car. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!! Yes I gave the springs time to settle and they are installed correctly with the end of the lower coil between the drain plugs in the lower control arm. Never dreamed I would have a problem like this from a reputable spring maker."
63129,1,"Fit my 97 Subaru Legacy 2.2L. The old gaskets (OEM, I believe) were leaking oil. I replaced them with the fel pro, and no leaks so far. It includes the gasket/washers for the three bolts that attach the valve cover to the cylinder head."

110866,0,"I was drawn to these blades by their simplicity. In theory they should not gather ice and freeze solid as do standard blades. They also shouldn't ""lift"" at high speeds like the ""winter"" blades previously available. After 5 months of use I have come to a final opinion. First, these do not lift at high speeds, but they tend to be very loud when wiping under normal rain conditions. They do provide a clean wipe, possibly better than average. Unfortunately the winter performance is not as superior as I had hoped it would be. Ice does build up at the two ends of the solid plastic bracket that holds the blade to the arm. This causes a rigid section in the middle of the blade where the windshield will not be wiped at all, just as with standard blades. The ice can be cleared quite easily, but it happens frequently in freezing rain / wet snow.In conclusion, the loud wiping noise combined with the continued freezing-up problem negates the advantages relative to the added cost. If you've got the extra cash burning a hole in your pocket try them out."
22007,2,"Spark plug wires were identified to fit my 1993 Chevy 5.7L Silverado. This was more of a universal set. Good quality wires, but one wire was missing the boot on one end and the coil wire had a connector on one end that did not fit the coil. Had to modify to make it work."
92171,2,"I relied on the Amazon's recommendation engine to find the right size for my BMW 323i. It turns out the driver side recommended blade is 2"" shorter than the OEM blades. They still work, however, but I am sure a portion of my windshield is now missing coverage. Can't comment on the actual functionality of the product yet, as we only had one storm so far.Update: Just had some decent rain storm in Calif. These blades performed fine when working. BUT ...1) Driver's side is clearly too short, adn about 1.5"" patch in the middle of my windshield is not covered. No big deal practically, but annoying.2) When driving fast on the freeway, there was one time, maybe because of heavy wind, the driver side wiper actually lifted - as in, not touching the glass. This happened on one side. When compared to the OEM blade, the OEM frame is a lot heavier, and has a contraption that seems like an airfoil. Maybe this is why. Compared to OEM blade, Anco seems light weight. Overall, can't say I would recommend these for my car (BMW)."
185275,0,"I ended up having to get these professionally installed because of the Drilling required. If you plan to install yourself and don't want to mess with drilling make sure you contact Westin. The finished product is nice, but I wasted a lot of time before realizing the bracket would not match up to the Factory pre-drilled holes. The guy who installed said he sees this all the time on Fords. Installation was about $70 in Richmond Va if you are factoring in this cost to your purchase."
57360,0,"I am only currently giving this a 3 star rating.I have not hooked up completely yet.This is a very nice looking gauge.The problem is, the air line for the boost is only 6 feet long.This will likely be long enough for most small import applications, anything else, good luck.I have been looking around trying to find someone who sells just the air line, and have had no luck so far.I have a 2004 F350 Lariat. I have installed this gauge beside a voltmeter gauge in a dual pod and have it mounted on my dash off to the left so not to obscure my vision, I think it looks really good.Update:Installed 3 weeks ago once I was finally able to find a supplier for this 1/8 inch id tubing....very difficult to find a part like this. Hose, t-fittings, reducers, came to about another $20....thought all of that would have been way more, but still was not expecting to pay extra on top of the gauge.Hooked everything up, works as expected, but as the boost increases, so does the 'fluttering' on the gauge needle. I don't really care about that, I just wanted a boost gauge to show me that my turbo is functioning normally..."

121903,1,it was better than I thought for the price and it worked amazingly on my 95 wr250z it even came with the cover for the clutch
113532,0,"First of all, if you want to buy this on Amazon, look around a little more here first. As of right now, Amazon has 4 different pages of 7300's with varying prices. Kinda confusing.I was very hopeful this would be a good product, and it is, but it definitely has its flaws. I tried it on two different cars. I drained the oil normally first in order to see if the vacuum got more oil out than just draining alone. It did, and a substantial amount on both cars too. I was pretty happy with this. I even used the hose to suck out the oil filter pipe which had even more oil.The biggest problem with this unit is the short hoses! They are so short that I had to pick the evacuator up and put it in my engine bay because otherwise the dipstick tube only went in a few inches. And these are normal size sedans too, nothing jacked up. I imagine buying longer hose at the hardware would fix this, but I wish they would have just put longer hoses on instead.The other problem is the way this pump is designed means it is always expelling lots of air, which means my compressor was on a lot more than I would like, cycling on and off. If you have a large tank you might be better off though. Also, the sound of the air rushing out and the compressor running makes for a noisy oil change.Oh, and forget the product description about pre-charging the unit and then taking it to the job site. That would last about 1-2 seconds of suction probably. This thing needs constant suction from your compressor to pull the oil out.I also used this to bleed brakes and a clutch. The universal brake adapter included is not that tight of a fit, and because of the short hose bleeding the clutch required me to put the unit on its side, which I had to do carefully so that fluid wouldn't go down the air compressor suction tube.The height of the thing can be kind of a problem too, especially when it's empty. It is prone to fall over. It does have a little metal thing to step on, but you can't always be by the unit when dealing with the hoses. I think they could have made this shorter and fatter.Another issue I had was removing the hoses from the unit. The rubber around the hose gets sucked on even more with the air pressure and removing it can be a pain, and several times the hose came out, but not the rubber piece that should have come out. I had to use pliers to pull it out once. I would recommend a screw type design instead.The only reason I am giving this item a positive rating is because it actually did get more oil out than draining alone did. I also plan on using this to change my coolant.If it was about $40-$50 cheaper, this product would be just about right for how much it does and how well it does it. But at around $80, you might kind of feel ripped off."
31729,1,"I use this in my camper as my only power supply. It does the job great. They don't tell you that to produce that much power will take several batteries. I use three deep cycle and i can run everything except the power hogs (water heater, heater and air conditioner) for several days before i have to charge the batteries. The only thing i don't like about it is, it beeps when the power consumption is heavy and after 30 seconds it will shut off. The low battery shut off works a little to well. I have to run my charge system to get the amperage that it requires to produce 1500 watts or more for more than 5 minutes. Other than that, I love the fact that i can go camping where ever i want and will always have power. Running the refrigerator, T.V., and other small accesories is easy. And it will do that for days on one battery as long as you don't waste power."
79584,1,"This dash cover is really an excellent value for the low price. But if you're picky about the color matching the interior of your vehicle perfectly... or if you want a precision fit and finish... then you could be a little disappointed. I bought a caramel colored model for a 2006 Honda Civic Hybrid, and the DashMat color doesn't match (or even compliment) any of the browns or tans in the vehicle. But it's tolerable and quite usable. The fit isn't perfect either, but quite good. The quality of the materials and construction are fine."

70273,0,"When I received my MV50 it was well packaged and I almost decided to just toss it in my trunk for the next day I really needed to pump up my tires. It turns out, testing it was well worth my time. The air hose didn't actually fit on the nozzle. I emailed the company and they have yet to respond to my inquiry. It has been more than a week.... I'm sure it is just a minor manufacturing defect; however, if you're looking for a quality product that is supported by a reachable manufacturer, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this one."
142721,2,"I have two complaints about this riveter.1. The different heads are very easy to lose. They are stored in threaded holes in the handle, but do not tighten down like every other riveter. The sloppy fit makes them easy to lose. Replacements are not available. I have lost several, but, fortunately, was able to find them. I no longer depend on the threaded holes for storage.2. The plastic jar to catch the used stems is a loose fit on its cap, and falls off while in use, spilling them all over.What is it with China and threads?But, it does pull 1/4 rivets, so I will just have to live with its faults. I would give it 4 stars without those faults."

Since they are plastic I thought the weight might break them, but we've used them at least 10 times now and not even a crack. Used on a 16ft ultralight KZ Coyote with a slide. It didn't get the 5 star because the back side is honeycombed in design which gives it it's strength but also traps dirt, sometimes you have to slap them around to get the stuff out."

The 2 patches on the front I can handle; 5+ more, NO. If I had known they were there I would not have purchased the jacket. Since I got it for such a good price it is not worth the shipping fee to return it. I will donate it to a local charity that provides coats for the needy, and buy my son another jacket."

Too bad they don't give any instructions about sealing the threads on that thing before installing. In fact, if you're a newb be warned that there are no instructions at all.Update: plumber's tape and the freeze plug doesn't leak.Head's up: if you don't have a diagram of how your serpentine belt goes on, you better make one. Removing the serpentine gave much better access to the tstat housing. If you have AC, the AC lines go over the top of the housing, so the entire housing must come off to seal that freeze plug. $#@!I guess, given that the part is so inexpensive, that one can't go wrong in buying it. It's one third the price of the OEM part, and comes with a serious gasket, just make sure to seal that threaded freeze plug in before installation.Use that gray rtv on all surfaces of the gasket btw. And just for yucks and grins I roughed up the gasket side of the housing using 800 grit paper."
67794,0,"My package arrived within the the time estimated. The Tensioner packaging had the Dayco tensioner written on it with all corresponding model part number printed on the box. Inspecting the product itself, I discovered that it was not the Dayco tensioner I ordered but another brand called INA, although the same replacement model for my vehicle. The Dayco model was made in Germany according to the the outside of the box. The INA version is made in Slovakia embossed on the tensioner. I am in Australia, so returning the item was not really an option as I needed to replace my old tensioner as soon as possible. The INA part works, so no real complaint, though it could have been a big problem otherwise. I have taken photos if verification is needed. This is the first time this has happened from all items I have purchased from Amazon."
31832,2,"While the 'Find Parts' tool states ""This product fits your 2007 Volkswagen GTI"", it does not. It's about an inch longer than the one it's replacing, and that inch is enough to prohibit it from being installed. It's not possible to open the tailgate far enough to install.Update: For 2007 GTI you want Stabilus SG301053. I purchased them from Auto Barn for ~$33. With 2 there was free shipping. Worked like a champ and far better construction than the Strongarm brand."
30572,1,"I'm in the process of rebuilding a 1977 Pontiac 400 for a 1981 Trans Am and needed this exact 76-81 fuel pump incorporating both a 3/8"" fuel line, 1/4"" return line and fitting for hard line from pump to carburetor. This pump is a direct replacement for my application. Not only that but it includes a gasket and detailed instructions. The best part, this pump is made in the U.S.A.The product photo shows the metal canister portion having a black finish. Mine came with a yellow zinc or yellow cadmium finish. The casting portion looks similar to photo.The pump may be from old stock, but the pump itself appears to have been made very recently. If it is a NOS part, they've done a great job storing it as it's free of dust and corrosion."
174084,0,"Works fine but I downgraded because it looks longer in the photograph, however, it is only about 24"" length. There is also a cap for the cigarette adapter end that is not shown in the photo."
49925,1,"The Thule 571 is well suited to install and remove our 1800 cargo box on our Volvo wagon. Just pull the car in the garage under the box, crank the box down to the load bars, slide the rope off the ends of the box and tighten the box clamps to the load bars. One person can do the whole thing in a few minutes. Plus it's a great way to get the box up and out of the way when it's not in use.The mounting and installation directions leave a fair bit to creative interpretation. Our garage is open joists so I cut short sections of 2x4s to mount between the joists enabling me to anchor the pulleys and other support hardware where it needed to go. Plan on a few hours to get the whole thing mounted. But once it's up, it's terrific. There's sufficient tension in the crank to hold an empty cargo box in place once you've cranked it to the desired position.Our package arrived with one essential part missing. The customer service folks at Thule happily sent me what I needed in the mail. It took a few phone calls to keep the no-charge order in the pipeline, but after a few weeks, I got what I needed."

51082,0,"As far as snow-tubing is concerned, this tube is great for a child or perhaps a young teenager, but good luck fitting on it if you're adult! I think that an adult may have a better time water-tubing on it though. Fully inflated, this tube comes up to my thigh while standing."
156737,2,"These are by far the worst wipers I have ever purchased. I went with Bosch based on thier reputation for solid engineering and recommendation from several reviews here. This is clearly a product where the balance between form and function took a heavy bias toward form and ignored function. I installed these on my 2007 Accord and found they worked WORSE than my cheap wipers from a local retailer that were a year old. They do not contact the windshield with enough pressure to get a clean swipe and leave streaks in both rain, slush, and snow. I called Amazon and asked for an RMA to return...unfortunately it went several weeks without rain/snow here and I'm outside of normal return window. Disappointed in both Amazon and in Bosch."
44057,1,I use this with my OEM VW roof rack. I drilled holes in the rack for this to fit perfectly! You can search for articles on how to do this yourself.
51960,1,"I would have given this box 5 stars but there are just a few small details that I want to point out so others may make a educated decision when shopping for these boxs. First is the condition it arrived in, the lid is slightly damaged/bent in several corners and a few small scratches that removed the finish. I could have returned it for another but they are very small and after all it is going in the bed of my truck. Second would be a few design issues, the sliding tool trey rest about half way down in the box so if u have much in the box you cant slide it for easier access to the trey or the area below it. Also the key does not want to go in, it requires a lot of ""working"" with it to get it in. It does seem to be getting easier to get in the more I use it. Over all this box is a quallity product, well made, perfect size and it looks great. The lid opens and shuts perfectly and seems pretty secure when its locked. FYI this box is not the one pictured it is the black lowprofile deltapro with the lips on the ends to rest on the bed top, I always check the product numbers with the manufacturers website."
9937,1,I like using the net and bar to separate my bed in my truck and the net is nice for small light items.
12023,1,The Battery Tender is the real deal...it's easy to use and does what it is supposed to do. It will keep your battery at peak charge without overdoing it and a simple indicator light will keep you informed of the battery status with just a quick look. Set it and forget it. The bottom line is that this is a great product and you will not find a lower price than Amazon.
100294,2,I have purchased this product after seeing it advertised on TV and this stuff does not work - garbage - a waste of money & time.
82843,2,"Valley 52040 Plug Protector apparrently is a trailer mount plug in type protector. it is not the rubber boot/dust cap that's in the photo. if you buy this, you will be either mounting it on your trailer with some screws or sending it back to the guy with who put the wrong photo in the description."

84886,1,"I bought two of these covers for my seats. I love the print but for some reason I recieved two covers taht fit differently and patterns varied as well. The first one I put on was extrememly tight and ripped going on, plus it had a slight red tone. The second one ( I was nervous putting on) went on like a dream. Great balck and white shading and went on very smoothly. Perfect fit. Still not sure what to do with the one yet. Our family loves the beach so these were fitting, per say, for the motif. Now to find other accessories!!!!"

68214,1,I wanted to replace the orginal muffler on my Toyota 2000 4Runner with one of equal quality. The Walker muffler was a direct fit with no adjustment needed to the under carraige mounting straps. This made it easy to install. The price was very compeditive and included free shipping. Overall a great deal!
161015,2,"Don't waste your money on this piece of junk unless you want your vehicle to overheat. I bought this one and it didn't work from the second I put it in. I'm not a beginner at wiring but I rechecked all connections and they were right. So I went to the parts store and bought the identical one. It worked for a day and then it stopped and nearly overheated my truck. I wouldn't put another one in if I was paid to do it. You're better off throwing your money in the trash because that's what you'll end up with. I don't write reviews, but hopefully this will save you some headache and money. It has one star because it wouldn't let me give it zero or negative stars."
135353,0,"It needs cutting to fit my 07 Pathfinder. Also, the ends cover ther air vents when used in the 2nd row. It does not have ridges to hold snow during winter so be careful when making this purchase. Quality is really good tho."
35572,0,Took a while to get it. The mounting hardware was wrong too. Price was right. Works with my old hardware. Well worth the price.
72311,2,"I ordered an Air Filter from Eastern Performance Cycles, it said that my package would arrive on September 13th at the latest.

Now it is more than a week later and I still haven't received my package, or an email saying when it will become available. I could have bought this item from somewhere else and had it by now.

44995,1,Looks great on my car and is made very durable! I recommend it to anyone because it's made really good and looks great. Received it in great time.
13387,1,The cans don't keep their compression forever. Nonetheless they're a better option than carrying a big ol' can of compressed air everywhere.
151697,0,"Yes the throttle response is better and yes the fuel consumption is better but, considering the box says that this is ""drop-in"" and requires no modifications, the front, outboard corners of the filter housings will not seat properly and the torx screw in that location will not screw all the way in. Have asked K&N Techinical Support to advise if the rubber ""gasket"" piece can be trimmed to allow the housing to seat properly; no answer as of yet."
155208,2,This horn sounds great on the motorcycle. In less than 1 year the 'Chrome Plastic' looks awful. I am very unhappy with the quality of the horn. It says chrome and not chrome plastic. The warranty is only good for 90 days. Go figure.

71409,1,I haven't seen my 2002 Chevy Tahoe shine like that since I bought the truck in 2002. I thought the dirt in my truck would only come off with some heavy duty body shop machines but who would know a little clay job would do the job.
173305,1,"This is the perfect tool to remove and install the spark plugs on a Ford 5.4 engine. And it did work, but the rubber insert would not hold the spark plug in place. This is the feature you really need the most as replacement of the plugs on this engine is already stressful enough with out the spark plugs falling out of the tool. I used a loop in a small wire to retrive the spark plug out of the engine as the plug would just slip out of the rubber insert upon removal from the engine and fall back into the engine.I used electric tape on the new plug to put them in and then pulled the tape off the plug once installed and tightened down. I sure did not want to drop a new spark plug and break it. Really strange as the tool is well made except for this and it is special designed for just these spark plugs and engine. I had to knock off a star because of this."
31035,2,Bought two sets of these type of headlamp replacements and was dismayed to find that they each lasted far less than 1 year. There is a ONE TIME warranty replacement PER PERSON. Buy any other bulb but this. Less than a year life for a auto headlamp is NOT ACCEPTABLE.
87538,0,Length:: 1:20 MinsMake no mistake. This is a cheap stamped steel unit. But it was available locally when I needed it and it was cheap. Folks complain about its quality... what do they expect for about 5 bucks?
165956,2,"I ordered two. Both worked well out of the box. Came pre-charged. Gives an adequate but not brilliant light. Good for working under a car.Of the two, one lost most of the pixels the day after I lit it the first time. I keep my fingers crossed that the other one stays good."
66499,1,"The price for this filter ($31.00) was less than the OEM paper filter you have to replace every 6000 to 7000 miles. And the beauty of K & N filters is when dirty you just wash it with K & N cleaner & water & just let air dry,then reoil with K & N filter spray oil. Also the filter will probably out live your bike."
30345,2,"The visors came in perfect condition and very fast - that was great. But the product was so thin in the width it barely even fits the window channels/frames. It hardly does anything about venting the car that they are practically useless. I am totally disappointed in this product, but I should have known better. I have three other vehicles that have window frames. The other vent visors I purchased worked on the INSIDE of the window frame and fit and work perfectly - I love them. BUT, there is no window frame on my 1996 Dodge Neon and the style of window vent I received had to mount on the outside of the car's exterior - not a good product at all - save your money, time and energy on these."

16087,2,The pictures make this tool look like the real item. IT IS NOT! This tool failed on my first attempt to use it. The low price is still a waste of money.
155530,2,I bought this to lower the rear of my 2004 Dodge Dakota Quad Cab V8 2 inches to level it with the front. The U bolts aren't big enough for my axle.
32277,0,"The picture for this product, #25533 Brembo front rotor, shows it's drilled. This model rotor is NOT DRILLED, as I found out after I received it. Still a good price with the included free shipping, but it's not what I thought I was buying.UPDATE 1/13/2013: I know this product might no longer be available, but just in case someone needs this information down the road... So far I've had these rotors in my Highlander about as long as the factory originals, and these have been much more durable. They're still in service at this time and without any sign of warpage. The only possible down side to this model is the dimples it puts into the surface as wear indicators. I think this is useful for showing wear, but unfortunately some mechanics don't know what they are and one even considered it a defect during a state vehicle inspection. I had to explain to him the dimples were there by design :O But on the other hand, he might have just been trying to rip me off, as unfortunately many mechanics around here now have the same (deserved) reputation as used car salesmen."

171713,0,The muffler is exactly what I wanted in regards to the sound. It is just a little bit louder than stock. The muffler has been installed on my GMC Canyon for a almost three weeks now. I have not seen any increase in MPG though which is the reason I purchased it.
85265,1,"Not too noticeable on a street bike, but now I have more air and clean air going in. Move tank for install."
175574,1,"I'm pleased with this cushion. It supports my back right where I need it. Since most chairs don't have the lumbar support area built in, this cushion allows me to take the much needed support with me wherever I go. The one flaw is that there isn't any ties so it does move around when you move or get up. It is holding up well. I think it is a good deal for what I paid. I'd buy it again."
145180,0,It works as advertised but it removes all shine and leaves a very dull/dry surface behind. I much prefer the medium or high shine version of this with the scotch gaurd added in

However, today I received my order and I was sent the TWO prong adapter set, item number 0106. The description for the product says you may receive either adapter, but from the item description, it appeared I was getting the 0107. I now have to contact Hoerr to get this fixed, and I'm sure it's going to cost me a bundle in shipping. Just FYI before anyone else orders so you don't get the wrong item. The title is misleading."

53238,0,This was lighter duty than expected - thinner metal. Also it is already getting some surface rust after only one season. I would not say i am unhappy with it - it does serve it function ok - it is just a little lighter duty than expected.
89616,1,"Great Bulbs. I have these in my 2000 Toyota Echo (see customer pictures), and they look great. About the same brightness as the orange ones that were in there, but give the car a completely different look with the headlights/parking lights on at night. Love them because they're completely legal, but aftermarket as well. Easy inexpensive way to dress up your ride a bit. Pair well with the Silverstar Headlamps I have installed too. Not too bright like Xenon's, but much better than cheap ones. Great product. No complaints at all. I did however find them cheaper at O'Rileys Autoparts here locally for $13.01 including sales tax. Just and FYI."

47324,0,"This single tailpipe part walker #45807Walker Exhaust 45807 Tail Pipeis not long enough( about 11 inches short) to fit my vehicle as recommended to fit by amazon as well all the resources I found online. After searching all over the net I found the missing (Obsolete part #41740Walker Exhaust 41740 Hardware-Tru-Fit), which is 11 inches long with a bend in the center. This part is necessary for the complete replacement of the tailpipe from the muffler out. It is not even shown on the diagram provided by [...]. It should be located in between muffler 2500 and tail pipe 45807 about where a two inch adapter is shown on the diagram with part numbers that relate to clamps and hangers. Local parts stores don't stock exhaust pipes and have to special order them, and part #41740 retails for less than 5 dollars(+shipping) totaling over $20, it's the extra shipping that bollixes things up. Ironically, pipe # 45807 alone would have been long enough if there were not so many unnecessary bends (That avoid nothing on my vehicle), just not a good fit all around. I hope this part #41740 works as I have ordered it (from Amazon) as well as the #45708 already. My recommendation is to research well before you order and don't trust the "" Will this fit you vehicle feature?"" as this is the second item I ordered based on its recommendations that did not fit or was missing some parts.Hard to rate an item that is incomplete, gave it a three because eventually it will be assembled and useable.So far, bummer experience"

85179,1,"The crack running down the length of my muffler was pretty big. The putty was thick enough to fill the crack like bondo without dripping out or sagging. I used it first, then applied muffler tape over it. I heated the putty with my heat gun before applying tape to make sure it set up some and wasnt soft like toothpaste. That was a good call. I wasnt sure if the exhaust pressure would blow the putty out before the putty could harden so the heat gun was my insurance. One package of putty (2 packs inside) was enough to do my entire muffler."

2955,0,"I have only used the conditioner so far. The label says it will not ""stain"" leather. But the conditioner will turn leather darker if you use more than a little mist and brushed in per the instructions. After about about two weeks, the leather will revert to nearly its original color. Applying the conditioner is tricky. I used a clean shoe-shine brush to make it easier and faster. The conditioner will make nu-buck leather shiny. The shine will fade, though. Not sure what it will do to suede. But the conditioner does prevent my nu-buck leather from drying. The conditioner has a strange fatty smell. But it will go away after a while, if not completely."

It's thin, light, twistable like a plain $5 frame found at local auto part stores. I think the frame should have been at least twice the thickness. The finish and edges are clean though. To me a good frame, beside having nice finish and clean cut, should be stiff (i.e. thick) enough so it doesn't twist and keeps the licence plate from rattling when driving on rough roads or pot holes. To me this frame doesn't seem worth $30. Maybe $15..."
115261,1,R&R in 40 seconds. Nothin' to it. Fits perfectly and cleans just like a squeegie. lol
171838,0,"This is a loud horn that will catch the attention of inattentive drivers. Unlike the big rig horns that apparently have pressurized tanks that instantly create airflow (and thus sound), this horn has an electo-mechanical compressor that drives the horn directly; there is no tank and so there is no instant sound -- you have to have your hand on the button for a fraction of a second before the horn will sound. Under normal situations, this is not important. Under emergency situations, this could be problem. I also wonder how well it will work with my alarm, because when I lock my car remotely, there is not enough airflow to sound the notification warning. Lastly, it is a REAL PAIN to install. It took my mechanics 4 hours and nearly $300 for the parts and labor necessary to install it. Had I known what it would take to install, I would have avoided this horn and opted for a loud standard horn that could be installed with ease."
25320,2,"_Perfectly fine product and, as always with Amazon, got it at a GREAT price. But it did not work on my friends 2001 Toyota. She has a 2001 v6 Camry automatic; the 1mz-fe engine. It has 2 upstream ""air/fuel"" sensors (NOT to be confused with ordinary oxygen sensors, despite what you may have heard on forums or elsewhere), and downstream there is 1 ordinary oxygen sensor (not to be confused with an air/fuel sensor). That's a total of 3 sensors in the exhaust system. Yes indeed.....only 3.We were trying to save some money when buying this sensor. But sometimes saving a couple bucks doesn't pay.....apparantly.For those of you that don't know, the p1135 code means that there is a problem at the exhaust system's upstream sensor location called ""bank 1 sensor 1"". That is the trouble code her car had, and the sensor I set out to replace. But this Denso 234-4209 did not work. My suspected reasons for it not working are either that it is totally incompatible with the car, or that the other upstream sensor at the location called ""bank 2 sensor 1"" needs to be an exact match to the one used in bank 1 sensor 1. Since her car still had the original sensor at B2S1 (which is a Denso 234-9021), it is very possible that is the case.I do know this much: After I had no luck with this 4209 sensor, I ordered the 9021 and problem is now fixed; check engine light is gone. If you want to know immediately after installing the sensor whether the new one is gonna work or not, be sure to disconnect battery cable for a half a minute or so after the job's done. Doing that will zero out the trouble codes. Otherwise, if you do not zero them out, you'll have to wait for a certain number of rpm's or key cycles to pass before the car's computer to determine whether or not it now has a properly funtioning sensor in place of the old faulty one - which may take a couple days for it to do....I really don't know exactly how long; but probably longer than you wanna wait.So, to anyone with a car like my friends (which has the 1mz-fe engine; an engine used not only in Camry's but also in some Lexus's, the Toyota Sienna, and many other Toyota's), your best bet is to order the Denso 234-4029 and save yourself time and aggravation, as well as having to splice and reconnect wires (which is what you will have to do with the 9021 sensor...but not with the 4209 sensor as it comes complete with new plug attached).P.S.Here's a thought (and this is to further a point I made at the end of my third paragraph):Perhaps if I put matching 4209's in both upstream locations (B2S1 and B1S1) this also would have solved the problem. I wouldn't be a bit surprised. That of course would mean I'd be replacing one good sensor (the one at B2S1), but oh well.....I'd now likely have two new working sensors on my car and 20 or 30 extra bucks in my pocket. And if such an idea worked, it could actualy mean that both upstream simply need to match each other exactly in order for system to work right. This hypothisizing I'm doing right now just reminded me of a mechanic who once told me that whenever he replaces exhaust system sensors, he likes to replace all - depending on whether the problem exists in the upstream or the downstream. Eg, if a car has an upstream sensor problem and said car happens to have 3 upstream sensors, he will replace all three. Or if a car has 2 downstream sensors, he'll replace the two of them. By him saying this, it would seem to support my theory--that all downstreams need to match each other exactly, and same story with the upstreams.Actually, when I get some spare cash, I might just test my litle theory."

Well when I opened the door the windows ripped the visors right off. They are supposed to go higher so that the windows can clear them. After running to the hardware store for more double sided tape I got them properly installed according to the directions. I believe this product is defeatist as the point of it is to create a wind break RIGHT ABOVE THE WINDOW NOT AN INCH ABOVE! There is a reason why it was so hard to find this set... the entire concept of a window vent is not kosher for cars that have no door frame. They simply made them so that people who know no better would buy them, but they do not keep weather and wind out very well at all. In fact with the window open a crack I now have a jet of cold air hit me just behind my ear. It's winter here now, and I'm afraid of the rain come this spring. Bottom line... SAVE YOUR MONEY!"

Otherwise the spot would have to be enlarged by sanding.This think is a thick milky thick liquid. I cut out a narrow flexible plastic strip as the applicator, pour a small drop on a clean sheet, and dip the thing on the spot.

No problem finding where they went and no issue since.The 13.5 amp breaker might seem strange, but if running at 240...240*13.5=3240Watts. How about that, just as rated! I am able to run the 1500W smoker (12.5 amps+), and still handle the starting surge and run my 7 amp shop vac and a large portable stereo speaker boost system. My Fluke multimeter shows the voltage at 112 steady as a rock. I am more than satisfied.After run in, my only issue is that the handle rattles during operation and probably adds a few dbs to the sound level, but a bungie cord will solve that.As I could by 3 of these for the price of a Honda 2000W and I don't need silent running, I am more than satisfied with my purchase."
73061,0,I bought these lights to use on my hunting boat during the early morning hours before the sun comes up to locate my hunting spot. These are small and sleek but the amount of light from them makes them only good for a shore light. I did remove the black diffuser that another reviewer had mentioned and they do work a little bit better but are still not good as a boat headlight. Shipping took about 8 business days.

23477,0,"I think for the price, you can do better. Go to your local auto parts store and get one cheaper. I bought the leather one, but after using it, a cloth one would do the job just as well as the leather one. Actually the leather one makes my shoulder sweaty after awhile.It needs to be longer or it needs someting to keep it in place, as it slips down and I have to constantly re-adjust as I'm driving. Overall, it does what it is supposed to do I guess."
36557,1,The item is as described size medium fits my 2008 gsxr 600 perfect. Just like the photo. It comes attached with a small pouch so in other words if you unzip the pouch the cover comes out then to put the cover away you would stuff it back in the carrying pouch however.. a part of the pouch already was ripped. does not affect the use or any part of the actual cover. so I really don't mind. It does the job and the price is right. worth every penny. thanks

38726,1,"Using this to wrap an intake system for my car. Driving an RX8 the under hood temps get quite toasty as the rotary engine gets pretty hot for its size. Since I do a lot of autocross my main concern was heatsoak after installing an intake system. By wrapping the intake in the Cool Tap I found that my IAT's legitimately dropped compared to other autocross days with similar weather. It is a cheap, quick way to protect the air being fed into your engine."
87429,1,2010 Honda Goldwing very good price for a performance filter that can be washed and reused. Plus I believe that K&N filters flow more air.
165367,1,i have 1992 ford f150 2wd and just wanted little more to the truck and it set very low. This kit was easy to install and fit exactlly the was it said it would. the only thing that it doesnt say is that the fan shroud and the clutch fan will not work after the install. i had to get electric cooling fans to keep truck at normall temp at idle and to be able to run my ac. The steering adaptor does fit it may give you some trouble but if you spread it open were it goes on the gear box it will help.
66548,0,"The installation was not easy although you would think it would be. The filters construction, the outer rubber sealing lip would not allow the air filter cover to close properly. I had to trim the outside edge to bevel it so that it would close properly, quite the hassle. On the plus side the bike runs better and for sure gets better gas mileage about 3-4 mpg. 2005 Suzuki C50T."
152451,2,"While the price is cheap, you really do get what you pay for!!! While this may be OK for Home use once in a while, that's all it's good for. For Comparison, a real 1/2"" Air Gun like a Snap-On MG725. 1,190 ft. lb. (1,613 N*m) of Bolt Break Away Torque! 810 ft. lb. (1,094 N*m) of Recommended Working Torque!!! Let me tell you, makes a HUGE difference. Not only that, but holds up for a very long time, until you have to get it rebuilt. The Snap-On is also lighter in weight!!! Then again the Snap-On is $400 or so. I've used a few Chicago Pneumatic tools in the past and they were JUNK!!! Snap-On tools are also MADE IN AMERICA!!!"
95889,1,"Picked this up for my 2012 Busa. Great fit, simple change out, K&N quality. Around town theres not much difference felt, but once you hit the open road and un-wind the bike, you can totally feel the difference.....great product"
161399,1,"As far as I know Eagle does not even make a small oiler anymore. This dutton goldenrod is made in USA and it works. No leaks around any seams or in the flexable spout. Could it maybe be a little better, well maybe but that is being very picky with an oiler. I have only had mine for a few months but I do not have any reason to think it will fail.On the other hand, prior to buying the dutton, I bought another brand, can not remember the name, it was blue and made in china. Wound up in the trash.You will not likely have any problems with this all metal, usa made oiler.Dutton does make a more expensive heavy duty goldenrod 16oz oiler. Model # 120-63. It costs more but if you want top quality."
74487,1,Exactly as advertised. Best price. Speedy shipping. Bolts a little long for stock application but acceptable. Would purchase from this manufacturer again.
24925,0,"I just received this for my birthday. I've always wanted it but just couldn't justify spending the money for something purely cosmetic. My stock leather shift know was starting to get a little worn, so I put this on my wish list. I know it says it only fits to 93, but I put this one on my 02 anyway. Installation was straight forward. I noticed that the provided isolator seemed rather skimpy compared to the large chunk of rubber attached to the stock shift stick. The holes in the shifter stick are much smaller than stock, so I used what came with my kit. I reused my stock shift boot and just bolted this in place of the stock stick. After 20 minutes I had it installed and was adjusting the position of the cool white shifter knob. Pleased with myself, I decided to row it though the shift gate and I immediately noticed that the shifter was much longer. After driving it for 2 hours, I decided that the long stick just looked goofy and the longer throws were bothersome. All minor annoyances, but the biggest problem was that the new shifter stick acted like a amplifier of every noise that was going on in the transmission. Down-shifting was the worse part. Also noticed that if I rested my hand on the shift knob, the sounds got louder. I experienced none of these things with the stock setup. Determined to keep the shifter and knob, (if the new knob would fit the stock shifter stick, I may have gone that route) I decided that this piece could be salvaged using some tools and some parts off the stock shifter. First thing I had to do was shorten the knob height, since it was now half way up the radio. (You fox bodied mustang owners are probably used to a shifter in the way of the radio) I took the knob off and used a 3/8 - 16 die and cut as many additional teeth as I could into the shift stick, until pieces started chipping off of the die. I was able to add an additional 1/2 inch of threads to the top of the stick. I screwed the knob back on and got lucky that it bottomed out on the threads and the shift pattern could be read. Since the jam nut increases the knob height buy about a 1/4 inch, this modification brought the knob down 3/4 inch. It doesn't sound like much but it makes a very noticeable difference. Next was the sound and vibration issue. I removed the shifter stick from the car, and using the stock shifter as a template, I elongated the holes of the hurst piece until the stock rubber isolator would fit. This took about 2 hours of drilling and grinding with a dremel tool. I'm sure a carbide bit on a die grinder is the way to go with this, but I didn't have one. I also offset the holes so that the shifter would angle slightly towards the rear. Its a lot of extra work, especially for something purely cosmetic, but if you want the look but want stock Noise/vibration/harshness levels, this is what you have to do. Since it can be modified and since it looks so damn cool, I gave it 3 stars. If I had no fabrication skills, and had to live with it the way it is bolted to the car, I would have given it 1 star. Granted it wasn't designed for a 2002 mustang, but I've owned a fox body car and know that the interiors just aren't THAT different. Bottom line, it looks cool, and with some basic skills, it can work well too."
2492,0,"This steering wheel cover looks very good. It is exceptionally easy to install. I am not sure how durable it will be, but so far it seems pretty good. If you have small hands, it may result in a steering wheel that is too big around to be comfortable in your hands. It is fine for me, as I have big hands. Not so good for my wife. I would not recommend this for someone with small hands.JACK"
109786,2,"Imagine wrapping your steering wheel in vinyl contact paper. Ya know that sticky feeling? That's how this feels. Yes, it's smooth, but your fingers sort of stick to it because it's such smooth vinyl. And when it's hot, it's even worse. I bought this yesterday, today it was returned, and I'm now shopping for something with a bit of texture to eliminate the sticky feel. Good luck!"

25983,2,Product said it would work on my 2008 Ford F150. I purchased two of these remotes and after programming them to my pickup one of the remotes would lock the doors every fifth or six try but would never unlock the doors. The other remote did the exact opposite. It would ocassionally unlock the doors but would never lock them. I did take them both to work and programmed them to a 2004 Excursion and they worked flawlessly.
1389,2,"This charger appeared to have a lot going for it, but appearances can be deceiving. When it arrived the insulation on the charging wires was not inserted in the fuse holders, so I had to buy new holders and replace them to avoid the hassle and expense of sending it back--it is very heavy at 21 lbs. For a while it worked charging both batteries in my 27' sailboat, but it is incredibly noisy (a 60-cycle hum you can hear outside the boat with the cabin closed up), so loud that you can't sleep in the boat with it on. After a few months it stopped charging my house battery, giving a flashing red LED (check battery) signal. Fiddling with it would, sometimes, and randomly, allow it to charge the battery. Then after a year it stopped charging the start battery. I thought my batteries were toast, as I gave up and stopped even turning it on recently. The Guest 16102 I replaced it with is completely silent, and went straight to 'float' charging my batteries (it turns out they were almost fully charged by the engine's alternator on a recent long trip), even though the Schumacher showed flashing red LEDs for both output circuits, i.e. check (dead) battery. This was a waste of money, and the worse kind of product, one that works for a while and then stops working when the warranty has expired."

15711,0,Bought these because I also bought the Thule Sidekick storage for my van. No where in the description did it tell you that the locks came with it and it had on the bottom of the page that the people that bought the Thule also bought the Locks so I got them and didn't need them because they came with the Sidekick. Didn't go to the trouble of returning them.

123196,2,"After reading many of the user reviews on this product, I thought I was making a great decision buying these. I ignored the occasional negative review and paid a good deal of money for what I hoped was a superior product.I installed them (easy) and got to use them a week later at the first light rain. They were perfect! For about the first ten minutes... After that short of a time, I instantly noticed a hairline streak on the driver's side wiper. Then a few more hairline streaks just began showing up out of the blue. I even pulled over to visually inspect the blades to make sure no debris was on them. They were simply bad, bad wiper blades that had begun deteriorating rapidly after their first use.I would not recommend anyone buy this particular brand of wiper. I havent tried competitor's brands of the same ""no frame"" wiper style, but certainly there is something really wrong with Bosch's rubber.Today I still have them on because I simply cannot justify replacing them so soon after how much I paid for them. So I grumble and moan everytime it rains and squint my way through the dozens and dozens of hairline streaks that have shown up to date. But it will be a happy day when I finally can take them no more, throw them out, and return to the normal wiper blades we all know and love."
53186,1,"and also appears to have increased the power of the car a little. This is very preliminary of course and subjective as I don't have a way of measuring this. The idle roughness problems I have at startup have not gone away. Common sense tells me that this system will not clean all parts of the engine, and using this product is not a substitute for replacing your spark plugs, changing your air filter, oil, and transmission fluid, among other things. I guess changing the air filter/spark plugs were the two things that seemed to have increased mpg/power the most in my car. This additive seems to have helped a little bit. I have a honda accord, btw, as a car. Maybe this formula works different on different cars and also depending on how much sludge you have built up in your fuel injection system. Admittedly in an accord, it is almost darn near impossible to change the fuel filter. I think I'll try seafoam next. Supposedly you can clean out other parts of your system that way."
157124,0,"The original Mr. Clean AutoDry Car Wash gave me 4 washes. I have to say that I dry the car with a micro-fiber cloth after using the system. I am pretty picky about the water spots and Mr. Clean did not quite do it as well as I can do with micro-fiber towel. It left a bit of spotting especially on the glass and chrome parts. And I enjoy drying the car with a towel, and lets me check for chips or any areas that might need claying.I do like the water gun and the delivery of the soapy water to the where I where I wash because my car is tall and I have to stand on little foot stool to wash the top of the car, this lets me stay up on the stool without running to the bucket with soapy water. So after the initial cartridge ran out I bought a refill.Warning: The water gun with the soapy refill is relatively heavy. Since I began having back problems, followed by back surgery I find it uncomfortably to use it due to weight. However, I hope when my back improves I will be able to use it again. If you have back problems keep the weight of the unit in mind when you deciding on the purchase.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called ""Online Price Alert"". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on ""online price alert"" in Google it will be come up at the top.

106083,1,"This is a fine filter, probably one of the best. Naturally it fits, that's how it was manufactured. I do have a little problem with oiling the thing though. It is hard to not put too much oil on the filter when cleaning and using the ""oil-in-the-bottle."" It takes forever to drip out to the point that you can install it and then not suck oil into your engine. I am going to get the spray-on cleaner kit and hope that works better next cleaning. It's a little pricy but hey, it is more than likely the last air filter you will ever need to purchase."

95316,0,For the price it's an OK buy. I honestly expected it to be a bit more sturdy especially being that Reese is a brand name I felt I could trust for quality. When it is not being used it seems a bit flimsy. When in use it leans a little from the weight. I would have expected that the swivel would be much tighter. For a light Jon boat it will probably be fine. Of course I was shopping for price and I got what I paid for.

The product (which has a powerful chemical odor) did a fine job of dissolving these. You need to use the sponge (included) and apply the product liberally, almost soaking the spots first. But with elbow grease (ie lots of rubbing) they vanished with no apparent harm to finish. I did notice a light film of the tar spread around the stain so it was necessary to wipe down these areas with Windex to completly remove the tar and the residual tar/remover.

But the good part ends here. After driving about 100 yards the right rear chain on my truck came apart and went flying. I picked it up but it was no good. About 70 miles down the road I lost the right RV chain but this time I wasn't so lucky, it ripped the wires apart from my slideout and wrapped around the axle. I managed to get it off (in the snow)but had to use wire cutters. Just as I was running out of snow and ice, the left chain on my truck came apart and wrapped around the axle. I was so lucky, I was able to remove it okay. With only 10 miles to go, I tried to make it with the last chain still on th RV, but one strand of the cable pulled loose and took out my clearence light. Easy to install was the reason I brought them.

I was a little disappointed at first getting ground service as a prime member, but overnight beats 2 days and their fullfillment centers are across the usa so chances are you will get yours in 1-2 days by ground ups.I have used Optima batteries since I killed my first battery in my H1 humvee offroad in Alaska doing 60 MPH over rock roads from the Yukon territories to Alaska. Ordinary car batteries just don't do well to the vibrations the H1 hummer can produce. Additionally when offroading, the H1 may tip up to 40 degrees on sideslope which will spill the acid out of a normal car battery while the optima does not loose any acid or liquid at all.You *MUST* match the color code of the optima battery with YOUR intended purpose as follows:BLUE (this one) - DEEP CYCLE applications - RV's, inverters, UPS systems basically applications where you plan to drain the battery dry every time then recharge it pretty soon afterwards.YELLOW (what I use in the H1 Hummer engine) - Has both deep cycle ability and engine starting ability. If you drain a NORMAL engine starting battery dead you take between 5-10 percent of its life away right there. The Yellow Optima batteries can take deep discarge running lights and accessories with the engine off and still start the engine then recharge from the alternator provided they are not totally dead. NOTE: if you use the side post for engine starting, ALWAYS connect a winch to the top post. Look closely and you will see that there is a slim bar that makes the side terminal FROM the top post, which is the main terminal. Because a winch will draw 200+ amps for minutes at a time, the top post is advised by optima for this and any heavy, long running loads. Engine starting is brief (4 seconds) so the thin strip inside the battery is fine.RED - these are just simple replacements for engine statring ONLY - they are NOT meant to be deep discharged and will suffer a shorter lifespan if you do drain them. They still have all the benefits of the Optima design of being sealed, vibration proof, and spill proof.Hence for cars, I always choose Yellow tops, and for boats or RV's & UPS systems I use blue tops. Honestly I've never bought a Red top because I normally want a battery that can run accessories on a vehicle with the engine off for a long time.This battery is rated 75AH and I realize you can buy alot more AH in a deep cycle marine cell with liquid acid for less money. I have no concerns anchoring this battery down inside my vehicle because I know it will not spill acid if I accellerate or corner sharply or go off road. I know that the wet cell deep cycle marine battery will spill acid under many conditions - even just climate changes or charging rapidly.You get what you pay for in the Optima batteries. Considering Amazon does not charge to ship a 69 lb battery to you and does not hit you with a core charge it's not a bad deal to get it on your doorstep overnight or 2 days. All together it proved to be an excellent piece of my inverter system (seeXantrex Technologies Prosine 1,000 to 1,500-Watt Power Inverter #1000for the inverter I used)The optima battery can deliver high enough currents for the Xantrex true sinewave inverter to start an air compressor which is a difficult load to deal with. Other batteries I tried refused to provide the inrush current to start the compressor. The reason is simple - inside the ""6 pack"" of cans are rolled up lead calcium gelled acid sheets with LOTS of surface area, which translates into higher currents possible.Finally, there is a pamphlet stuck to your new battery on how to care for your Optima cell for charging currents on the D31M model. One of the cons of the Optima design is that they do not take equalization charges like wet cells do so it is best to maintain a constant voltage of about 13.6 VDC on the battery when you are able to to prolong its life. I keep mine on theCTEK Multi US 7002 12V Battery Chargerwhich charges at 6-7 amps and can also supply 6amps for items running off the battery when ac is available.This is professional gear and will deliver excellent results when used properly."

84601,2,Being a lover of Meguiars products it was natural for me to purchase this product for my chrome wheels on my corvette. After washing the car I sprayed this on 2 wheels at a time then washed them gently and the chrome looked great. As I was drying the car I noticed my drilled slotted brake rotors were totally discolored and spotted. They are zinc plated to prevent rust and they were perfect before washing. I have been sick about this ever since. Read the label later and there is a warning that this material is corrosive. Great time to find out. Who would have thought that a cleaner for chrome would dissolve a zinc plated rotor. Plain soap and water from now on.
33835,2,"I received this as a gift and it quit working within 30 days. I contacted the company for a replacement and although they agreed to a replacement under their 1 year warranty, I had to pay close to 50% of the cost of this thing to ship it back. I don't understand why I am made to pay to ship it back if they sold a defective product! At this point in time, it has been between 3 & 4 weeks since I sent it back and have not heard a word from the company on my replacement. I honestly have no faith the new one will work more than a month or two either.Stay away from this product and this company. The heater is garbage, the company doesn't fully stand behind the item as they make you pay to ship it back when it will break and their communication is non-existent. Look elsewhere and for something of better quality. I guess you get what you pay for with this product."

57324,1,"1995 Silverado K1500 5.7 Ext.Cab w/6' bed. Installed about 2,000 miles ago on all (4) corners. Work as advertised by damping uneven road surfaces by keeping all four tires firmly on the road. Currently running worn BFG long trail T/A's (6/32"" left on front tires) and these Gas-Magnums majorly improve turning by actually steering this large truck where I point it. Before these shocks the truck drifted through turns. Haven't taken off road yet.While a minor hassle installing on front end, (rears were EZ), these beefy 2"" wide shocks were definitely worth the effort because they honestly improve both my trucks handling & safety. Tough to find elsewhere at a better price too. Would buy again."

182282,1,"This product is great. The shipping was free, it came a day early, easy to install, and included directions. I'm only 16 and it took me, and about 10 minutes of my dad's time, about 2 1/2 hours to install and that includes a trip to town for a new drill bit. Hardest part was drilling to resize the hole. I had planned on taking off my grille-guard, installing the hitch, then reinstalling the grille-guard. However, it does not work with the grille-guard mounting brackets! I will be welding the mounts onto the hitch though. Only thing I have left to do is wire up the winch and give it a go this weekend. Once installed you will have to trim some plastic here and there, but nothing too bad. It's a great product and I highly recommend it."

181989,0,"I recently purchase this hose from Amazon.com, for my '97 VW Cabrio, and it does exactly what it should. The only issue I had was that the part of the hose that connects nearest the oil filter, was slightly too long and I had to chop off about 5/8"", to avoid pinching the 90 bend nearest the Water Pump/thermostat hosing. All and all after shipping it was about $25 cheaper than any other auto parts store I could find in my area. My only wish is that it had a slightly higher temperature rating, but as long as I don't overheat too ofter it should be fine."

After the first use it sagged when it was closed and got in the way while driving. I have had other ones before that were made out of some type of fabric, which was great. This is made out of some weird plastic material with a shiny outer coating. It seems to get very out and transfers that heat into the car. When it's 115 degrees in Pheonix, it doesn't help much. Not worth the trouble at all."

Pour about an inch or less of cream (yes the fat from cows) into a glass.Lower the probe half way into the glass. Does cream contain methane gas. I think not. Cow flaps do. Try other liquids. Think gases are coming up your waste drains. place it just above a sink drain.This toy tool detects any and just about every vapor, mist, fog etc. You can easily detect the Mercapton that natural gas is doped with with your olfactory senses (i.e nose)."

100998,1,"This was part of the restoration of my 1993 Civic Si. With over 340,000 miles, it still had the initial shocks. Surprisingly, when removed those shocks were in good condition. However, the bushings were not. There was also a bolt hole which had elongated. Together, that led to a sloppy suspension.I had these parts installed at a professional shop which does some racing prep. This is not a slammed setup for autocross or other racing. This is a very good and reasonably priced setup for slight lowering, less body roll on curves, and rather similar ride quality to factory (when new).On straight bumpy roads, the ride is comparable to a brand new Mercedes C Series. On curvy mountain roads, it's quite a bit of fun."
104526,0,"The bars were good, felt very solid. I made the mistake of thinking the bindings were included to attach the bars to my SUV. They're not included so had to return the bars and buy a full rack system. So would recommend the bars if you need only the bars (and would give them 5 stars)."

127131,0,"I use this for charging my RV batteries when running my generator. I have had poor results using the built-in battery charger for my older model RV. From research it appears the older charging units do not charge the batteries adequately unless charged for a very long time if ever. I have my RV permanently 'way out there' and needed a quicker charger when running my generator. I have had to replace batteries prematurely as a result. I installed this charger by plugging into a receptacle in the RV and semi-permanently hooked it to my batteries and disconnected the old charger. Whenever I start the gererator I get a 10 amp rapid charge and an automatic charge reduction as the battery approaches full charge. My battery does not overcharge and boil off battery fluid because of the automatic feature. I have been very pleased by how quickly the batteries are charged compared to the built-in charger. Three stars because the wires on the charger get very warm with the 10 amp charge and there is no 'on' or 'off' switch, which I dislike as the unit must be unplugged while charging unless the generator is shut down. I can switch to and use the 2 amp feature and quickly disconnect the charger for use on ATV's, motorcycles, trickle charging, etc. I recently started using solar panels and only need to use the 2 amp charging rate and generator to keep the batteries at full charge after excessive use of electricity."

This lifesaver saves time and money (time IS money). If it doesn't sit stable in your engine compartment, buy a folding step stool so the cables will reach. As an electronics technician I can tell you that the internal Lead-acid battery needs to be charged every 3 months in order to get 8 yrs life expectancy."
3973,0,I have had this item for about 30 months and the out side has bubbies from the road salt. They will probably need to be replaced with in the next year.

94159,1,"I had been using Techwax 2.0 at $10 per can. This stuff smells nicer but doesn't shine the cars any better. I suspect most of the raves come from those who didn't prep first before but preped when they used this stuff. If you wax your car twice a year most any good wax will work well, at least here in Southern California. One thing I did notice was that the car was much smoother and showed more depth where I preped it with the Zymol prep first. But where I just waxed as I have always done, I couldn't tell the difference in shine, gloss or anything else, at least visually. I don't know about protection either but it seems to me when the gravel falls off the truck ahead of you on the freeway no wax will stop the paint from chipping or window from breaking. My cars are dark metalliac red and Mitsubishi Ivory white. The paint is in good shape because I wax every 4 to 6 months."
116039,1,Expensive but works as advertised. Mounted on my Acura MDX quite easily. Went on a trip to Yosemite with family and friends and it worked great carrying a full-size and an umbrella stroller + other miscellaneous cargo. No issues at high speeds (~80 mph). Looks great too!
25024,2,I have a 6 year old premium bass boat trailer with 2 inch coupler and surge brakes. The tongue style is UFP. This lock does not fit snugly against the tongue...it angles away with a 1.5 inch gap. Someone could easily get a pry bar between the lock and the tongue. A thief may not remove the lock but they will seriously damage the tongue. I am going to get stuck with $13 in wasted shipping returning this junk. Don't make the same mistake!

64012,0,"The 3130b works on all vehicles with OCBII jacks. If you have an older vehicle with OCBI jack, you will probably need the adapters that come with the 3140 unit, which is the main difference between the two.The 3130 has the serial jack and uses a different software site than the 3130b, which has the USB 2 jack and uses the Innova.com website. I received the 3130b. The software registration instructions are poor. You have to do your registration on the Innova website, not in the locally installed software. The way you get to their website from the supplied software is to select the ""fix it"" link in the upper right hand corner of the software installed on you PC. The link is only available after your 3130 is pluged into your computer's USB jack and communicating. As of this writing, I'm unable to find the link to upgrade the software/firmware on the portable unit, if one exists.The error code library on the website, is incomplete at this time, but will hopefully get updated at some point. There are two report options for the software. The free report is basically a teaser to get you to spend $14 for a more comprehensive report, but does give you the basic information about the vehicle.I used the unit on my 2005 RAM. The initial screen showed no error codes, however when I selected manufacture specific (chrysler) error codes for the transmission, I got a P0012 code, which is a generic code, not manufacturer specific. I was unable to find that specific error code for any Chrysler products. So I really do not know if I have a problem or not.I was able to record live data on one of my other newer vehicles and view it in the locally installed software.The bottom line is that the portable unit seems to work, although probably needs a software/firmware update, that may or may not exist. The software and website is a little confusing, and the instructions are poor."

All this was, besides being too big for the car (actually I didn't mind this, I think I was sent the wrong size anyway) it was only a giant scratchy sheet with an elastic around the bottom; something that would not stand up well to New England weather/wind/storms. So with a little improvising, and after losing it once in the wind, I ended up cutting some holes in the sides of it and fastening the cover in the same way I had the tarps. It'll do the job, but I personally don't think it was worth the money."

35169,1,Advanced Tool Design Model ATD-5657 Deluxe Vacuum/Fuel Pump Tester KitI could not find a suitable Vaccuum gage for under hood use in Australia. I spent considerable time looking for a replacement product when my old unit was accidently broken.Many of the local bigger name spare parts and tool suppliers gave me a blank look when I requested a large dial vacuum tester.Can't express my delight enough when I found the ATD-5675 available ex the USA and then the jackpot was the bargain price if I purchased it from Amazon. Well done Amazon.Great price. Perfect replacement for my broken gauge at a killer price and it is very easy to read & use.5 Star product. 5 star price and service.Thanks Amazon.JohnM.

59203,0,"This was a slammin' good deal. This is a genuine Spectre part that came in the full retail sealed box. It bolted up perfectly to my Dana 44, and included the gasket as seen in the photo. Two important things to know: #1 The fill screw does not have a ""stop"" ring on it, so attempting to tighten it all the way causes the fill screw to fall into the diff chamber leaving no other choice but do remove the cover, drain the oil, retrieve the screw and start the whole job over again. Doh! Yeah, that happened. Major bummer. And, the original fill screw was a different thread pattern so I couldn't re-use the original. #2 A relatively minor problem, but the bolts were too long in a couple of the holes so I had to put extra washers in place. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning so you should probably have washers standing by in case you need them. The bolt holes line up so of course you could re-use your original bolts to avoid the problem, but then you'd have a nice shiny diff cover with rusty bolts. All aside, still a great deal for this item."

148104,0,"I searched for about a week on-line and at car parts stores for a refill for my 2009 Honda Civic EX sedan wiper blades but like others have stated, while the length is okay, the width is usually not, so the fit is never quite right. Then I thought to check with the parts department of my local Honda dealer and they had ones that fit perfectly and work like a charm (and at only about $6 each, the price was surprisingly affordable). The refills are only the silicone portion so you do have to remove the metal supports from the old wiper and insert them into the new one but the whole process is easy and quick taking only a few minutes. For the DIFM (do it for me) crowd, I'd be surprised if the dealer wouldn't perform the replacement free of charge. Plus, you usually can't go wrong with OEM parts."

104058,1,Bought these for my F-150. Easy to install. Bought them because my truck was always hot when I would go home for the day. Now I can crack the windows and because of the visors no rain gets in and the inside of the truck isn't so hot.

I created a new start-up company during a recent snow storm, we remove excess snow and ice from roofs, driveways, and sidewalks.Knowing shovels would not be adequate, I purchased 15 IceDozers in hope for more efficient workmen. I came to realize my men were coming to work with sore backs, blistered hands and shattered egos. My start up is now losing money because of this faulty product, it should really only be recommended for small houses.If you still wish to try your luck with this product, there is a modification that can increase your productivity. I found that taping/gluing a broom handle to the IceDozer will allow you more leverage while while scraping. None the less, be sure to know an accurate square footage estimate of the property you will be working on. I would not use this on a house larger than 3,000 square feet, or 4,500 if you are using the broom handle modification."

I had to pound it on the ground for a slight bend in the mounting ends of the hitch and now it fits.if the screws fit i would be happy.if there was not chip in the paint i would be happy.it fits i am happy and it looks great im happy.. but it would have had a 5 star is there was not chip in the paint and the screws fit.. i dont mind the hammering to make it fit snug...I dont want to go through the hassel of sending it back and waiting for a another ans spending another 3 house getting it to fit properly."

134216,0,This thing works and works well. It can take a beating. But what was disappointing is that it does not maintain pressure across all spray patterns. The wider you adjust the spray pattern the less pressure the spray has. Personally I do not find that useful so I had to get rid of it and go back to conventional type of hose nozzles that are not built as well. But at least the pressure stays the same no matter which pattern you use. Very disappointing!!

73142,0,"I believe this is a solid and well made product. The not so great thing about it is the inside diameter box tubing where the hitch goes into the receiver is not a very tight fit. It is a little big making it loose for the hitch to bang around. I've had and seen better fitted hitch to receiver attachments on other brands. I even thought maybe I needed the hitch that was made by Curt which I payed more money cause of shipping to Hawaii, I was wrong! and could have saved $33 and bought it from walmart!!The fit is just as loose as the older hitch I already had. So if Curt had used the right size box tubing with tighter fit as in hitch to receiver I would recommend this product! Now I am stuck with a loose fitted Reciever and Hitch!!"

179579,0,"Pros: Heavy duty construction. Large enough to avoid spills.Cons: drain spout is at a wierd angle so you need to make sure the container you are dumping into has a large opening. Don't care for rings at bottom, would prefer it to be smooth to make it easier to wipe down. (although these probably aid in rigidness)Was not able to find a drain pan with all of the features I wanted. This one was the winner based on size and heavy duty construction. A 4 star pan would address cons above and a 5 star pan would also include some sort of cover."

It heated up just fine when I plugged it in, and stuck right to the side of the oil pan just like it should. I do wish that the chord was slightly longer, then I wouldn't have to drop to my back and reach under the truck to put it on."

You must be too, if you're reading this.Over the years, I have tried all different types of wax, and they are all pretty much the same, in my opinion. Not this! The Collinite #845 is extremely easy to apply and even easier to remove. It's doesn't leave that powder residue that all other waxes seem to leave behind. The shine is great, probably the best of any wax I've used, and at 4 months after waxing my truck, the water still beads like I just waxed it. On top of all that, it is cheaper than most other waxes you can get at the local auto parts store.I have waxed 2 full sized trucks, an SUV, and a boat and have only used about half of the bottle. A little goes a long way.Since discovering this wax, I have decided to try some other Collinite products. They all work great, but my results with their other products are more in-line with other similar products from different manufactures. If I had to have just one wax, the 845 is absolutely the way to go. I can't imagine that anyone would be disappointed with any aspect of this product."

However, the front main hinge was damaged when I received it and I can not find any Thule contact phone #. I registered the product online with Thule and explained the situation, but they have yet to contact me about it to replace the broken part. I'm a little frustrated now because they don't have a phone # to call them and they don't respond to emails on their own website. If you're lucky enough to get the product unharmed then it would be great, but good luck getting any issues resolved from the company."

These just seem like there built cheap to me and at 1/2 the price this appears to be 1/2 the life too. Stiffer than other new belts Ive used in the past also. Only time will tell, but I would bet they wont go near the 80,000 miles my original Nissan belts got. I'll give it the nod for being quiet. If your looking for a cheap belt this is it. If long life is what your after buy an OEM if its for an Infiniti or Nissan there much better belts. Gates are great belts too.Update: Already had to tighten this goodyear belt twice,and its been on less than 1200 mi. Do yourself a favor and buy a gates. Once you put a gates on it never needs adjusted again. They are far more superior and the extra cost is so worth it because now I know this belt will be short lived. Just added to my cost. P.O.S."
122071,1,This is just what I hoped it would be. I customized it by cutting the corners of the lip closest to the tailgate and tucking it under the plastic trim piece that holds down the carpet. Nice clean look for my 1999 Jeep Cherokee.Geep

It took some time, about 40 hours to fully charge, but when I put it back in my car it was like I had a brand new battery in there. It was easy to use, very straightforward. The steady red light came on to indicate charging, then the steady red and blinking green lights to indicate topping off the last 20% of the charge, and finally the steady green light to indicate my battery was fully charged and ready to go.When I didn't get the blinking green light after 16 hours I called their help line and talked to a very courteous and knowledgeable rep.

This is a low cost item so I was expecting what arrived, which is obviously a budget item as far as materials go. It definitely helps improve the look of the seat in the old truck it's being used in though, so no complaints from me. The truck is old enough that it does not have shoulder restraints in the safety belts so the lack of holes for those restraints is not an issue either.The quality is worth the price as long as your expectations are realistic."

The instructions are spot on, they talk to the unused mounting holes in the frame being gunked up with dirt and road grime and instruct you to clean them before attempting to mount the hitch, they are correct. We took one of the old bolts, sprayed it with WD40, cranked it in and cleared the hole with it. Lastly be careful when you are tightening the new bolts, we started them by hand, hit them with the impact gun but did the final tightening by hand. The impact gun could shear off the nut welded to the inside of the frame and that's a repair that no one would like to attempt. Overall a great fit and a 15 minute job."

Before this purchase I had always used Suzuki filters and have the special Suzuki oil filter wrench. Unfortunately this filter looks nearly identical to the Suzuki item it replaces but the shape at the outer end is different and the Suzuki wrench will not work with it. And it is too small for many (most?) oil filter wrenches to get a grip on - I tried 2 different ones and ended up using a pipe wrench to tighten it the additional 2 full turns after gasket contact. (Using a pipe wrench on an oil filter is just oh so wrong!)This is no doubt a good quality filter, but I will probably go back to using the Suzuki part since it is not much more expensive."

To my surprise it was buring a quart of oil every 500 miles and geting 10 mpg. I had a few runs up to the Organ Mountains (shape of the moutains resembled someones pipe organ and traveled around the city and it was pretty steady.I was planing on a trip to the west coast but with so much oil comsumption and low MPG I was a bit freaked. I came across slick 50 in a popular science mag or some such rag and I figured I had nothing to lose so I ordered a bottle. I poured in a quart and immediately went from a quart of oil comsumption in 500 miles to a qt in 1000 and gas millage went up from 10 mpg to 12 mpg.My engine was worn in manager that the FTPE could fill and it improved whatever was happening with the rings and valve guides that brought on the loss of fuel economy and oil comsumption. It happened and maintained that range of performance all through the 8000 mile West Coast trip we took.So when I read people making Unequvitable TRUTH statements I'm reminded to tread softly myself, experience is relative and theroy is just that."

It stays in place well, as long as you don't turn the wheel while you're parked on it. (Duh). It moves maybe 1 inch during the week, so I just push it back with my foot. I marked where the corners are on the floor with a marker so I can always put it in the right place when it moves or when I hose it off. Go buy one, it's great, simple, and it works."
140618,1,"For the price, this product is outstanding! I used it the moment I received it and it worked like a champ. It saved me $70(USD) from having a mechanic look at the problem. Used the booklet to look up the part and with that information, I went to the parts store and picked up the part. Simple repair (thank goodness). Total price for repair to include code reader $115(USD). For dealer repair $189(USD). Glad I chose this gadget!"
124529,0,"This is a fairly neat gadget, but the accuracy is somewhat inconsistent. Three or four readings in exactly the same place within a few seconds of each other yield varying readings. If you're looking for a rough estimate of the temperature this will give it to you. If you're looking for accuracy, you probably need something else."
38293,2,"I bought the key ring for a Betty Boop fan, but when it came, I changed my mind on giving it. The metal ring itself was extremely tarnished and even though I know I had just purchased it, it looks too old and used to give as a gift. One day, maybe i'll use it myself. I give it 2 stars because Betty herself is fine, but it's purposeless and just another item in my junk drawer until i decide to use it. Not really worth the gas money and time to return it."
20206,2,"We purchased this Pullzall two months ago, and have used it about 5 times. It has a nice ""overload/auto reset"" feature to stop you from damaging it. it just stops if it is above capacity and gives you a red warning light. That worked fine for a while, but on the 4th or 5th time it started flashing all the lights, then they all went out. It now no longer works. I wouldn't reccomend this tool if there is any chance you are going to be overloading it."
149133,2,Tried everything humanly possible to get this thing to work with no success. Followed all instructions perfectly and went online to download alternate instructions for my specific GM model which still did not help.
144298,2,"I ordered the unit and it took 26 days to arrive. Assembly was straightforward and the fit and finish was fine. Hooked the unit up to a manual switch and it was underpowered for the house. After much effort, it was clear that the generator pumped out a solid 100 volts ac, not 120. It couldn't even run a handtool at full power. HMMM.... 10,000 watts, eh? Next came Porter Cable NATIONAL service. It took them 48 hours to respond and when they did, it was basically to say its not their problem -try the local service center to see if they fix generators. The local service place was more sympathetic, but that doesn't put power in your lines. I am probably going to be stuck lugging a 350 lb. brand new generator to see if they can find out what's wrong. I'll give the generator 2 stars on looks alone. But I would much prefer a generator that is useable and that has a service crew that is even minimally interested in helping. One way or another I will get this thing to work, but for something that costs over $2ooo, I would have expected a generator that had been inspected by someone other than me."
115801,1,Once your key starts fighting you to let the key in and out your already needing help bad. After just living with a stiff door lock for a while I got tired of it and decided to get some graphite so the insides don't just turn to nasty goo. Having no luck finding any locally it was Amazon to the rescue again. A tiny squirt and the lock is so easy you think some parts are missing.
77002,2,"I replaced my fuel pump with this product. After about two hours of run time we stalled out, the boat was not getting fuel. We had to be towed by sea tow. The diaphragm inside the unit was deformed and cracked. I tried to return the product but never heard back from them. I had to dispute the charges with my CC company. I ended up purchasing a mallory pump locally. I've had no issues since replacing with a mallory. The mallory locally did cost a bit more."
185639,0,"The Tourmaster/Cortech DSX denim motorcycle pants are what I was looking for to ride in the warmer weather. They are comfortable while riding since they seem to be more breathable than the padded motorcycle pants that I usually wear. Denim, though, can be really oppressive in the hot humid weather when you finally get to your destination.I find that the plastic knee protectors (which are removable) tend to bother me when walking around because the top of the protector hits the bottom of my knee cap unless I pull the pants way up around the top of my waist. In that case I take the protectors out."
160641,0,"works, but is super loud. Sucks when you got toddlers in the car, and cant hear them beacuse of the noise. Anyways, I drove threw the moutains with this and my board did not fall off, so I was a happy mom."
151893,0,"This kit comes with a lot of adapters and just about everything you need to do many jobs. The only downfall is the quality of the press itself. The metal seems to ""ding"" easily so when doing U-Joints, it is hard to get it to hold straight. All and all it worked just fine for what I needed it for and it should do the same the next time."
46647,2,"I follow the instructions, there aren't many, but it isn't reading anything. It is almost as if there is a piece missing. Most pressure gauges read by letting a little air out of the tire and that's not happening. Thank goodness it didn't cost an arm and a leg, because it is going in the donation bag and I'm getting a different one."
173992,0,It takes more than 24 hrs to dry. need more than a tube to do a job.
91547,0,It was a little bigger than I had wanted. Otherwise it was fine. My husband ended up using it as it was too big for what I wanted it for.
147768,1,Lots of storage space. Perfect for organizing all the trunk clutter. Stays in place quite well with the bottom velcro straps. Really pleased with the product.
22207,2,"Bought it. Installed it. Leaked for multiple reasons1. The swivel fittings on the hose didn't seal. Spewed oil. Cut those off and put on fixed barbs. OK. Another trip to the HW store and $10 more2. The spin on filter adapter cracked. Brass 1/2"" fittings into thinwall cast aluminum is not a good idea3. Spent $15 on another spin on adapter (thinking I just went crazy with the tightening). I barely got the thing tightened (maybe 3-4 turns in) and pop.......cracked4. Finally gave up and used the firewall mounted oil filter mount for my turbo. That has 1/2"" fittings and did not crack or leak or nothing....of course the wall on the thread is thicker.....duhCrap. Buy a kit with AN fittings. Not worth saving $50 for the hassle then end up spending it anyway on fixing the crap."
172945,0,I didn't really like this. I had a hard time getting it to stick to my dash and just didn't like it.
164401,0,"So, other than the fact that this cushion is overpriced by roughly 40 dollars, I can honestly say that it is a good product. I will rate the product alone. If you are not too heavy, this cushion takes some pressure off of your tailbone. Even though the cushion claims to be firm, it is not. If you are 200 lbs, get an extra-firm cushion. This one is useful for everybody under 180-190. If you are heavier, it will help, but nowhere near as much as you need it to if you have a tailbone injury, for example. But it is well-made. The cushion does not bend out of shape. The cover does not bunch up or tear easily or stretch out. A good buy if you can spare the cash."
19713,2,"I purchased two for both cars, still wondering how it works. I will purchase a larger one locally, one that I feel I can trust when needed."
141514,1,"Well, what can you say about oil? This is highly rated oil that works better on motors with a bit of wear and opening wear surfaces, which tends to reduce local oil pressures in the engine."

100672,0,"We had to return, the part did not match up to my husband's vehicle. We will try again to order."
160669,1,Will give a look of a brand new shoe. This product is much better than dr martens or other brand. atleast for me it is. you will love it.
49219,1,"Very spacious bag. Holds lots of stuff and fits great on my Chrysler Pacifica roof. I have Thule crossbars not the standard Pacifica bars, however the bag design will fit either way. The straps offer lots of room to reach the bars and tighten down easily.The longest part of setup is after closing the bag, is securing the extra strap to keep it from flap-flapping against the bag as you drive.The bag is waterproof! I have taken it camping and have driven thousands of miles with the bag in place. The only time i got water in the bag was when I opened it in the rain, and didn't see the puddle on the top before unzipping.My only recommendation would be to bring a collapsible footstool or something to give you that extra boost to get things in and out.I use this one:B&R; Plastics 101-6 White EZ Foldz Step Stoolit's small and folds pretty flat."
163320,0,If your car's paint is really bad and full of contaminants this may be for you. My car is kept really clean so the clay bar didn't really absorb much although it did turn brown on some parts of the car. The main reason I bought this was to try and remove paint overspray and the nastiness that gets into the paint at the bottom of your vehicle but it really didn't help that much. Guess I'm the exception to the rule but am definitely dissappointed.
178672,0,These silicone wiper blades last longer than conventional but do not wipe the glass as clean. I will buy them again because the convenience of not having to replace them outweighs the imperfect wipe.
137617,2,Purchased this unit for a road trip of appropx. 5-6 days cross country . the unit did fine the first 2 days and then completely quit working! I fully plan to return it as soon as possible. I would not suggest this unit to anyone!!

36074,2,I ordered 5 of these batteries less than 18 months ago and only one is still working. I ended up buying a new APC backup supply which comes with a three year warranty including the battery. I would not recommend these batteries for their short life.
11650,1,My Corvette convertible doesn't get out much in the winter so this is perfect for maintaining the battery and not having to jump it when I do get to drive it after sitting a while. Really like the simplicity and quick connect/disconnect wiring.
121713,1,"Fram PH6607 Extra Guard Passenger Car Spin-On Oil Filter, Pack of 1As for performance, this item works perfectly for a 2006 Subaru Forrester. The price is right and Amazon Prime is a plus. Highly recommended."
157546,0,Looks nice. Holes did not line up and needed to grind 2 to get bolts to fit. No directions but maybe not needed. Would be nice if manufacturer sent liturature with other products available for this bumper like a bracket for a winch or other lights.
54893,2,I bought this tach and the matching speedometer and the speedo is lit with regular indocent bulbs and the tach has built in led lights so when you turn on the dash lights you have two different gauges one with yellow ish lighting and one very white looks like crap called equus and was told o well pretty much so i would not buy again spend the money on autometer
69191,1,"I used to drive for a living, so I'm quite familiar with brakes and stopping vehicles and doing so safely. I'll never forget trying to stop a 50,000 pound earthmover in the service with bad brakes!!!!That was a heart jolting experience! Anyways, I got a reco to use these from a mechanic who worked for midas. midas was one of my companies customers, so we were already on a pretty friendly basis. He took his time to reco those brake pads cuz they had the best stopping performance for street cars that he knew of, and I'm on my second front set now, and I can say they do a great job stopping my honda accord and they never faded on me. They have a built in glaze breaker on the suface to break the typical smooth glaze that builds up from normal stop and go driving, so if you are a do-it yourselfer, you won't have to get the rotors turned to break the glaze, just install them and follow the break in instructions. I am very pleased with these, and will definitely get them again when I need new pads. [ FWIW, My rotors are after-market slotted and drilled type, but I forgot the name brand, and I got them because of the advertised better stopping power and had less chance of warping and so I bought them in late 2002 when the car was new, but I did have a bit of fading on them, so when I got the reco for the EBC's, from someone I trusted, I went for it and am very pleased. ] the car now has 99,000 and these are the 2nd replacement EBC green set I put on."
93937,2,I wish I had read the reviews. I was so happy to find the exact print I have been looking for that I naively ordered. It's bait and switch. You don't get anything close to what you think you are buying. Quality is poor and the print is generic. PLEASE DON'T ORDER FROM THIS SELLER EVER!
612,2,"I thought that this shade was too expensive, and was just like the cheap version that is also no good.

40345,0,Pump was a little difficult to get the rubber pieces back on the fuel pickup. Still not sure if it works yet. So I'm gonna give it a 3 star. Price was a definite good buy. My ECU burned up along with the pump going out. Had a short in the wiring. I repaired the wire and replaced the pump. Still waiting on the new ECU

17612,1,I ride a little 150cc scooter and the helmets i kept finding locally were either wider than my bike or too costly. Point of buying the scooter was to save on gas and it does; same reason whay I bought the Beanie Helmet. Not only is it DOT certified but it's light weight and not goofy looking like some half cut helmets. In Texas we really do not have to wear helmets if you meet certain requirements with your insurance and other things. But safety is key as I have already had a 10mph spill and walked away with road rash and have noticed that most of those on-the-cell-phone-suv-driving-housewives don't pay attention half the time thus my purchase. I went for both safety and style; and as stated before the price was at least half off from purchasing from any mc or scooter shhop locally. I ordered my helmet and before I knew it I had it as the trun around was that quick. Thanks Jafrum.
83006,2,"The red flashers on this thing work well but it is incredibly dim. My regular cheap-o flashlights are many, many times brigher than this. I'd be surprised if you could see four feet in front of you in the dark, and the spot of light is quite small. I would only use the red flashers on this thing; I'll have to buy another regular flashlight for the car to go along with this piece of crap."

64579,0,"I have used k&n got years. I have seen no improvements in power or gas mileage. I think this is a stretch to expect an airfilter to do that. Have not seen this on my cars, trucks either. I bought so I can wash. In long haul that is where you save money. I clean airfilters, oil change every 6000 miles. The fit was not there. I had to do a lot of shaving. To get it to fit...k&n I am disappointed in you guys not making sure it is a fit...it is the one you called for."
177418,0,"I have a 2011 Hyundai Santa Fe. I understand this is a universal floor mat, but I think it's designed more so for sedans or something smaller. It just doesn't fit my SUV's front floor all that well. There's a lot of space on the sides, usually where the sedan's trunk or gas tank release would be. That's why I feel like they're not meant for SUV's. You will definitely have to adjust and cut to your cars fit.I did not have that smelly problem some people have stated. Just in case, I aired my floor mats out in the garage for a night before I threw them inside. It seemed to help because I was nauseated by any overwhelming scent.These floor mats pretty much do what they're supposed to. I saw cheaper option at my local Costco and would actually have rather purchased those.Overall pretty satisfied because I didn't spend that much. Just wish they fit better."
174836,1,"I replaced both the left and right tail lights on my '97 Camry with these after the originals were damaged. They were a perfect fit, and bolted on easily.

Great easy replacement at less than half the cost of OEM from the dealership."
52122,0,"I was looking for a neat way to stow the trash in my car, which usually isn't any more than receipts, tissues, or an occasional soda bottle. The size is just right, fits perfectly right behind the center console of my Toyota Highlander. I love that the weight bag is included and it really prevents the bag from tipping over when I make a turn. However, I gave it 4 stars because the velcro isnt very ""sticky"" on either the lid or underneath the bag. I'm glad it doesnt tear up the carpet when I pick it up, but I feel that it can be a little more secure.*UPDATE*Ive barely had the bag about a month now and yesterday I noticed that the wire that runs along the top and keeps the bag open has poked through the fabric. By no means did I put this bag through unnecessary wear and tear. I'm the only one that is ever in the car. Really disappointed, will have to sew it up :/"
80997,1,I bought this for my wife's RAV4 Sport. Very tight fit. Now I don't cringe when the girls have drinks in the RAV.
15510,0,"I bought this shock for a Jeep Comanche with a rear-end modification that required a shorter shock than the stock application. I went to the Monroe website and carefully looked through the specifications pdf available on their website. According to the written specifications it should have fit, it did not. I measured it with a tape measure and it was several inches longer than what it was listed as. I contacted customer service at Monroe and was given a third set of specifications that neither fit the shock or Monroe's website. By this time I lost patience and took a tape measure with me to the local parts store and found a competitors shock that fit. I find it hard to believe that a company of this size can not publish an accurate specification sheet. If you need this for any non-stock purpose trust in a tape measure and your eyes not Monroe's website. In all fairness I also discovered that the other un-named shocks missed the published specs on about half the shocks I measured. The counter person at the store was amazed at the differences between published collapsed and extended lengths compared to actual lengths.If your looking for stock application please ignore this review as I am sure their are built in tolerances to keep you out of trouble."
25822,0,Great keyless devices. Unfortunately I needed one for a mazda 626 and these are for F150 trucks. Still would recommend.
95540,0,"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to ""real"" coilovers. Having said that, the package arrived without the spanner wrench to adjust the ride height of the shocks. I called Fabtech directly and they sent me another one, but made me jump through a few hoops to prove that I actually ordered a kit and was not just trying to score a free wrench. 2/5 for customer service on their end. The stickers they sent in the package were both damaged as well. Nothing says good quality in advertising like poorly made stickers.As far as ride quality, there is NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE between these and general replacement struts. I have had Monroe Sensa-trac, and the stock Blisteins on this truck and these do not perform any better than those do. Having said that, the Monroe struts are the cheapest... I would go with those."

140121,1,"I have owned a pair of these for about a year, after owning a couple of cheaper pairs, and what I have learned is that there are three basic considerations when buying booster cables. First, the quality of product that the manufacturer produces. Poor quality cables will fail on you and possibly do serious damage to your vehicle. These cables are very well made and reliable. Second, the gauge of cable. The lower the number the heavier the cable. Four gauge is nice and beefy, and will do the job for any passenger car or truck. Don't go for a higher number (and therefore less capable) set of booster cables. Third, the length of the cable. It is inevitable that you will eventually have to use these to start a car that is boxed in by a garage, trees, or other vehicles and you''ll have to reach the battery from the back of the vehicle. Twenty feet is the minimum length. Get 25 foot cables if you can."
164505,0,"Not much to say really. It only serves as a deterrent. It's bright and conspicuously attached to the wheel, which makes a possible thief think twice before attempting to break into your car. Well worth it for the $25 price tag! I also use a break lock which is more durable and more likely to stop a thief from actually stealing the car if s/he decides to break the windows anyways. However, as I said before, this wheel lock performs its job well as a deterrent."

41264,1,"I used this dent puller to try and remove the dents out of a refrigerator door. Unfortunately, it didn't work, but it wouldn't work on most fridges due to their metal-over-foam door construction, which I learned about only after purchasing this puller.That said, I was very satisfied with my purchase. I liked the heavy-duty steel-and-rubber construction. You could probably drive a car over it and it would not break. My only complaint was that the rubber suction cup left a thin film on the metal that you were trying to pull, which was a little tough to remove.I could see myself owning this puller for a very long time. It was more expensive than the others, but one of the best available on Amazon. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a dent puller that will last them for years. In this case, you really get what you pay for."
55409,0,"Champion (71) RC12YC Traditional Spark Plug, Pack of 1I ordered (8) Champion RC12YC spark plugs and received (6) and (2) with different numbers. Wasn't worth the expense to send two back for an exchange so bought a couple more at a local parts house."
104442,0,I bought this because I needed a power source to charge my camera battery in the car going from one shoot to the next. The Canon charger didn't fit into the unit when plugged into the ashtray power outlet. I needed to buy an extender to move the unit far enough away so I could plug in the charger. Once I did that the unit works fine and allows me to plug in my GPS without switching. Check the amount of space you have in the ashtray and make sure you have a place to store the unit when not in use.
23162,0,"The first time I used the equipment, the belt blew. Actually, it broke. I'm not certain if part of the blame is mine though, I believe I installed the belt correctly, however, it's also possible that I didn't. This isn't the first belt I've installed on this tractor/snowblower, and probably won't be the last."
71949,1,I always check the reviews before purchasing an item on Amazon and did so with this brush. I was amazed at the high quality of this brush and the size. This is a big heavy duty car brush with beveled sides of the brush itself. I have an SUV and this brush makes quick work of washing the car. I attached an old broom handle to the brush and I was on my way. A great brush.May 2012 I have used this brush for several months now and if you are going to wash your car buy this brush. Nice heavy duty and gets into those small little places where all those dead Floria bugs like to hide.
136831,0,"I had pretty high hopes for this bleeder... unfortunately I used it once and have since reverted to only using it in the initial stages of the brake bleeding. After I swapped out my lines, the vac made the job of pulling fluid back into the lines and the calipers pretty easy. However, after that, it's pretty useless. It NEVER gets a good seal around the bleeder nipple, thus letting air come in from around the edges. That makes it look like you still have air coming out of the lines, even when you don't."
154386,0,"I bought this to use on my 5 year old daughter's 16"" bike. It installed pretty easily. It works fine, but the spring it too strong for her to kick the stand to the up (stowed) position by herself. She has to use her hands or have me do it. I'm hoping the spring will loosen up after some time. Also, the rubber cap on the bottom falls off a lot. It seems it should be a tighter fit. The rubber cap is needed since we do bring the bike in the house as we do not have a garage."
139676,1,"The inflator works great. But after less than a year of once-a-month use, the cheap plastic hinge has broken on the cover that encloses the hose and accessories. The hinge is part of the entire molded case and can't be repaired. So buy this inflator, but handle that door as if it were an eggshell."
186410,2,"The seat fit the bike fine. Looked great. However it was a pain in my back side. The back rest created by the passenger seat dug into my kidneys. The seat dug into my butt. I felt two support bars that just tore me up. I am a big guy at 6'2"" and 290lbs. The seat moved my riding position about an inch forward. With the passenger seat on, I couldn't sit fully in the solo seat without leaning forward. I tried all adjustments I could. I purchased all stock bracketing to mount it, pulled my bags off, no improvement. My wife loved the passenger seat, she could ride for hours with no problems. I could not. After about 30 minutes, it was almost unbearable. I put 300+ miles on the seat and then rode it to work a week later. 17 minute ride caused back problems all day. I sent the seat back and will look to an ultimate seat or some other brand later."
88314,0,Everything is great beside there will be water leaking from the straps if you tighten it up on the handle. The problem can be solved if you tighten it up with the buckles that come with the product.

52428,0,This alternator was ordered to replace the Bosch alternator on my 1983 Mercedes. It came in a timely fashion and works well BUT it came WITHOUT the pulley! The picture shows it with a pulley and the product description does not mention it will be shipped without a pulley. There was a little slip of paper in the alternator box which said that because of a shortage of pulleys in the market place the alternator was shipped without a pulley. As it turns out I was able to re-use the old pulley (without having to take it to a machine shop to have it pulled off though the old pulley is actually about a ten [10] piece assembly which I hopefully got in the correct order) but NOWHERE in the product description does it say that the item will be shipped without the pulley (as it specifically does with other replacement alternators Amazon sells). Those are NOT surprises I enjoy finding out AFTER I have paid and had such an item delivered. When I go to a local parts store to buy such a part I know this sort of thing before I leave the store.

If you rush you will crinkle and have the film and clear cover sticking to each other giving you a head ache.

1306,0,"I've owned this about two years and its worked flawlessly. Its been used to keep three vehicles, three tractors, and two lawn mowers going through all the Minnesota seasons. I like the fact that it has an ""off"" setting. Its been very versatile and holds up well to fairly rough treatment. Would definitely buy again.EDIT 5/27/11:Very shortly after writing this glowing review, my unit seems to have died. I needed to jump a battery and pulled out the charger and let it charge for the normal amount of time. But battery was still dead. Repeated this process a few times and decided it wasn't the battery, must be something wrong with the truck, which is admittedly fairly old. Then noticed I wasn't getting a decent spark when i touched the positive and negative connectors together. Pulled out very old and frail charger that was nearly junked when I bought this Schumacher and it charged up the battery just fine. Upon further review, it appears that my Schumacher charger works only when in Manual setting, and does nothing when in automatic. I expect this sort of product to last more than two years."

89981,2,"Why is Slick 50 NOT Slick 50 anymore???Before 1984, Slick 50 was a one-time metal-infused treatment which coated your engine parts with an anti-wear lubricant film. The magic ingredient in Slick 50 NOW is Polytetrafluoroethylene. Don't try to pronounce it: call it PTFE. But don't call it Teflon, which is what it is, because that is a registered trademark. Dupont, who invented Teflon, claims that ""Teflon is not useful as an ingredient in oil additives or oils used for internal combustion engines."" But what do they know?PTFE is a solid which is added to engine oil and coats the moving parts of the engine.However, such solids seem even more inclined to coat non-moving parts, like oil passages and filters. After all, if it can build up under the pressures and friction exerted on a cylinder wall, then it stands to reason it should build up even better in places with low pressures and virtually no friction.This conclusion seems to be borne out by tests on oil additives containing PTFE conducted by the NASA Lewis Research Center, which said in their report, ""In the types of bearing surface contact we have looked at, we have seen no benefit. In some cases we have seen detrimental effect. The solids in the oil tend to accumulate at inlets and act as a dam, which simply blocks the oil from entering. Instead of helping, it is actually depriving parts of lubricant"".In defense of Slick 50, tests done on a Chevy 6 cylinder engine by the University of Utah Engineering Experiment Station found that after treatment with the PTFE additive the test engine's friction was reduced by 13.1 percent, the output horsepower increased from 5.3 percent to 8.1 percent, and fuel economy improved as well. Unfortunately, the same tests concluded that ""There was a pressure drop across the oil filter resulting from possible clogging of small passageways."" Oil analysis showed that iron contamination doubled after the treatment, indicating that engine wear increased.The bottom line is that outside of the testimonials of happy and satisfied customers and the guarantees of company executives about the wonderful effects that studies have shown will follow the use of their products, there isn't much support for using oil additives. Of course, there are those millions of customers who buy the stuff: aren't they proof that these things really work? Not really. They're proof that this stuff really sells!It's your money, but I think you'd be better off if you just changed your oil and oil filter regularly. And don't forget to change the fuel and air filters at the recommended intervals. I can't say for sure that these new products do no good, but what good they might do is probably not necessary or of much value for the average vehicle owner who takes proper care of the vehicle."
4497,0,"I liked the idea of having a code scanner AND a realtime diagnostics tool that looked good mounted in the interior of my truck. However, it took me a few times filling up the gas tank before mine would list 'realistic' HP and MPG's. It started out telling me I had around 400hp and was only getting 8-10mpg on my 2001 Tacoma. After the extra fillups, it's starting to read 20-24mpg and a realistic hp of about 150-185. The code scanner is great. I like being able to know in an instant that I get a code what it is, and then clear it. The instruction manual is a little vague, and detailed instructions on filling the tank get a little confusing, which meant a few extra minutes sitting in the gas station parking lot to get it set right. I have allready recommended it to others as a good digital diagnostics tool that looks good mounted in the vehicle."
29439,2,"GM used two types of cigarette lighter assemblies, a Casco and a Rochester and they are different design. The one I have in my 1991 S10 blazer is a Casco lighter assembly that has a replaceable element but this product does not fit the knob or the receiver. I tossed it and found a good used cigarette lighter knob and element on the internet. I don't smoke but I like everything in my vehicles to work wheather I use them or not.The GM service replacement lighters assembly are Rochesters and you must purchase the receiver and element/knob assembly separately. If you have a Casco lighter assembly, you must replace the receiver to install the complete GM Rochester service replacement lighter assembly. In most cases of an imoperative cigarette lighter, the receiver is not at fault and the element and knob assembly is toast. Never hold a cigarette lighter element in the receiver to get it bright cherry red hot. That will sooner or later blow the fuse, burn out the element or both."
79478,1,"This Luau Bucket Seatcover has added a whole new tropical look to my car. My old bucket seats were stained and some of the strains weren't coming out. What was I to do?So I came up with this low budget idea--seat covers! I did a search on Amazon and got better prices than on some of the auto supply web sites. I was so excited. While browsing the styles, I fell in love with this black style which matched my black car perfectly.The bucket seatcovers fit perfectly too. They also don't have those ugly and annoying backstaps on them. They are one complete pullover piece--much nicer look!When one of the children spilt something on the passenger's seatcover, I simply washed it in the washing machine and then put it on low heat in the dryer. No smearing or dye coming out like with cheaper brands.Since then I have purchased a ""coconut tree"" air freshner to match the tropical look along with a few Florida bumper stickers. Even though my car is black, I feel like it has a ""welcome summertime"" look.And yeah, when the radio plays Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville--I crank it up! But I don't drink and drive! I can experience at least the tropical references in the song and have a Margarita once I get home from work."

101382,1,"I am exceptionally pleased with this windshield. I used it recently on a 2600 mile round trip from Boston to Nova Scotia on my Kawasaki Vulcan 750. So easy to setup, it also caught bugs and kept the wind blast out. We rode in some heavy crosswinds too at highway speeds. When visibility was low as during a drizzle, I just sat up a bit straighter -- I am 5'7"" -- so that my nose was slightly above the windshield allowing me to see clearly but still not enough to be bothered by wind blast. Cleaned it off bugs with two swipes at a couple of gas stations. Sleek and stylish!"

162367,2,"This cowl hit on the top of the windshield wiper bolt, hit the end of the passenger windshield wiper, and blocked your vision going over a steep hill. This appears to be a one size fits all, certainly not an S10. I had to trim out to clear the drivers side hinge, and the hood hit it when raised enough to use the prop rod. There wasn't any good places to screw it down, as there were no places where it would be flat on the cowl opening. About all it is good for is sticking it on when out cruising and taking it off for going offroad, checking oil, or driving where there are steep hills."

Still it wouldn't start when needed during the Nashville flood 2010, had to get fuel line unclogged ($80). Power outage this month, and wouldn't start again. Reliable small engine shop tells me it's actually a Mitsubishi engine,....that B&S had some arrangement to buy engines from Mitsubishi. And the carburetor has gone unrepairably bad (after total of about 2 hrs run time!). Carburetor cost $250 from Mitsubishi, plus installation charge. No thanks. I guess I'll just live without an emergency generator"
113759,0,"The dash has warped and cracked in our old pointiac. I found this online and decided to purhcase. This dashmat is certainly cheaper than repalcing the entire dash!

50312,1,"I've used this for laundry both as a spot treatment and an additive and I LOVE it. Wish I'd found it years ago. I love to cook but hate those cooking oil spots that never seem to come out all the way. When I got this I tried it on a few things I'd just about given up on and had in the 'grungy clothes' (cleaning, gardening, painting...) pile. Many of them had been treated with other products and washed/dried numerous times to no avail. I was happily surprised when they came out clean and 'everyday' wearable again.Added bonus, my husband is a mechanic and overall car enthusiast as well as hobby race-driver, and his clothes get incredibly greasy. This is the first thing I've ever found that gets everything clean, and his work uniforms are even spotless after washing. I thought it was funny when I later saw a bottle of this in the garage and he told me he uses it all the time on car parts and the driveway... apparently it works well for those things, too."
3564,0,"Length:: 2:15 MinsHaving just purchased this product for an upcoming road trip, I was excited to give it something of a test run. I followed the instructions sheet completely that is sewn into the storage bag, but keep having a problem with the bottom pole frame not fitting together when sliding the poles through the sewn-in loops on the bag. The frame assembles fine when not using the loops. I've looked through other reviews and online, including the manufacturer's website, and cannot find this mentioned anywhere. So I wonder if there are specific instructions for this or perhaps I received a defective product? Other than this, which is a huge issue for me, it seems the cargo bag is just what my family and I need for our trip.Modified this today to add a video showing the basic problem with the bottom pole frame not fitting into sewn-in loops."

23140,2,"The only reason I am not putting this product as a 1-star because the product is actually good. However, 50% of the reason I bought this product instead of another manufacturer was because of the proposed rebate. The company is ridiculous because I send not only the UPC codes they require, but the entire box, and they send me a letter that they need the UPC codes. Obviously I don't have it because I sent it already. Try not to buy from Bosch. I already emailed and Facebook-ed my friends in case they ever buy something for their cars. Rebates are usually easily follow-the-instruction deals, but this is the bad side about rebates because companies can screw you over and there's no recourse for you."

142214,2,"I have had this unit for seven months, now. It honestly is just a cheap device, turned out cheaply, to cash in on the solar craze now going on. I'm all for great-quality solar panels that provide reliable energy. This unit does not. Yes, it reads fine on my multimeter, when I check it, but the battery on my RV is not staying charged. I have gone through two charge controllers, so I have to think that the panel just might be the culprit, here. I am in a city with almost 90% very sunny days. This panel gets full, blazing sun, just about daily, for seven hours. You get what you pay for, and you don't get much, apparently, at the price this unit goes for. My RV battery performs as it should when it is not hooked up to this unit. It charges and holds charge when I'm on the road. Again, it looks like a case of a badly made solar panel. Spend more for a better unit."

It is very easy to remove, clean and condition as needed. As far as performance I have not paid much attention to that aspect as the two reasons stated above are enough to sell me. If it improves performance, efficiency and longevity then that's a bonus."
39580,1,"Very useful. It really clears the air in the car. And you don't have to plug it in. The only draw back would be that it doesn't have anything to hold it to any part of the car, so it's better to put it on the floor so it won't move."

I did a lot of prior research because I get a lot of windshield time each and every month all over the Rockies. I'm on 24/7 call so I have to pick up and go no matter the time or weather conditions. These lights have been thousands of miles through all imaginable road conditions and they have not served me as well as I had hoped. The biggest problem is the curvature of the bulbs which allows enough upward light to render them useless in heavy fog or snow. Many times I've been out in heavy fog or blizzard conditions trying to optimize the lights positions so I could see to drive. I've never found a spot that really works. I paid a lot of money for a concept that sounds great but that fails to deliver. I've had no problems with the lights or the controls and after all this time the lights only exhibit light pitting on the lenses which I think speaks for the quality of the product. They are great looking on a bull bar and the plasma ion color is really nice but there's just too much light in the air and not enough on the road."

Yes, the arm part is chrome-painted plastic. The mirror wobbles when I drive over a bump. I don't think it would survive an encounter with an automated car wash. However, I can buy ten of these for the cost of one manufacturer part, so I'll just keep an extra around for the inevitable breakage.**UPDATE** I installed these more than a year ago, and they are still looking great! I've taken the car through automated car washes, and they've been subjected to high heat as well as sub zero temperatures, and they haven't broken!

It is especially advisable for using during the winter season and rainy season because it catches all the dirt and wetness so that your floor carpets are kept clean and dry all the time. It is certainly worth the investment and I highly recommend it.Fyi, I first went online to huskyliners.com and emailed the manufacturer to make sure this is a perfect fit for my car. They are very courteous and helpful, and they emailed me back within 24 hours. I suggest you do the same before making a purchase. Also, when installing these on your car, the liners actually have marks on them that tell you which one goes to the passenger side or the driver's side of the car. These are supposed to make a PERFECT fit on your vehicle so if you find that it doesn't do that then you either purchased the wrong kind or you installed it incorrectly. You need not worry though (if you purchased the wrong kind) because Amazon.com has an excellent, customer-friendly returns policy."

The best price I found at Amazon was a bit lower but not what I'd call a bargain. The item arrived in the original packaging but the box was dirty and stained. A section of the pleated filter media was a deformed and folded over as if it got crushed. I fussed around with it for about 10 minutes and was able to get it acceptably back into form. If I had purchased it locally, I would have taken it back. While I would definitely go with the AC-Delco brand filter in the future, I'd go with a different seller."

One unit wouldn't close all the way when you put a DVD into it, and the other one kept freezing while my daughter was watching a movie. Every time it would freeze, it would not only freeze the movie, but all the buttons on the player and on the remote. We had to unplug it and start the movie over. We even tried 4 other movies to be sure that there wasn't a defect with the DVD. No, it was the player. Not to mention the remote didn't work well unless it was practacally touching the player, it also would take a rocket scientist to figure out the remote. There are 39 buttons on the thing. Please don't waste your money on these players. The price may be good, but we learned our lesson. You get what you pay for."

I used it on my Simmons 2 piece alumminum rims. It did remove some of the initial oxidation on my rims, but did not by any means bring them to complete finished shine. You will still have to use you hands and elbow grease to get a finished shine. The PowerBall won't reach in corners and edges, it is best used on flat surfaces. I used it with a cordless power drill, it might work better with a corded drill.All in all it is ok for the initial step in polishing. The powerball seems sturdy, it hasnt torn apart as of 4 hours of use. Wish is was a little cheaper maybe $10.00."

115144,1,Does everything a sparkplug should do for a good price. I used this in my 1999 Honda Fourtrax 300 4x4. Shipped quickly.
119588,0,"The price is right, and I finally got one that fit and wasn't beat to pieces, but it took 3 tries. The first one showed up half out of the box with most of the paint chipped off the edges/ends, and it was bent so that the bolt holes wouldn't line up. I don't know if it was bent during shipping (it's heavy duty) - but it was tweaked enough that it wouldn't go on. I returned it and requested a replacement. That one got lost in shipping. I canceled that one and requested a replacement (number 3), and that one showed up in OK shape, and it bolted up. Then the second one showed up a week later (a month after it was originally ordered. It wasn't in the box, and it was really banged up - 20% of the paint was chipped off.The hitch is OK and is easy to install, but the way they ship them almost guarantees it's going to get banged up. In Minnesota this means it's going to start rusting the first winter. I touched up mine with a rattle can before installing.I've ordered a Draw-Tite hitch in the past, and it showed up wrapped in plastic in perfect condition, if this hadn't been such a good deal I'd have canceled after the first one. For the price I'm happy - but it took a month to get it. They really need to look at how they ship these - an 80lb piece of steel loose in a cardboard box doesn't work."
24076,1,"I read a study somewhere that said Wix filters are among the best for small particulate filtering, while still allowing excellent airflow. The price was right and easy to install in my S2000."
122145,0,"Look and function well, and looks like a factory install. The mounting hardware required modification as the supplied hardware left lights 1/2 inch behind the bumper. I added a longer bolt and a couple of nuts to allow more forward backward adjustment. all in all the kit is very complete and reasonably easy to install, directions could be better such as exactly what size hole saw should be used to cut holes (I used a 4"", but 3 7/8"" or 3 15/16"" would have been better)in the bumper and what color wire you should tap into to switch the relay."
133079,0,"They fit the seat okay, the order also came with some arm rest covers but my Titan does not have armrests? There is no cover for the center box as shown in the picture but it is not listed in the description either so whatever custom..."
100089,1,"These mats seem well made and are a nice fit in my 2001 Saab 9-3. My main complaint is they didn't come with the eyelets as pictured. My car is outfitted with the posts for the eyelets and for as much as these cost they should include the eyelet holes. They seem like quality mats and time will tell. They fit well but i wouldn't say they fit any better than factory mats (as advertised), especially without the eyelet holes. The color (beige) is close to factory but a few shades darker. Overall I am pleased with these mats; I think they are a little pricey though, given I will have to install my own eyelets."
92564,0,"I bought this for my Volvo 240. I gave all the required information about the car, but the wiper does not fit onto the wiper stem. So, I am disappointed. Since the part was shipped to my girlfriends house, I did not get a chance to try to install it for a few weeks. Too late to get my money back for a part the does not work. 3 stars. Good wiper arm, but better if it fit the car."
175191,1,These steps were a fantastic deal! They mounted fairly easy even though there were no directions. (There probably are directions usually). The job was easy with a large breaker socket bar. Shipping was fast. Only wish there was a center bracket but the steps are solid and look very sharp on my 2011 EXT cab Silverado. Very satisfied. Amazon is fantastic!! These steps are a great product. I purchased steps earlier that were the wrong size and Amazon was super with the return.

136541,0,"It looks nice, fit and finish is better than average, and it howls under the hood when you're wide open at higher RPM.I haven't noticed any mileage increase or discernable power increase however.Did I mention it's really, really loud?"
74516,1,Got this for my son for Xmas and he loves it for his new truck.. Has a real chrome look to it. Ball fits great and it fits in the tube nicely ...
64148,1,This item is great if you already have the Mr Clean Car wash product. JH
156141,2,"As noted by a previous reviewer, the package contained only two screws. There are clearly four screws in the Amazon picture and the instructions tells you to use 4 screws. You'll need 2 additional screws to mount this bracket!!"

167634,1,"Good sensor, and amazon had the best price. It was very easy to install on an Acura RSX with a sensor socket (sold separately and highly recommended). Check engine light has been off ever since, and my RPM's no longer fluctuate oddly at idle like they used to. Seems like my MPG improved as well."
125779,2,"This looked like a great product for my purpose. However, upon receiving the product and reading the instructions I learned that it does not work in all cars. When you turn offthe ignition it may also turn off power to the cigarette lighter socket. I had to callthe dealers of my cars (Acura and Mini) to find out that there is no power at the socketonce the ignition is off."
4924,0,"The mirror comes with very ordinary peel and stick foam for a water seal.Just took a 500 mile trip. This mirror vibrates much more than the factory mirror.It is not a problem with the install, this vibration is the mirror shaking more in its shell than the factory mirror."
140812,2,"I bought this for my Smart For two, but it was a complete waste of money, since the sticky hooks don't stay put, even when there's nothing on the trunk forcing them. I'm not willing to put super glue on the car, so the product is useless for me. If I had hooks in the car, it would be different, but it's not the case. For me, not a good product."
31245,0,"I bought this to help protect my kids from direct sunlight streaming into their eyes. It does the trick and helps diffuse the light while not blocking my view and affecting safety. The suction cups stick pretty well and only occasionally do I need to readjust. My only complaint is quality, because the mesh began to rip away from the corner edge pretty quickly (without any rough treatment) but otherwise, it works fine and has been nice to have."

80672,1,This product worked as described. It fits in my 98 minivan. Can't complain because it is cheap. Would buy again
107209,2,I ordered this product in January and it is now late april and I have yet to receive this item or my money back from the seller. When I ordered the product it said it was in stock. It is sellers like this that make people feel uneasy about shopping on the internet.
167326,1,"Rear driver side window of my mother's 2000 Buick Lesabre fell down one day and could no longer be rolled up. The dealer estimated at least $400 to fix. So I opened the door panel up and found it was a broken cable on the window regulator (which appears to be a very common problem on Buicks of that time). This piece as an exact fit replacement. While the OEM part alone would have been $150 from the dealer I was able to fix it myself in less than a half hour.If you're looking for instructions on how to do it just search it on google. I found a couple videos on youtube alone, though you could probably do it just fine on common sense alone. A really quick synopsis-- you have to first remove the inner door panel with a putty knife or something, unhook all the switches, have someone hold up the window while you unscrew the glass and old regulator, pull the old one out, toss it, screw this one in, plug the wire in and replace the trim. Quite simple, 30 minutes and over $300 saved. The only tools you'll need are a socket wrench, screwdriver and something to pry off the inner door panel.Another added bonus is the window is now quieter and rolls up down faster than the old one. Looking at the new and old regulator side by side the materials and workman ship are identical, so I would not worry about the quality. You can also buy this piece without the motor but since it was only a few dollars difference I went with the whole thing-- its better than having the motor go out a few months later and replacing it again."
60969,1,"Works great as a throttle depressor for cleaning throttle bodies or keeping engine rpm set where you need it. I also commonly use it as a brake peddle depressor to check brake lights by pressing the back of the handle against the front of the seat. It may not be quite sturdy enough for much more than checking lights, but for that it works perfectly. I use it nearly every day and it hasn't failed me yet!"
87858,0,"What can I say? It's 100% silicone dielectric connector grease. If you're buying this then you know what that means and what to expect. I received exactly what I expected, but HOW I received it was a bit of a problem. Why? Well, this was the only item I bought from the vendor and the vendor shipped it in a soft-sided bubble pack -- probably to reduce shipping costs. Now when you take a metal tube filled with 3oz of grease and ship it in a soft-sided container, what do you think happens? That's right -- SQUISH. Fortunately the tube I received was only split at the base; if it'd been split anywhere else (can you say middle of tube?) it'd have been a bit messier.I feel it's a 5-star product at a 5-star price -- but the lack of thought that went into how it was shipped is why I've given it a 3-star rating. This could have been much, much worse (grease all over the inside of the soft-sided pack ... and none in the tube); the vendor needs to think about these things before sending tubes of grease packaged as it was."
124267,2,They got it wrong but there is a better solution go to auto zone buy a big truck mirror - trace out exactly the outline of your old mirror go to a glass shop and have them cut the mirror and they may even attach it to your car with some silicone and tape after it sets you can take the tape off..!!
30320,1,The impact driver seems to do everything I expected it to do and more. Good transaction.

48095,1,"I bought this for my 2002 S2000. It's been a few weeks without any problem. This was the first time I've done this myself. I did not remove the airbox, so it took some maneuvering and got some superficial abrasions as the result. It certainly is a doable DIY job."

173303,1,"This tool is a ""must have"" in changing the spark plugs in an F150 with the 5.4 Triton engine. If I had not pruchased this tool, I would have been spending a considerable amount of additional time just fishing out the regular socket from the spark plug cavity since there is a tendancy for the socket to pull-off or separate from the extension. I have also experienced breaking the porcelain section of spark plugs by using regular spark plug sockets that have the rubber boot. This tool did not break a single plug and I recommend it to anyone that is going to perform this task themselves.Well worth the money!JBBTulsa, OK"
32365,2,"This cover does indeed fit Jeep TJ Wrangler models. It's pretty easy to get on and off.That's the main problem. Even with the security cable attached and strapped down tightly, this cover blows off the car too easily.This cover has spent more time off my Jeep than on it due to the fact that even slight winds can blow the cover off. I don't live in a particular windy area.As for functionality as a cover, it seems to be good at keeping the elements out, when it's still on the car that is."
24448,1,"Fits well, affordable, does what I need to too to keep safe when I ride. I have no complaints this was a good purchase"

6355,2,"I am sorry, but a company with a name like Iron Horse should not be selling crap from China. This exact helmet can be found by street vendors, vendors at motorcycle shows, etc. Not too many good products come out of China and this is one that doesn't make the list. Vendors who sell these pay less than $10 a piece for them in bulk. This isn't an ""Iron Horse"" product."
48747,2,I purchased the Black & Decker AS1300 air compressor. The built in gauge didn't work. It was about 20 pounds off.

6474,0,"The LEDs are nice and bright, installation was very easy with the 3M adhesive pads. It would have been more convenient to have the reverse wire included in the trailer plug, but tapping into my reverse signal wasn't an issue.After a couple of weeks, I noticed the 4 leftmost red LEDs started to have some issues. Sometimes they would be on full power with the parking lights, sometimes they would seem to be about half power, and sometimes not on at all. Moisture had gotten into the end of the bar even though it seemed to be sealed pretty well with silicone. Those LEDs function fine with the brake or left turn signal though which is most important. I couldn't get a response from Rampage customer service, so I've just dealt with it."
60674,0,"Good design, low cost and nice finishing. Light is adequate. Key release tends to get stuck open randomly and drop key rings. Had to tape it shut."
105411,1,Very happy w/the product and the shipping service. This filter sells for more at most other sights. Would reccommend this to people I know.
187510,2,"Bought this product on September 2011 and as of date(Dec. 22, 2012) it has broken down. It was great while it lasted. I never, exceeded the 10minute period that they stated, it usually takes me 1 minute or less to top off a tire. It does the job quickly, while it worked. However, today I tried to top off my tires and it died on me. If you want to spend 60 dollars, try to find something better and will last longer."

179053,0,"I repaired a small chip in a formica table top and it did an OK job. You need to have an eye for mixing the colors to blend in with the material you're trying to repair. Not sure how this product would work on larger areas. Color portions are small and there will probably be some colors you won't use. Be sure to cap partially used portions immediately, as it drys out. Overall, I'm satisfied with my small repair."

24715,1,"I had a few deep scratches on my bumber. I was told that I would have to get insurance involved but it cost too much to fix, so I bought four of the paws and used them to cover the scratches and it looks great. Saved myself over $490 dollars and I love dogs to boot..."

42854,0,"Yep, even though the picture shows black mats, it's tan. The original size was slightly too big for my compact car, but the rubber material cuts very easily, so it was not a problem resizing them. Had to make some major cuts to the driver's side mat to accommodate the gas pedal though. Again, no big deal. A minor flaw is that there does not appear to be too strong of a grip to these mats. This is fine when it the front ones fit pretty snugly, but the rear ones will probably slide around with all the foot traffic. All in all, still recommend it."
20924,1,Got these to replace crappy Smittybuilt neoprenes. So far so good. Heavy duty. Will have to see how they are when summer comes and the top comes down. Could get hot when the sun shines on em. They are more vinyl than the spongy neoprenes. Will report back.
76664,0,Its a three star just because one side of the suction wont stick on the glass. It still holds my ezpass thou becoz of the other 2 suction cups..so i didnt bother returning it.

41850,2,"All the towbars they made of this type are completely worthless. My girlfriend's car stalled in the middle of the street, which is why I can't use a dolly to tow the car. I went to AutoZone and bought this piece of crap. HUGE disappointment!!! The manual says that you have to buy and/or make a piece of metal to attach to the towed car's chassis, how in the world am I going to make a piece of metal to attach the towbar to my truck in the middle of the street with a line of fifteen cars honking behind me??!!! On top of that, you also have to buy and make safety chains (which are required by law, or so they say in the manual), which means, this is an incomplete piece of crap that will only help the guys with cars that run!!! and who have the time (retired people maybe?) to spend making metals, drill holes, buy bolts and nuts, attach these metals to the bottom chassis of the towed vehicle and then buy chains, cut them, make safety locks for them and install them on the towbar. When I bought it, I thought it was going to work for me, but of course, I was disappointed. What a crappy design !!! Very disappointing."
24133,1,"The factory roof rack on my Camry wagon is rated only 100 pounds, so a solid carrier uses up that rating before adding any cargo. So this lighter carrier was interesting. It does 80 mph without a flap. I did have some issues though due to my assembling it imperfectly. Others have said that the instructions are clear but no matter how obvious, it was not clear to me that the rear top reinforcing spar had small pockets so that its ends could go INSIDE the red reinforcing patches. I put the ends of the spar against the red patches, and it kept vibrating loose, moving, and once poking through the wall of the carrier.I assembled the frame alone first, and tossed it up on the car to align the crossbars on my car's roof rack; glad I did that. On mine, the frame tubing did not mate far enough for the spring-pin to reach its hole on one side, so I had to file it a little to get it fully engaged. I assembled the whole thing before putting it up on the car; glad for that too. Putting the bottom sleeve over the frame was very difficult as it seemed the frame was simply too big to fit in, by a little bit. Had to really struggle to try to stretch the material enough so that the velcro could reach over the front of the frame.Putting it onto the car was aggravating, because the holes in the vinyl enclosure for accessing the brackets with their hand-tight knobs were not lined up with the holes in the aluminum frame. That made it very difficult to hold the carrier, the bracket, the knob, and put it together, while trying to force the edge of the vinyl cover out of the way. This is of key importance and should have been built better. I would rate the carrier very lowly because of this, except for that the carrier is roadworthy, once it's on, which pleased me a lot.There are two nylon fabric handles on either side for lifting the carrier onto the car, which have vinyl wrapped around them to make the handles more comfortable. That vinyl handle raps against the roof when the handle flaps in the breeze, so I cut off the vinyl handle leaving only the nylon mesh handle inside, and was glad I did.I drove 1500 miles with the thing packed, and ran through rain. Others reported it rainproof but I found some moisture or water came in through the velcro-flap-covered bracket mount locations, so, would advise against depending on the contents staying completely dry. Especially some water built up on the floor in the nose of the carrier as that area of the soft floor was depressed a little bit compared to the main area which was elevated a little more on the roof rack crossbars.I did not even try running with it folded down and covered by the slip-on cover, 'cause I read other reviews saying it flaps in the wind that way; I just ran it fully erected even when empty, until finally removing it and storing it that way a few days after moving when moving activity had died down.This did the job for me: added cargo space without adding a hundred pounds for the carrier alone, and allowed worry-free highway-speed driving while reasonably weathertight. So I give it high marks; I did not find other products like this available. Expect it to be difficult to assemble, though. Ralph"
84265,0,"My first impression when putting on this helmet is its quality. The way shield moves, the padding, the way parts work and feel all says quality to me. Except for some of the vent levers nothing about this helmet is cheesy to me like some of the other brands.The paint is excellent as well and not likely to chip (I dropped my helmet when it rolled off my ST1300's seat. Even though it fell on to cement and rolled a few times it did not have a scratch on it. I did the same thing years ago with another helmet and it had horrible scratches and marks on it)The airflow through the helmet is worth mentioning too. My head stays cool in the hot summer months and with all the vents you can easily adjust the airflow to your liking.So why did I only give it 3 stars? Well a few reasons: Even with all the airflow options, the helmet fogs up very easily when its cold outside (didn't have the problem in the summer). The helmet is also very loud inside compared to my old helmets. You will need to wear ear plugs with this helmet as the wind noise will damage your hearing (surprising with all the padding it has that its so loud inside).Also, the way the padding is put together inside, I have been unable to find a way to route my Autocom audio systems headset wires through it (an easy task in my previous helmets).The final negative, is not really a negative about the helmet itself, but if/when you need accessories or replacement parts, be ready to spend a fortune for them as well as outrageous shipping costs if you get them from Shoei. The face mask optional accessory (to prevent fogging) will be needed for sure, but know that it will make it hard to wear sunglasses with your helmet as I like to do. Replacement shields are very expensive, but are also very good quality.I'm not sure if I'd buy another one. I haven't found one I like better yet and with the money I spent on this one I'm try to make it work. I'd certainly shop around and try on a lot more helmets before going with the Shoei again though (I did try on many before buying this one, but when you actually ride with a helmet the experience is different than trying it on in a shop)."
115906,1,"Easy install, quality item. Took about 1/2 hour to install only requiring simple hand tools. Anyone with a little mechanical inclination should be able to install these and will find it restores some tightness to the front suspension"
155903,1,"Once you've got the belt removed this thing is a proverbial piece of baklava to install, break out your wrench and you're done and enjoy your new solid pulley."
106615,2,"When I ordered this item it said ""insta-cling"" and that I could use it over and over because it held to the glass by static cling. It's not insta-cling, just regular tint. The problem is that I used it on my curved back window. It has so many creases because it's not meant for curved glass, so I'll probably take it off. I had insta-cling before on this back glass and it bent to the curved glass no problem (but I had to get rid of it because it was too dark, 5%, and failed the safety inspection). I thought I had found the perfect match because 35% is legal where I live. Next time I will call to make sure before I order it."
48117,1,Its exactly what I needed. and what i expected it to be. I had it installed n it looks great.
167094,2,Item looks cheap as the edges aren't stitched and the unit does not fall into the dash depressions as expected. It just sits there and looks wrinkly.
84593,1,It fits the truck perfectly and arrived sooner than expected. Very happy with it and my fuel mileage has improved since we installed it. Took about an hour from the time we opened the box until we were were done...a helper is handy & makes things go faster. The install could have been done by one person.
119721,1,These visors go on easy and do their job really well. And add some security if you leave your window open a little.
169334,2,"I purchased these mats as winter replacment mats for my Cadillac. I wanted to keep the original mats with the Cadillac Crests from getting damaged during the winter months. Salt mud snow etc. The quality of these ""premium"" mats is good but nowhere near the factory mats cushion and feel as described on the site. Also the color matching left something to be desired. Mine were at least 4 shades darker than the factory ones that match the carpet exactly (as you would expect from the factory). The fit however is good almost a perfect match to the originals. Bottom line, I could have paid half the price for the same quality mats at any auto parts store."
151222,0,"We bought these for our two little ones, and at first they appeared to be perfect, but the top corners end up folding outward after you secure the two strings that hold the top of the seat protector to the headrest. There is nothing you can do about it, while the vinyl material is pretty thick, it is still flimsy enough to where the corners cannot stay flat against the seat at the upper corners/sides. Flapping outward on the left and right side, the protectors end up getting caught on our childrens' shoes and becomes a hassle. I may try to cut the top corners/sides off, and see if that works. Too bad."
72662,1,"I ordered a hitch with the install kit. Item arrived on-time, and at the time I ordered, this was the cheapest price on the internet. I had it delivered to my auto mechanic who installed this in the truck for me. The only complaint is that the bolt holding the head to the frame was missing. A quick call to Reese and it arrived the next day in the mail. Very happy with this product.The slider on the hitch is great when maneuvering the trailer into tight corners. You can easily slide the hitch back away from the cab, allowing for an almost 90 degree turn. With the flip of a bar, the hitch will slide back to the towing position, allowing the weight to sit over your axels when driving down the road."
146651,2,Edelbrock used to stand for quality. The old man must be turning over in his grave that such poor quality is being sold under his name. Looks like it was made by third graders in China using rocks.
180903,1,"The tire cover was a nice quality. The only problem was that the cover is to be slid over the tire with elastic that is run through the edge of the cover. We were concerned since there was no way to secure the cover, it could be easily stolen. We spent more money buying metal cord and a lock to try to make it secure. Otherwise, it looks great on the car."
51068,2,"Despite the small size when not inflated the tube can get fairly large. I inflated mine to about 3.5' in diameter. PSI does not really play a role here, since there is no tire around it. I tried finding what the recommended PSI rating is but wasn't able to... I don't think it applies.The tube popped on me half way through our adventure at Harpers Ferry on the Potomac. Not sure if the tube is really to blame, the water was fairly low and I did hit a few large rocks. These tubes also deform fairly easily, and are not very comfortable to ride. This was my first tubing trip on an auto inner tube and we all got fairly bad arm rashes from paddling.If I had a chance, I would definitely ""splurge"" and spend the extra $8 for one designed for water tubing exclusively, and maybe also purchase a cheap canoe paddle. Because of the deformity, rash and having to walk 4 miles back to the car, I rate this 2 stars for water tubing purposes."
156321,2,"The title is deceiving. I ordered this specifically for the advertised ""lumbar support"" in the item name and description. Unfortunately, this was a complete misrepresentation of the product, as it offers no more support than a standard automobile seat. Also, the cushions shift on the seat, so I need to readjust every time I get in the vehicle. What a waste of money."
56063,1,Bought these to use at work. I've use these in the past so knew what I was getting. Easy to put on and take off. Bought from Amazon because I wanted blue ones.
186898,2,"I like the tirefly brand in general. They have a good lifespan (just good), they don't break, and you can replace the batteries for CHEAP if you also buy those on Amazon.These, however, are not that bright, and I think the maker was a little confused about what color they wanted. It seems like there is a purple LED (not really black light) inside of an orange case. The result is a pretty dim, orangey/purpley light. Don't let the picture on the box fool you; they're not nearly bright enough to turn your wheel into a circle of light."
92643,2,"Bought it in 2008 after the ice storm, and opened the box a couple months ago during the hurricane... Worked great during the hurricane outage, but dies in the recent snowstorm outage. Customer support did not return calls, but if you call (636) 532-9888 you can ask to hold for the next rep. and the replacement part was $28 after shipping.I broke down and purchased a real generator from B&S; and am glad for the purchase, and got schooled by the repair staff about 'catalog generators'... The truth is, you should purchase a bigger, name brand generator such as B&S; or Toro since most local repair shops can get parts for them.Basically, I bought the cheapest 4-stroke generator I could find, and I got a cheap generator which I will use only as a loaner, never for myself."

92744,1,"The quality and construction on these appears really good. Made of good materials. Clips fit on neatly. The lengths are a few inches longer than stock, making them easy to fit. Overall very easy, positive experience installing them.Compared to the stock Ford Motorcraft wires, these are thinner, have less heavily fortified plug connectors, and lack the heat shields to protect the wires from the exhaust manifolds. The Bosch plugs are made of heat resistant silicone, so hopefully that makes up for it.Overall - for 1/2 the price of stock, these are fantastic."
154851,2,"SES light would still go on and off with this Bosch replacement in a 2003 MINI Cooper R50. I have also confirmed that it is due to the sensor, and not an exhaust leak or other issues that may lead to a pre-cat O2 sensor code being thrown. Although Bosch is usually a safe aftermarket choice, if you own a MINI Cooper, I recommend going with the exact MINI OE replacement, or the NTK replacement:NGK 25648 Oxygen Sensor - NGK/NTK PackagingThe original sensors are manufactured by NTK, so those should truly be an exact replacement. However, I have yet to install my NTK replacement, so I cannot confirm. Hoping to try it soon."

I originally said I'd just seal it with some silicone, but after careful consideration, and seing how thin they were, I returned both. I'm sure they would have served the purpose that they were made for, but I have a feeling that since they were thin, and had no reinforcements around the fastener holes, that they would fail at a considerably quick rate. I would suggest to Camco that they at least reinforce the fastener holes. Other than that, and one being already cracked, they, like I said above, would probably work fine for awhile."

WELL ITS BEEN OVER A MONTH AND I STILL HAVE NOT GOT WHAT I PAID FOR, OR WHAT THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD SEND. small cash refunds do not make up for lack of integrity. if you tell someone you will d something, you should do it. if you have negative reviews, I would refrain from removing them untill all parties involved are satisfied with the results."

43999,1,This is definately one of the best things to help improve your handling. It's inexpensive and easy to do. I have a 99 expedition. I had to replace the lower ball joints on both sides so it was easy to replace the sway bar links while the front end was apart. Do both sides. Just remember not to torque them down until both sides are installed. Great product!

However, even though the picture shows that you get the wiper in its mounting fixture (ready to be easily attached to the oscillating arm on your car), WHAT YOU REALLY GET are replacement rubber blades only (not mounted in their fixture). These can be mounted in the existing fixtures on your car, but it is much more effort to do so. Once I got them mounted, they work fine."

40480,2,"After reading the mixed reviews, I decided to give the Wagan EA2045 the benefit of the doubt and placed an order.BE WARE: This item is considered ""hazardous material"" and cannot be returned to Amazon, although it was shipped via UPS and arrived with no labels which indicate any ""warning"" of such.In short, this item did not work as described to jump start my nearly dead car battery (the car was left in accessory mode for 40 minutes). I would give this item zero stars if available, but I guess the one star rating would apply since it did charge my cell phone as also described... but I didn't purchase this to re-charge my cell phone. The most surprising aspect of this purchase/attempted return is that I was unable to send it back to Amazon because it's considered ""hazardous material"". This absolutely should've been clearly stated before check-out, giving me and any perspective customer a last chance to opt-out of the purchase.In the end, Amazon customer service was phenomenal, like always, and processed a full refund.

22095,1,"This is a fine filter, probably one of the best. Naturally it fits, that's how it was manufactured. I do have a little problem with oiling the thing though. It is hard to not put too much oil on the filter when cleaning and using the ""oil-in-the-bottle."" It takes forever to drip out to the point that you can install it and then not suck oil into your engine. I am going to get the spray-on cleaner kit and hope that works better next cleaning. It's a little pricy but hey, it is more than likely the last air filter you will ever need to purchase."

I finally figured out the nut on the strut shaft had loosened, a lot. After several calls to Monroe Customer Service I was told to re-torque the nut to 50 ft/lbs. CS said that the nut should not have loosened. The exact same thing happened to a Monroe Quick Strut that I installed on my wife's Camry. Really poor quality control. Shame on you Monroe. These things are not inexpensive either."

98074,2,It broke the first time I used it. There is a piece that connects with your ratchet which is tig welded on to this piece. I broke it right off. You can go to any local Autozone or Advanced Auto Parts and buy a piece that has no welds that can break for just 5 or 6 bucks. This was not worth it.
4860,1,"I used this to make a tail pipe for a V8 transplant into my 1998 Cherokee. It worked out really nice and is much better than the stock pipe in a few ways. First, the bends are mandrel bends with no kinks. That makes for much better flow. Second, it is 2.5"" of course and the only pre-bent tail pipes for my Jeep were 2.25. Third, I was able to route it much nicer than even the factory bent pipe. One last thing is that is was cheaper than having one bent at the local muffler shop. Also, doing it myself I was able to make it fit exactly how I wanted it to fit.If your looking to make your own tail pipes these are just what you need.B"

137948,2,"My condenser arrived in pretty poor condition. There were multiple spots of dings and bends on the fins that run between the pipes to increase surface area. As delicate as A/C condenser fins are, the packaging seemed adequate to prevent most damage (if hilariously too big - but that's for the packaging review). So while some of the dings may have been from shipping, some bends are simply too mangled to have happened during shipping. Now I realize bent fins won't affect functionality much (too many bends and airflow blocks WILL affect cooling), but it really calls into question the integrity of the pipes. Were they bent too? I suppose I won't know until I hook it up. Even if they aren't, it certainly reflects poorly on craftsmanship. I'm very disappointed. Hopefully it at least works."

185656,1,"I can't even tell you how valuable this is to me--it's kept many a project on track. Here are some of the things I've used it on. I have a big Rubbermaid cart that sometimes gets left in a position that lets it get filled with rain which stresses the tires and sometimes they go flat. I go to grab the cart for some project and would be out of luck if I didn't have this inflator handy. I don't even put it away anymore. It sits of the edge of step in my garage. I have a heavy duty wagon that attaches to my garden tractor. I have another garden cart that can carry 250 lbs and often does. I have a heavy duty hand truck with big wheels. Don't know why they don't make all these things with solid tires, but since they don't, I bless the day I bought this thing. It's completely reliable and always works. I've had it at least four years, use it regularly and finally decided I should recharge the battery even though it showed no sign of needing that. I plugged it in for a few hours just in case, but it has never failed me.Yesterday I went to do some spring leaf work and found a tire on my tractor dead flat. The tractor is heavy and I worried that this little unit wouldn't be able to inflate the tire unless it was jacked up, but I gave it a shot and it came up just fine. The pressure gauge works well so I know when to stop.It's so handy to have a smallish unit I can easily carry to the tire needing help. I've not needed to do anything other than inflate tires with the standard attachment, but that has saved me on so many occasions this thing is worth its weight in gold. It's fast, effective and always works."

There were no warnings about that in the instructions. I'm disappointed. The other one is on my Land Rover that I drive year round.

All in all if you have a 95-99 dodge ram and are happy with a single shock set up it is a great buy but don't be fooled IT IS NOT A DUEL SHOCK SET UP as described.

Since I've already blown one because mine wasn't stock and the positive and negative were reversed, I don't want to hook this up until I know what goes where. How hard would it be to mark the back of the gauge for easy hookup?"

I sprayed it onto a couple blankets, enough to make the fabric wet but not drippy, and then let it dry.The blankets did not seem to retain any of the waterproofing because the horses and blankets were soaked after the first rain they were exposed to after the treatment.I understand it's possible that it's not the right product for the job, so I don't want to say it's a bad product, but I do wonder if I had put more on, would it have worked? Would it have worked if I had done two or three applications, letting it dry in between?Unfortunately I don't have the time or $ to experiment that much with it, so for what it's worth... I won't be using it on horse blankets."

There are two studs available for each of the roof rack mounts and these clips only use one of the studs. I bought my Yakima rack used, and it came off of a jetta with Q103 clips. The Q103 clips actually used both studs for each mount but the bend in the clip was slightly off and I want to have the correct fitment. It would have been nice if the Q18 clips used both available studs, and remember the package includes 2 clips, you will need 2 packages (4 clips) to fit your car."

36932,0,"I ordered this stethoscope over the other brands on Amazon because of its higher reviews. I had also read that other scopes were painful in people's ears. The quality of this scope is as expected, but the earpieces are painful to wear for more than a few seconds. That made it difficult for me when I was hunting for a noise in the front end of my car and had to test multiple places. For quality, I like the scope. For comfort, I do not. Ultimately, I'd seek an alternate scope (for comfort reasons) if I were in the market for this product again."
79638,1,This is the rear wiper blade for my Chrysler Pacifica. A big improvement over the old worn out blade. Fits perfectly.
85723,2,These floor liners do not fit very well. You have to cut tabs off to make them kinda fit. The tabs are not a big deal to cut that really isn't the complaint. When your done cutting them down they still don't want to sit on the floor nicely. I have had them in my Superduty for about 3 weeks and I am not very impressed. I have purchased floor mats for other rigs that fit a lot better.
56419,0,This tow hook is very heavy duty and appears to be good quality chome . Would have prefered the hook in 304 stainless but no one seems to make it probably because of the cost.
44092,0,"The hammer itself is great- lightweight, sturdy construction, 5/5 stars. The mounting bracket is another story entirely. It has to be installed with screws, yet the instructions recommend against doing this yourself for fear of damaging electrical wiring. Then they suggest using velcro or double-sided tape, but none is included in the box. To make matters worse, the bracket is concave, so you can't install it against a flat surface. I'm debating whether to return this product- I know it's important to have in the car, but it's going to be impossible to install."
7608,2,The mirrors vibrate and shift orientation when driving so every so often you must stop and re-adjust the mirror (these are not powered mirrors). There is no tension adjustment to be made so you are stuck with wedging something into the mirror housing - not very practical for multiple drivers of different stature. I replaced both mirrors on my vehicle with these and the problem is identical for both the driver and passenger side mirrors. Very Dissapointed.
64093,1,"Had some reservations about buying over the internet without seeing it in person. What can you do with these odd RV/trailer sizes? The other reviews on Amazon swayed me, and I took the plunge. VERY happy I did! Product arrived within a week with free shipping and no tax. Box was small enough for me to carry by myself (about 35 lbs) from the main office to my campsite 100 yards away. Took it out of the box. Placed the roll in its place. Broke the seal on the mattress condom, and it expanded to its full glory in about 30 seconds! Although it says it takes 24 hours to fully expand, you'll never notice the difference after 5 minutes. Spent plastic was easy to slide off mattress after it expanded. Firm and comfortable, the best I've had in the months since I bought my RV. Don't wait another night with those lousy factory RV mattresses. Can't do better than this! Satisfied customer!"

I live in the desert so air filters get real dirty, real fast and I figure the $77.00 price was less than what I would be spending on lower quality air filters. I did extensive web searching, for a lower price, could not find it cheaper anywhere, $107.00 was about the average everywhere else."
12764,0,"Have never had a set of chaps before and have froze from time to time. So decided to get a set, but didn't want to spend a lot of cash, as I don't expect to wear them much. Read the reviews on these and seemed like for the most part everyone was pretty happy for the price. Sizes seemed to be tricky so I followed what everyone said. Although I haven't wore them riding yet, I did try them on and found that they were long enough (being 6'-4"" was concerned), but seems like they are a bit tight around the thigh and ankles. Proably needed to buy the next size up. The leather seemed pretty stiff so I put some mink oil on them to soften them up and help with waterproofing. Rolled them up in my saddle bags and they have been there since."
146565,1,This worked great in my 2004 civic for my bulldog rs1300e I pulled out of my other car. Easy install although I cant bypass the antitheft yet. Need to call bulldog still. Works easy if its what your looking for.
102382,1,"This replacement spark plug fulfills the requirements of numerous gasoline engines at a very reasonable price without having to buy a large quantity compared to local automotive parts dealers. It is an original Champion part, not a knock-off, and was delivered expeditiously."
178668,1,"Last year, I wanted to replace the old/original wiper blades for my 2010 Corolla LE. I figured Walmart would have it cheap and got a Michelin just because of the brand - BIG MISTAKE!!! I had to endure the squeaking noise for the entire year. Finally, the year's up, and I thought I'd do more research before buying another set. I saw the positive reviews here and decided to go along with it. The results were great! No noise after installation!P.S. I will update if it doesn't survive the winter, but so far I'd give it a perfect review!"
8939,0,"Ease of use is low. It arrived with the knob loose so I simply tightened it with a allen wrench. Serves it's purpose.I wonder what copper stand cables are??UPDATE: After a few years, it started making a rattling noise inside. I opened it up, and found 4 loose nuts, one fell off and was the rattler. The cheezy box protects it well, but is falling apart.After using it several times, I finally memorized the instructions. It always does a very good job of telling me the battery's condition. Hook it up, load to half the cca, 15 seconds to test, fairly simple. Just make sure the load knob is all the way off when attaching and detaching or it will spark like mad.I tried to change from 3 to 4 stars, but it won't let me."
125385,1,Easy installation. I disconnected the battery intead of pulling a certain fuse. I purchased as a replacement for a lost remote transmitter.
127603,1,"They use a battery separator that has adhesive on it, the adhesive residue on the batteries and contacts make the unit appear to be DOA.Open up the battery door, take out the batteries, clean the contacts and batteries, put back together and it works perfectly.It would be much better if they used a plastic isolator strip without adhesive.Unit works great, accurate and I was able to check tire pressure in twilight without a flashlight.It seals well, it is a consumer grade product but for under $10 delivered to my door a great product."

151936,0,"The throttle tube on my grips was warped at the very inner end of the grip that would meet up to the end of the handlebar. Being that it was warped, it would not let the throttle return to idle on it's own.

After making the tube round on the inside edge, they are working perfectly fine now."

120307,0,"I got these gear grips to carry long handled tools, such as axes, rakes, shovels, cant hooks, etc. They seem to work a bit better on larger diameter handles or oddly shaped handles than they do on small round handles.The bases are pretty flimsy, and after just twisting on the clamps the little release button was mushed over and doesn't hold the clamps so well. The grip ratchets have a pretty coarse adjustment, so either things end up too loose or too tight.The bases will mount on large tubes, like the side rails of a Kolpin rear drop rack. They need periodic tightening to keep them from loosening up though."
107022,1,I started using NGK spark plugs back in the 1960's when two cycle dirt bikes were the ticket. The plugs have a very wide heat range that do not foul easily...making them ideal for high reving engines. Today they have set the standard to which other spark plugs are compared too.
125611,0,"The tool worked well on the terminals it actually can work on, can't blame the tool. This is a 5 star tool when it has the extractor you need and a waste of time when it doesn't. I'll be buying the other lisle terminal tool as soon as possible."

70203,1,"I bought this pump at Costo about 6 years ago. I used it very rarely when I drove my truck to the beach to air down. I might have used it to inflate a total of 8 tires. It worked fairly fast, and I felt I got a good deal. I sold my full sized truck this summer, and bought a new Jeep Rubicon in August. I have been hitting the trails often, airing down the 32"" tires to about 8 PSI in the snow at least once a week for the last few months. I would use the pump to air the 32"" tires back up to 38 PSI for the ride home.After 8 weeks of regular use, the fuse holder melted the fuse (didn't blow), and then melted the plastic fuse holder. Being resourceful, and I removed the fuse &#61514; and was back in business for two weeks. Then the whole game was up. The motor fused, refusing to turn, dead shorted. I'm replacing this pump with a much more expensive Viair pump (six times the expense), but the Viair won't be any faster... just last longer and be hard mounted in my Jeep.This Q pump is a pretty good deal if you don't need a highly reliable pump. I used it often, and hard. It gets hot, and I would often cool the quick-disconnect fitting with snow (which may have accelerated the failure). But for $60? Pretty awesome deal if you ask me. Great way to dip your toe in the water and see if this is something you will use often. If it is, plan on stepping up to a real pump (Viair, ARB, CO2). If not, you are into it less than a tank of gas."
70881,1,"After replacing multiple tact switches on my MPC 1000 over the years, I decided to see if DeoxIT would save me the trouble of having to do more repairs. To my surprise - it worked! I opened up my MPC, sprayed each switch with this stuff, pressed the buttons several times, sprayed them again & then put the cover back on. I then turned on my MPC & everything was maddddd smooth. Before I used DeoxIT I had 5 buttons that BARELY worked. One of them didn't work at all & the other 4 only worked occasionally. This stuff fixed them all within minutes. Crazy.5/5"
170809,1,"1995 Accord LX 4DrAGX + Megan springs; no camber kitsEbay FR strut barsBosal Rear muffler assembly(Bosal 281-365 Rear Silencer)PROS:-Substantial increase in handling and feel for a very reasonable price.-Requires no drilling or modification of any kind to car. 100% bolt on fun. Comes with all the required parts.-No ground clearance problems of any kind experienced.CONS:-Bar will likely sit very close, if not on your muffler pipe and may rattle or bonk at times.-Seeing the sway from the back looks cool; but because of the bends/design of the bar, it does look 'wrinkly' depending what angle you look at it.MISC:-The bar I got is black in color with a small ""ST"" sticker in the middle and can be removed if you want. The D bushings are black, and the endnlink bushings are red.THOUGHTS:First off, a hand to the company. About 5 months after install, one of the endlink bushings ripped on me. Brent at the customer service department was very easy to communicate with, and I was able to get a replacement. That's pretty awesome that such a great product has equally great customer service to back it up if needed.I was surprised/relieved when I opened the box and found a black bar; if it was green, I was going to spray paint it black anyway.The bar does bump against my muffler pipe sometimes, but I can live with it/don't care because of the handling benefits. It only makes noise over speed bumps, or super rough roads; very occasionally. If you have a sagging muffler, maybe it won't rub?This bar mounts with stock points that all ex/lx/dx trims have. This was the selling point for me because I am not going through the trouble of finding/installing EX subframe, just for oem ex bar. Highly recommend, and very worthwhile for LX and DX owners; I cannot comment if it is worth it upgrading from EX oem sway.This is just on my daily driver, but the car is just more enjoyable to drive All the time. Even when going slowly or straight; the body feels more poised. After install, you can really feel that it is linking, and making your rear shocks work more.I installed the bar after my shocks/springs; but I am very curious how this bar feels as an upgrade with stock suspension.When I ordered this from Amazon in April 2012, it said ""Only 1 left in stock"". Even when I checked a few days after, it still was there, and even now, it still says that. I don't know if that is BS or what."

115885,2,I was a bit disappointed when it arrived because I thought it was a chrome frame and it was white plastic!
26379,1,Bought these because my OEM rotors were toast after over 100K on them. I have had these on for about 5K and so far so good. Coupled these with some Hawk Performance LTS pads on my '05 Nissan Titan.The e-coating is holding up well and even with some long down hill runs with a motorcycle in the back have had zero warping or fading. The grind on the surface is perfectly crossed to help with the initial bedding and the cast looks good. Overall I am very happy with them.

160403,1,"I bought this part for my father's truck. His window fell into the door one day while he was rolling back up his passenger window. He was planning to take the truck to the dealer. I called the dealer for him to get a price quote. I was told the job would be about $400. I asked if they had the part in stock to do it myself. They said they would have to order the part and it would be around $250. I found it interesting that the part was in stock only if they were going to do the repair, not to mention the price was outrageous.A quick google search brought me to this product which is from what I understand is the exact part the dealer uses. For about $70 shipped, it sounded like a good deal. The part arrived in around 4 days. I took my Dad's truck over to my friends house so I could use his garage and we had the part installed in just under an hour.If you intend to do the install yourself, there are just two things you should watch for. 1. You will need someone to help hold the glass in place when you install the regulator. 2. Just loosen the bolts that hold the window to the regulator enough to remove the glass, if you take them all the way off, you risk dropping them inside the door.Glad I found this than letting my Dad pay big bucks at the stealership."
56574,0,"Never got a chance to use these only becuase when I typed in the specs of my truck the website said they were compatible. But when I recieved them, turns out they weren't. Not sure who was at fault on that one. I'm sure they're a good product but never was able to find out."

If this company was smart, they would offer the mesh gril covers in all stainless steel.The plastic covers look as cheap as you can get."

37947,1,I used to use a similar packer when I worked as a mechanic for an airline. This one works just as well but will do larger sized bearings. I was able to use it on the big inner bearing on my Ford F350 4WD and it worked flawlessly. The product itself seems well made and even has beefed up bosses to make it usable in a vise. The weight of my upper body was more than sufficient though and I cant imagine needing a vise. I expect that this unit will last me decades. Great price at under 20 bucks too.
183886,1,"I got it with word for word instructions,and it worked perfectly. I was on my second remote, both from the dealership, and honestly I was getting ripped off. These guys saved me money and time, and provided a quality product."
84266,1,"I bought this tester because a client with several boat batteries needed their failure definitively documented for a warranty claim.The literature claims the tester will operate with as little as 1 VDC, and there is no need to charge the batteries before testing. When I arrived on the client's boat, the batteries were at 11.85-12.00 V, which should be plenty to test the batteries. Not so. The 3184 responded with ""Charge & Retest"".After charging to ""Float"" with the multistage charger, the batteries were at 12.33-12.46 V (low for fully charged batteries). The 3184 responded with ""Good Battery"" for each battery, based on the CCA being close to the factory rated value. The only problem is that the batteries are NOT good. They are rated for 198 Amp-hours each, but can only supply about 10% of that before the voltage drops to a useless level (11.7 V).After much deliberation with OTC tech support, it turns out that the 3184 tester is not capable of testing all lead-acid battery types. My client has AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat) batteries, and the 3184 gives erroneous results. There is no mention of this shortcoming in any of the (minimal) literature supplied with the tester, or in OTC's description of the tester on their web site. I actually found the problem in the online OTC catalog on a ""compare features"" page while waiting on hold, and the OTC tech support people were not even aware of it.Thankfully, Amazon will accept my return. I am upgrading to the OTC 3167 tester, which claims to be able to test ""All"" 6-12 V lead-acid batteries, including AGM. Still waiting for delivery."

116723,2,"After a lot of searching for a car seat shade for my toddler who hates having the sun in his eyes, this shade appeared to be the best pick. Turns out, the fit is way to small for our convertible car seat. The description on the packaging clearly says that it fits all infant/toddler car seats. My husband had to struggle for an hour to get it on. It does not sit right and bows up and blocks the drivers view through the rear window. We currently use it because we have no choice until I find an alternative. I only gave it two stars insead of one because it does actually work to block the sun. If you are thinking of purchasing this shade, be sure you have a small enough car seat to fit it."

The only thing I had problem with was straightening out the (+) battery cable, I couldn't find a ""pretty"" way to get that cable to get out of the way without ripping it out of the harness that it was in. My car sounds great at around 2.5k rpm. The acceleration lag has significantly reduced. MPG-wise, I am not sure since I am revving it up more often now due to decrease lag."

5990,1,"I love motor oil and I love experiment with it too. I have a 2009 Acura TL and I only have 5000 miles. I didn't know how long the factory fill oil was sitting in my car when I bought it so after 1000 miles I changed it out to Red Line 5w20 because it is simply the best oil(polyol ester oil) when it comes to its additive pack(ZDDP-Zincdithiophosphate and Molybdneum(friction modifier). Now after reaching 5000 miles I decided to change my oil and decided to try Royal Purple 5w20. After researching the web and reading quite a bit on an oil forum, I was a sceptic because it wasn't received well. I heard everything from it shears easily and doesn't hold its viscosity to the fact that many used oil analysis(UOA's)didn't show favorably on Royal Purple's side. Well after having this oil in my sump for over a month, I can honestly say from the bottom of my butt dyno that I love this oil. I don't know if it is in my mind or not but I feel that I have better low end power and torque and the car feels a lot smoother as well. Red Line is supposed to be a very good oil, if not the best and many people who use it brag or notice how smooth their cars run with Red Line. Don't get me wrong the Red Line ran smooth in my car too but Royal Purple has given me a good balance of not only performance but also a quiet and smooth engine. Best of both worlds is what Royal Purple has given me. I am now a believer! Give it a try and hope your results are just as well as mine.P.S. I also bought Royal Purple oil filter to go with the oil so I am running royally great products. Just go to Pepboys, if you have one and hold a royal purple oil filter, its the heaviest filter compared to the others that they sell there. I have seen the filter cut open and it has a 100% synthetic glass media that filters the finest of wear materials but doesn't restrict flow at the same time.

I just want to point out that this is a generic roof rack and although it will fit a 2006 Ford Escape, it is not made for a Ford Escape or any particular type of vehicle for that matter. In addition, the description and the documentation included state that it is an easy installation. I don't not consider drilling holes in the top of my vehicle easy. These do not fit on the Ford OEM pre-installed rails on the Escape. I will say the product seemed to be sturdy enough to warrant a 3 star which I consider average, but I would not recommend it unless you are comfortable drilling holes in the roof of your vehicle."

94167,0,The wheel covers were ordered properly for my size tires and fit nice and snug but one of the covers blows off the wheel when we have winds. So I'm not very happy with this product. Even though it was purchased from Amazon.
96130,1,I love this cover!!! It has for sure saved my bike with the weather here in Colorado!! The bike may still be in the garage but the cover still rocks!!
21614,1,This was a good product at a great price. It easily snapped on my truck. It looks good too. I recommend this one.
118027,0,"I have many battery tenders including a four bank similar to this two bank model and all are 5 star except this 2 bank model. This two bank model caused significant am radio interference (took many months to isolate source to this unit) on our home intercom system messing with my favorite talk radio show. I emailed the company requesting assistance but after waiting 6 months never heard back (at this point I couldn't use it and was basically a paper weight). Finally I got bugged looking at it and called the company. I eventually got a rather abrubt guy in Florida who told me these multibank models all cause radio interference like I should have known. Stupid me! I told him funny I had a 4 bank with years of service and no interference and pointed out to him the FCC no interference certication on the unit. He said send it back and &#34;they will take a look&#34;. I packed it up with my Amazon receipt (purchased one year and a week earlier, one week out of warranty) and a note requesting an email for confirmation they got the unit and a return shipping email with tracking info so I would know when to expect it. I never got either but several weeks later a unit showed up (can't tell if it was mine repaired or another one) UPS with no note inside. I plugged it in and it works with no interference now so it is now 5 stars. I gave it an overall 3 stars for the defective unit and poor customer communications."

136626,0,I've used the product several times - the fluid being extracted flows as expected when I am manually using the pump - once the pump stops the flow stops. I've read the directions and have placed the pump handle in several positions but the results are the same.
181376,1,"I got this because the area I live in wants to inspect my car for emissions and I wanted to make sure I didn't have problems before I took the car to the inspection station. There's nothing worse than finding out you have a problem than when the inspector tells you.I read the instructions (something that a lot of reviewers neglected to do). What I found out was that I had several errors, all minor, but decipherable from the instruction book. That's what you get for 30 bucks.If you have half a brain, this thing is very usable."

26374,2,The Amazon.com web site said the this cabin air filter would fit a 2009 Lexus Es350. The filter had to be cut to fit the frame and was not as thick as recomended by Lexus. It did work but probably will not last as long because of the reduced thickness
16079,1,very good heavy duty step and can be used also when the tailgate is open. The onlydrawback is the aggravation in trying to get the step to go from the verticalto the horizontal position. There is got to be an easier way to design for this feature. I would still buy this step again even with this bad feature.

163511,2,"I have a similar model I bought on e-bay shipped from Crime Stopper warehouse. They wont support it, they refer me to the retailer that sold it to me and or installed it.My biggest gripe is the 2 way pager works one way most of the time and sometimes out of the blue it will receive updates letting me know my doors are unlocked or locked. I bought for the very reason of having a paging remote in case of break-in, no garage and cant see my car from my apartment.When the pager is functioning right I will have a few days to a week before i get a low battery indicator. After changing th battery out the clock on the pager resets and it looses paging function again."

153374,1,"What a pleasure using this mechanics creeper rather than my old one with the metal frame and viewable wheels. My back would kill me after using my old creeper and several times it pinched my arm or side on one of the middle open wheels. This Bone creeper has hidden wheels and is low to the ground. It's very flexible, sturdy and maneuvers wonderfully in all directions. I will never use an open wheeled creeper again. The only thing that I would change would be to add a cushioned head rest at either end. I will modify this one to have a head rest, I highly recommend this item it was well worth what I paid for it and I won't ever get pinched again by a creeper wheel again.Thanks,Michael"
98476,0,"for the price, its ok, the brush that comes with it dismantled by the second caliper i was painting, and during the first caliper while painting, the bristles came loose and all over the paint job ruining it. Do not use the brush it comes with, it is terrible. So far the paint seems to be ok, well see. I ordered the red paint, the paint was bright and i did 2 coats and it covered it real nice. very bright and no bubbles at all, dries super fast, i recommend."
113847,0,"I really had to think hard how many stars to give this. The truth is, the bits are bottom of the barrel in quality, but so is the price! I needed to drill some aluminum components, and these bits did the job for very little money - so 5 stars for that. The ""case"" arrived in pieces and is clearly not sturdy enough for the bits, so one star there (but who cares about the case). The bits themselves were (apparently) supposed to be stamped with the size somewhere on the shank (ie 1/2"") but only some of the stamps were visible, all visible stamps were crooked, and some were partially off the edge of the shank - keep your calipers handy in case you need to remind yourself what size they are. I think if you consider these a set of disposable bits, you'll be pleased. If these are going in your toolbox for daily use, stay away."
115170,2,"I used the Amazon drop down menus to select 2005 Suzuki Forenza S.It came up compatible but the bolts do not fit and the box says for Chevy.My mechanic called the manufacturer Fel-Pro who says the correct part number is ES72906-1.Amazon, please correct this.

46062,0,"This tender seems to work fine, the indicators and LED's display properly but I have two complaints and they made me return the device.1) its noisy. It has at least one fan inside with no temperature shut off. As soon as you plug it in the fan kicks on and it is fairly noisy2) it only has alligator clips. I suppose I could have learned that from the description, but I was intending to use this with my motorcycle and it has no SAE attachment and no way to add one without getting an adaptor."
85760,0,"I spent over a month researching off-road lights, trying to figure out the best brand and what light to spend money on. I ended up with the slim lights with 130 w bulbs from Amazon, who had the cheapest price on the net. I bought these for my Tundra and picked them particularly for the stone gaurd covers. Fit and finish out of the box seemed great, although they are made in Korea, NOT ARIZONA, USA....errr.... I do have to give credit to the wiring and instructions. This was first rate and I was impressed. Plenty of wire and already set up for my truck perfectly!Fist off, the 4 bolts for tightening the lights are horrible. I feel like they will snap if I tighten them any more, and yet, its not tight enough to keep them from moving straight down everytime I hit a bump. Second, the bulbs were turned on for over 15 mins while I installed the switches and they worked fine. The second I drove out of the driveway, the left side burned out almost instantly. Couldn't even get 100 yards down the road! Third, my tundra lights on high, (when the lights were working) literally drowned these lights out! I couldn't tell they were even on! Guess I don't understand all the excellent reviews on these, unless your headlights really stink, then I guess they could help. I'll be calling KC first thing this morning to see how they react. If they make me jump through hoops to get a new bulb, I'll be very upset!"
13846,1,very nice just what i wanted for my truck.Maltese cross is an added bonus. I would recommend this item to a friend
29171,1,I installed these on my 2012 Ram for my Alaska trip. They held up well nut they stained from the Alaska mud and warped somewhat.
106984,0,"when i got this i never thought that storing it will be an issue, when going out with the family in my RAV4 its hard to just roll it and keep it in the back as the back seats are occupied already and i wish it had like some better idea then just rolling it for storage, even after rolling it hard it takes a big space and needs to be stored in the back of the back seats which means i would sometimes need to get out of the car to get it when parking."
133378,1,"The stock horns on the Toyota Prius are nothing to brag about ... anemic and puny sounding. The Fiamm horns are bolt in replacements, they fit the stock location and stock mounts. Took me perhaps 15 minutes to replace the horns ... and that included time to take pictures.Now my Prius sounds like a BIG car with REAL horns. Some idiot came flying out of a parking garage at the airport recently, cutting me and a couple other drivers off. I laid on the new horns and a shuttle bus two cars up stopped, apparently thinking HE had cut someone off. It's nice to be heard in a car that lots of people otherwise ignore."
92124,1,"I bought front and rear Anco blades. They did fit my 2007 Escape but I had to Google ""2007 Escape wiper blade replacement"" to figure it out. Once I got the information it was fairly easy. The quality seems fine so far. If you want a quick, easy replacement this may not be your best choice. If you want a cheap, good quality blade and don't mind sweating a little, go for it! I deducted a star because of the difficult installation."

186650,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
105183,0,"It Is bright, but it doesnt seem to hold the charge very long, guess it would be good if you had it plugged in and it was stationary. We have had it for 2 years and is not working at all now. It gets a little bulky if you intend to carry it around which we had bought that for."

5375,2,I thought this fan was great for about 30 seconds. This fan is so floppy and cheap and it can barely ocelate on its own. The cord is sooooooo thin and within 2 days the cord became unattached from the outlet connection so now it is just junk. Spend a little more to actually enjoy some air flow!
28903,1,"After receiving a verbal quote of $400 to repair the Jeep Grand Cherokee window. I found this Aftermarket window regulator and installed it myself in a little over 1/2 an hour. Thanks.

54137,1,I use this year round for my Vulcan Nomad 1500. I have had it for 2-3 years. Works great and I like the additional attachments (pigtail to leave on the bike and the alligator jumper clips) that came with it.I replaced my original battery after 8 years but not because anything was wrong- I just felt it was time.The light on the power cord indicates when it is charging vs. floating. I can't hear it so it must be quiet.
185527,1,"We use this inverter to power devices like laptops and CD players in the car. It works great every time and gets a lot of use on long rides.My only complaint was the two outlets right next to each other. One of our devices has a wide adapter plug that covers the other outlet when plugged in.A minor inconvenience.This is a nice, solid way to get electricity for low-draw items in the car. I didn't have to buy a DVD player. Just use this inverter with my laptop (15"" screen) and run DVDs as long as I want for the kids."
96032,0,"I bought this scan tool to read the codes on my 1995 Corvette, which is an odd year for GM where some of their vehicles were transitioning from OBD I to OBD II. I bought this scan tool because it said it was compatable with my car and sounded like I would not need to purchase any accessories to make it work.Once I recieved the scan tool and opened it up I realized that there was no cable that would work with my car! The mystereious fifth cable is even shown in the manual along with the other four that were included. After calling the manufacture's tech support I found that this cable was not missing, but rather that I would have to buy it seperately.In the end this was not as good of deal for me as the Actron kit (which seems to be the same company). At least once I did receive the extra cable it worked and even tells you what the code means, not just a number."
35707,0,to start it was plastic and you can tell by looking at it it has little like hairline scratches on it it snaps over old cap thought it would be metal and replace my old master cylinder cap
125888,0,"These wipers work well at all speeds but, as I have found with most of the wiper blades that feature a ""spoiler"" the seem to drag water back across the windshield at highway speeds (65-80mph). The installation is simple. Another drawback is that the passenger side wiper seems to leave a residue line where it stops. This line washes off easily but still its annoying. For the price i would just go back to my rain-x lattitude blades, or try the PIAA equivalent"
13436,1,"Lightweight to carry, but holds my trailer solid as a rock.

11100,2,I needed a new back pillow for when I sit for long periods of time. I used it on a four hour flight and my back was worse when I got off the plane. It doesn't move with your back and was very stiff. I doubt I will ever use it again. It took me a few days for my back to recover.
140449,2,well it fits and works fine but it has the worse smell ever.... i literally opened the box it came in and immediately had to set it outside on my porch...i left it there for 3 days and it still has a horrible smell...cant even put it in my car because it smells so bad.
11031,1,"This device does indeed look like a car alarm. Remember, folks don't steal stereos because they're bright. This device would stand up to some scrutiny, but it is doubtful it will have to. The idea is to encourage would-be thieves to move on to a car sans flashing alarm lights."

156285,0,"I purchased a pair of these in March 2005 for my 1994 Toyota Land Cruiser. One bulb had finally burned out after over 10 years in service. I loved the bright white color and illumniation of the new SilverStars. However, in December 2005 one of them burned out. I figured I just had a defective bulb and replaced with another SilverStar. A week later, the other one burned out. I checked the company web site and the FAQ says that the bulbs have ""a life span of up to one year"". So expect to replace frequently at $40/pair."
106874,2,"First time and only time I used it was to inflate a motorcycletire. The bike was idle for 2 years and had 10 pounds in thetire. When I turned it on, it danced and bounced aroundon the driveway because it is so light. Had to hold it againstthe tire with my foot so it wouldn't flip over from jumpingaround. It sounded like it was working hard when connected.I connected it for about 30 seconds, then testedpressure with a tire gauge. Only got a pound more.Reconnected for 1 minute, got up to 12 pounds.Hmmm...This is going to take a while....I figured I let it run for a few minutes while squeezing andwatching the tire carefully. After about 3 minutes I look downat my feet and see it belching smoke. I quickly unplugged itbefore flames. This thing is way too cheaply made."
88454,2,"It comes with these plastic caps that don't work good. It has seriously popped off about 10 times! I ripped off my shifter and now I regret it, I am now going to have to buy a new one all together because it popped off and got stuck completely where I cant get the base part out of the knob. Looks cool but needs better parts."
152851,0,it works well but it does not have as good of a seal as the oem filter
93221,0,"The reviews I read before purchasing the Rain-X Roof Top Cargo Carrier were definately accurate and on the money.I needed something fairly inexpensive, which would keep suitcases etc. dry and needed something quickly for a tripwith unplanned passengers. So, in spite of the many mentioned zipper closure problems I ordered the Rain-X. I knew the weather should be fairly warm, so cold should not be a problem, but I was not expecting one of the zippers to be ""broken"". The paint was off one of the zippers and it looked like pliers had been used on it, as it was bent also. I was expecting for them not to zip easily, which actually silicone spray helped a great deal; but for one zipper to be totally unusable which was purposefully ignored after obviously trying to be fixed, that was uncalled for. It was poor quality control or laziness on the part of an employee to PURPOSELY mail out a defective product. If both zippers were working I would have been satisfied with this product as I purchased it with the KNOWN PROBLEMS."
159017,1,Ordered these as a gift for the Hubby and he really likes them. Sturdy material and brilliant colors in the logo. They fit perfectly on top of the carpet floor mats and don't slide around much at all. He just sprays them off and wipes them down and they look new again. Perfect for any fan.
176752,1,"I bought these for a buddy of mine as a gift. He said he gets all kinds of compliments on them when out riding.He also told me that everytime he takes his bike in to the shop for servicing he has to remember to take the valve caps off, because the service guys always try to keep them. Sneaky.Makes a good gift item for the biking enthusiast!"

160807,0,This product does not (mine at least) work out of the box. I had to use pipe tape (teflon tape) around both screw caps. Then it would work just fine. I also used plumbers putty around the caps to insure a tight fit. works great now but it's over priced.
163159,2,"Looked like a good product, but 10 months later it's junk. Has a lifetime warrantee, but Amazon doe not warrantee it, so I guess I have to try to get Dorman to make good on it."

101694,0,"They look good when you finally get them installed, but they could be manufactured better.1 - Paint. Others have said it and I will repeat it. The painting stinks. It is a cheap paint and easily chips & flakes. I had to touch up every frame I installed. I am doubtful how well it will hold up over the long run.2 - Fit. I live in Texas and I doubt that our plates are any different than the rest of the country, but the plates do not quite fit into the clear cover. It is close; really, really close. But not quite.3 - Mounting - This really bugs me. All plates and these frames have four holes for mounting, but the each car is different when it comes to mounting them. Most have just 2 mounts, some have four. Some use machined screws, some use self tapping screws. Needless to say, you will run into mounting issues. Have your coffee can of amassed, random screws handy; you're gonna need it!Get past the paint, fit and mounting and they eventually look great on the car. It just takes too long to get to that point."
127112,0,"We chose these for durability and because they are washable. They seem durable, but we've only had them a few months and have yet to wash them. The fit is not bad, but they do not completely cover the seat fabric in a few spots near the edges. Installation was about average for custom covers.The biggest negative would be the color. We ordered tan, but the color is actually gold and definitely does not match the factory interior. Perhaps it will fade to tan? They are a little bit cheesy as they definitely look like a cover and not the original upholstery. The feel of the fabric is similar to a backpack and hopefully will prove durable, but is not exactly nice to touch.I would probably try something else next time. We have had GT covers (Endura waterproof fabric) which are definitely an upgrade from these at about the same price. Most people who saw the GT covers thought they were factory upholstery and they have a nice foam backing. They lasted about 5 years before disintegrating at the seams, the color also faded out with tine. ""Clazzio"" leather seats look nice too for a little more money. They are made in Japan and get good reviews. We will probably try them next. Good luck!"

The #6 plug wire is also a little too long, making it difficult to get the excess out of the way so that the cover will fit back where it's supposed to.So although Amazon lists them as a replacement part for my car, they aren't exact. On the other hand, the price is pretty good!"
89177,0,the bulbs are 100watt not 110 watt. the purpose of purchasing these bulbs was to be able to see more at night. it does the job of lighting the way but i would have thought the bulbs would be little more yellow then it is. dont expect a HID yellow but more like a slight tint of yellow. but overall the bulb does a good job lighting the way.

After installed, opened the door and it would not stay open. Then tried to remove the strap, pull to the outside and open the door all the way, the strap had opened so far on first use it would not come out, used needle nose pliers to crimp it far enough to get it out. Took out a second time, cleaned, reshaped and used some JB weld to see if I could stiffen it. worked once, all i have tried so far. Will see if it works again. Looked at the second one, I see a way to weld an extra strap of metal to add tension to the design but should I have to??? Too thin and basically junk. How hard can it be to copy a functional part??"
58362,0,"I have ordered the park smart before. I loved it. I bought another. Now, however on my third order, they are not made from a ""rubber"" like material but made from a hard plastic. This products slips more when you roll on it. It now has stickers to hold the mat in place. Probably a good feature until you may want to move it."
48698,2,"I agree with most of the positive reviews of this product: relatively quiet, easy to use and I like the auto-off feature. The one big drawback is that the clamp at the end of the air hose is made from 100% plastic. I tried multiple times to inflate two tires on two different cars with different tire brands and I could not get the clamp to release from the tire stem without pulling with all my might. I lost probably 3-4 pounds PSI each time I tried to release the clamp and worried I would damage the tire stem each time. I'll go to the gas station before I use this pump. I'm sending it back."

179553,1,"I bought one of these kits from Amazon.com. One of the panels was broken in the first shipment. Amazon had UPS pick everything up and sent me another kit. Everything was in good order in the second shipment.I went to my local Wal-Mart and bought two EverStart Marine 27DC-6 deep cycle batteries (115 amp hours each - $143.62 total with tax) to use with this kit. I also purchased four heavy duty battery terminals for #2/0 wire ($12.82). I went to Home Depot and bought two 2ft strips of #2/0 wire ($14.17). I connected the batteries in parallel with the #2/0 wire.In theory, this gives me 230 amp hours of storage. I mounted the panels onto the PVC pipe and put it on the roof of my house. The panels are facing East at an estimated 30 degree angle. I chose this location because you can't see the panels from the road (minimizing chance of theft).However, the general guidelines are: solar panels should face South in the Northern Hemisphere and North in the Southern Hemisphere; A solar panel's angle should be set to the equivalent of your your latitude plus 15 degrees during winter, or minus 15 degrees in summer.After installing the kit and hooking it up to my batteries, I left it alone for about one week. This gave it time to fully charge the batteries. Today (9-24-2008 -- sunny) I tested the output with a digital multimeter at 12:08pm CST. I am located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The charge controller output voltage was 14.19 volts; and the amps measured 2.61.In order to measure the amps, move the red wire on the multimeter to the 10A DC plug. Turn the multimeter knob to 10A. The multimeter needs to be in between the battery and the charge controller. Imagine a Mom holding a child's hand and a Dad holding the other child's hand. The child is the multimeter. The Dad is the positive battery termial. The Mom is the red wire coming out of the charge controller and going to the battery.Watts = Volts x Amps. So, the charge controller was outputting about 37 Watts. In order to maximize my batteries' life, I do not want the percentage of charge to ever drop below 80%. This is equivalent to a 12.46 volt meter reading with my digital multimeter. I got this kit to tinker with. This is my first solar kit. Right now I have the included 200-watt inverter hooked up to the batteries. It is providing AC power to my fish tank water filter. I am going to add more devices to the inverter each week until I start getting close to the 80% battery charge. I recommend buying a device called Kill-A-Watt by p3international (about $20). It will show you all of an AC device's power comsumption information."
6815,0,"I bought two sets of these chains before a snowboarding trip just in case we needed them at some point. Before we left, I opened one of the sets of chains to practice installing them on the vehicle and to check them for proper fit and operation. Installation would have gone incredibly smoothly were it not for the clips that link the cable on the outboard side of the tire. On the set of chains I opened, the crimps that linked the cable clips to the cable did not provide enough clearance to properly connect the cable ends to each other. I was able to remedy the issue in the garage but I never would have been able to use the chains in the snow if I hadn't checked first. I am seriously considering returning the second, unopened, set of chains I purchased because I don't want to mess with them.If the cable clips had fit together properly out of the package, I would have given this product 5 stars. I would recommend this product but I would also recommend test fitting your chains before you need to use them."

I get my gas from a gas station where Top Tier 100% pure gasoline is sold.Maybe I did not need an extra fuel treatment but for peace of mind I used it.From among Redline products I also use D4 ATF.I have yet to do more MPG per tank calculations but the first calculation showed me that Redline fuel treatment has not added any MPG. With the treatment I got the exact same mileage I used to get without it. All other conditions being equal.I bought another bottle to try on our van. I hope to be able to get better mileage with it there.Even if I do not get higher MPG, I would not regret using it as a great cleaner. We do not even know now if Chevron Techron fuel treatment includes that specific detergent or not. No mention of it in the product data sheet.Does anyone know what 'pollution control valve' is in a car? Because here and on redline website it says 'Cleans pollution control valves'. As far as I know there is no such thing in any vehicle. If they mean PCV-positive crankcase valve, even then this is problematic since no cleaning can revive a dead PCV. It needs to be replaced and in many applications the price of replacing it is a few dollars at most. Anyone knows what redline and amazon mean by 'cleaning pollution control valves' ?"

160475,1,"I need something to inflate my bicycle tires, and I don't want to buy a bicycle floor pump because it takes up space and is expensive. Since I already own an air compressor with a tank, I bought a cheap but fancy air chuck with a pressure gauge that is the same brand as my compressor. It had generally good reviews, but when it arrived, there is a problem. It has a male thread, while my air hose also has a male thread. I had to shop for an adapter before I can use it. That is another $10 for a quick connect kit. About a week later, the connect kit arrived and I hooked up the air chuck. To my dismay, it did not inflate my tires with the Presta valve to Shrader valve adapter! I was flabbergasted! I have to return it and get another one. It looks like a design fault or manufacturing defect. A similar one from Amflo, which gets rave reviews, would work but it costs close to $30 with shipping included. The other alternative is to buy a 12 volt inflator (generally slow and noisy), or one of those jump start batteries with an inflator built in, or one of the 120 volt air compressors. I was resigned to buy a jump start battery/inflator for $40 when I accidentally stumbled upon this Slime air chuck for less than $3. I thought I would give it a shot. It is a simple device with a female thread that I can just screw onto the air hose directly. If I had bought this in the first place, I would not have needed the $10 quick connect kit. Simple though it may be, it works, and it looks like it is indestructible. Even if I get something more fancy in the future, I will keep it as a backup. Wish I had seen it and bought it first!"

64376,2,"I was pulling my dad's car out of the driveway on our very narrow city street. As I turned the car left, I made a glancing blow of my front left panel on the fender of another car (which, luckily, happened to be mine!) A longish, not very deep dent, about 12 inches long and 3-5 inches wide, was the result. After getting several body shop estimates-- ranging from a high of $900 to a low of $250-- I decided to give this product a try. I figured, at worst, I would be out $15-$30, right? If the thing didn't work, I could still pay the darned auto body vultures, right? I mean, at worst, I would lose a few hours of hassle and an extra $30, right? And maybe I would save several hundred bucks, right?Wrong.The thing mostly didn't work, and the amount of frustration this piece of junk caused was far more damaging than the original dent.OK, so I get the box in the mail. Contained inside is a glue gun, two solid black colored glue sticks, a metal U-shaped bracket about 5 inches long with two suction cups at each end of the ""U"", two pieces which looked like flat plastic suction cups with a metal screw attached, another screw cap like thingy, a plastic scraper, a stick of solid plastic about 7 inches long and 1 1/2 in diameter which looked like a giant white crayon, and a small bottle of greenish liquid. Oh yeah, and an instruction sheet which looked like it had been photocopied on a 1963 mimeograph machine. All of this was tossed haphazardly into the box.OK, so the basic idea seemed pretty simple. You heat up glue in the glue gun, slather liquid glue onto one of the flat suction cups, attach the suction cup to your car in the center of the dent, so the screw is sticking out perpendicular to the car. Let glue dry. Then you get the U-bracket and put it over the suction cup screw, with the U upside down relative to the car and on the ""flat"" part of the car (over the dent, but not IN the dent.) Then you attach the screw cap to the suction cup and start screwing. The physics of thing starts pulling on the suction cup, and this is supposed to pull up the dent with it.Sounds simple, right?OK, so first time I do this, the front edge of the dent actually does pull back into place! Wow! I'm impressed. That only leaves about 11 inches to go. However, when the suction cup pulls off, the glue stays stuck to your car! (and occasionally on the suction cup.) You are supposed to remove the glue with the plastic scraper and the plastic pencil thingy. When that doesn't work, you are supposed to use the green liquid.This turns out to be almost an impossibility.I start scraping the solid black glue with the plastic scraper. The glue starts to come off sort of, but mostly it just starts to mash the glue further on down the car, so there is now a long streak of black goo down the side of the car in addition to the dent. So now the car is not only dented, but looking like crap. OK, I figure, I'll go chemical. So I open the green liquid-- which is only about 2 1/2 ounces, not much. Must be really powerful, I figure. It does STINK to high heaven, so it's GOT to be powerful, right? I pour the stuff directly on the car and start rubbing. This does seemingly NOTHING AT ALL to the glue! I am now starting to panic. I pour more onto the car and starting rubbing like a madman. Whether it is the liquid or the friction of my rubbing, the glue starts to slowly come off. It takes about 15 minuted of rubbing to get about 80% of the glue off. My wrists are sore like heck.Since the thing did work, sort of, I decide to try again. So I pick up the glue gun. Unfortunately, now I can't get a single drop of glue out of the glue gun! Is it on? Yes. Is the glue stick in there? Yes. Why won't glue come out? Who knows!!! I start manually pushing the glue stick into the gun, and even this is not working. After pushing really hard one time, I get about four drops of glue out. I switch glue sticks. This seems to fix the problem for the moment. I get glue. I set the whole apparatus up again, only this time, when the suction cup starts pulling on the dent, it just pops right off. No effect to the dent at all!!Or a second time.Or a third time.Or a fourth time.Or a fifth time.(And remember, after each of these times, there is glue to remove-- scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing, glue to coax out of the piece of crud glue gun, a mess and a disaster.)Then I realize that part of the problem is that the bracket is only 5 inches long. This means, if your dent is wider than about 3 inches, forget it. The bracket won't span the dent. That is, it won't work. So, if you have dent one inch wide, this might work wonders. But then again, if your dent is only one inch wide, one wonders why you would bother.After 4 1/2 hours of frustration--- oh, so much pain!!!--- I decided that $250 didn't sound so bad for the pros to do it.I give the product two stars, because it did shrink my dent about 11%--- but also because I am such a tremendously generous guy, and because I am practically delirious from frustration and panic.Hey, it might work for you, who knows?But, I doubt it.Just goes to show what good marketing and infomercials can do for you even if your product is a piece of junk."

Also, the company does not respond to email about this or any other problems so if you wish to throw $160 out the window, by all means do so, but recognize you will get a quirky gadget that is almost never accurate (requires constant adjustment), whose display and internals are not well suited for the automobile environment and where there is no customer support if something goes wrong."

This dent puller arrived within two weeks (I think amazon should really get it in stock so you can use Prime shipping!), but it came with a huge, thick product catalog from the original company. What a waste of shipping and handling money =(Anyway, it definitely has a STRONG grip, as long as your dent is the right size. This won't take out little dents. But if they're about the size of a LARGE grapefruit or bigger, it'll work okay. It's not gonna get rid of ever dent and dimple, but it will do what my brother calls a ""40-foot job"" (looks good enough from 40-feet away)."

The 4x4 needs only the rotor, the 4x2 needs the rotor assembly and new spindle nut (36mm, 295 lb ft torque). The item description does a poor job of explaining these very major details.

Unlike a traditional car cover, it will take seconds to put the TOUCHLESS CAR COVER on your vehicle or take it off. No longer will dust and dirt get on your well taken care off automobile because of a dirty traditional car cover.Best of all, this remarkable car cover will cost about the same or less than the traditional car cover.Bottom line - this is not your father's car cover.We invite you to join our interest list.Those on our interest list will be given priority status when the Touchless Car Cover is ready for shipping. Also, once our prototype is complete, you will get an email with the full details including dimensional drawings.THE FOREVER DIRTY CARIf you use an outdated cover, once your car is washed you face the unpleasant choice of leaving the car uncovered to immediately start collecting dust (yes even inside a closed garage) or covering the car and trapping moisture that stays present in the hundreds nooks and crannies of the car. If you cover your car just after washing you subject yourself, if using the old fashioned cover, to growing mold and bacteria under the cover and within the unreachable nooks and crannies. We've all entered a car that has the faint (or strong) odor of mildew. This can be prevented by immediately covering the just washed car with the TOUCHLESS CAR COVER. No dust. No trapped moisture. No chance for mold to grow. The car is allowed to dry naturally and dries without the accumulation of dust.It takes the average car 18 to 30 hours to fully dry, depending on ambient temperature. In colder climes winter temperatures can more than double this drying time. In that time your car accumulates enough dust so that the outdated cover will scratch the finish when placed on the car no matter how soft the fabric of the cover is. You can see the results of this on otherwise well taken care of automobiles that have fine spider web scratching on the car. Unless you wash the old style cover several times a month, this scratching can become severe. If a small piece of grit gets trapped within the old style cover from placing it in the car trunk, on the garage floor or cabinet, the scratching can easily make its way through the clear coat or worse.This same moisture trapping event is a problem for those that live in foggy areas. Ambient marine layer or fog while using the old style car cover will be trapped just as post washing moisture.The TOUCHLESS CAR COVER costs no more than an old fashioned car cover but does much much more in protecting your car.Your car will be worth more at trade in time or at auction time in case of collection car and you will save the price of the TOUCHLESS CAR COVER by decreasing the use of car washes."

174081,2,"I bought this cable to go along with the viair 85P portable air compressor, that way I didn't blow fuses.As soon as I opened the cable, I noticed it was only a couple feet long, which is not very long, but I was happy anyway.. The clamps also don't open up far enough to connect to a battery terminal securely.I took it outside and plugged it up to my compressor, popped the hood of my car and as soon as I opened the clamp the positive wire fell out of the clamp.Once I inspected the wire and the clamp, you could clearly see there was almost NO solder on the wire, and what little bit was on it was a ""cold joint"". The cable was also not crimped to the clamp like it was suppose to be (it looks like someone forgot to crimp it) , which is another reason it came apart.I went ahead and pulled the sleeve off the negative clamp and noticed it WAS crimped (unlike the positive clamp), but the solder was also very little and cold-jointed.Both clamps were also forming rust around the solder connections where the wire goes.LUCKY FOR ME, I own a soldering station, so I disassembled both clamps, cleaned up the rust, re-soldered them on PROPERLY and THEN crimped them. They work perfect now and should never come loose again.This is the first time I've ever rated a product 1 star, but when it literally falls apart as soon as you remove it from the box , it deserves 1 star.I'm just glad I wasn't stuck somewhere on the road with a flat when it fell apart on me. Luckily I ALWAYS test my equipment before I rely on it for emergency use.I wouldn't recommend this product unless you own a soldering iron and want to take the gamble of fixing it yourself or returning it to amazon.EDIT: I bought another set of these cables, and they were properly crimped and soldered, I will upgrade my rating from 1 star to 2 stars, but RoadPro needs to improve their Quality Control."

A quick check to see if there was a way it would go in with the back window pushed out in the open position confirmed that suspicion. Note this review has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself - that seems okay though I haven't / can't use it enough to really be able to say accurately (just my observation from looking at it). If you have a truck that doesn't have roll down windows in the back (i.e. a crew cab rather than extended cab), you are likely to find this isn't going to work."

They fit OK but are now three pieces, not one. Also, when you open the box, the rubber smell will knock you over. After scrubbing these relentlessly, they still smell like rubber.

63197,1,"I have used this on planes and it worked with my laptop. Really like its small size. Today just plugged it into a solar panel that puts out 12V (but has large voltage range) and it started to smoke. So I took it back to my car and after it blew out more smoke continued to work. Reading the spec, the input voltage is 12.8 - 13.2 volts - which is pretty tight. I shouldn't have plugged it into the solar array because the voltage with no load is probably like 14-15V, but come on. Its not that hard to design a circuit to handle a higher voltage input. Car systems are known to have lots of strange noise and voltage jumps. So I give it 4 stars because while it smoked, it continued to work. I suspect a couple parts are a bit crisp on the inside.

I installed this to a 1997 Honda Civic.The main thing I really like about this product is that all of the bolts and sizes are metric and are the exact same as their OEM counterparts which can't be said about most of the cheaper replacement parts you get at the auto parts store. Nothing worse than having to dig out an obscure SAE wrench somewhere out of your toolbox to adjust an aftermarket part on a Honda."
125704,2,"[ 4-piece set for 2005 Ford Freestyle]I've bought many sets of AVS visors over the years. Their quality has definitely gone down hill! The tint color is unattractive. The edges were not finished well. The surface had scuff-marks. And it took three sets to get one that didn't have a cracked visor, right out of the box!Fortunately, Lund International's customer Service is Superb! I guess they NEED to be.I ordered a set of EGR visors for my Nissan Titan at the same time. They were beautiful. At least twice the thickness as the AVS (where needed), no scuff-marks, smooth edges, installed in a couple minutes. Cost about $6 more! Nuff said!"
10501,1,"I had been looking for a small ""shop-vac"" type portable vacuum for months. I have my huge shop-vac in the garage, but it was such a pain to carry to the basement to use. My wife didn't want me using our regular upright vacuum to pick up saw-dust and dirt, and i didn't think the Dustbuster type vacs had enough storage or suction. So i decided i needed a small (1-2 gallon) shop-vac that i could carry in the house quickly if need be. All the ones all saw previously were corded and I thought that would be a pain, then i just happened to come across this at my local Big Lots store for $20. I bought it immediately. The vac comes with alot of attachments and a shoulder strap (even though it's not very heavy). The suction is pretty good for what I need it to do. The battery is descent. Not sure how long it would last in continuous use, but i just turn it on and off for 30 seconds of use or so and I'm guessing it lasts about 25-30 minutes between charges. My only gripe is the hose is much too rigid and it doesn't have fittings on each end that allow it to rotate as you use it. Also, it has 2 suction settings. I don't see where the reduced power mode has any use and leave mine on high suction all the time. I haven't used it as a blower yet, but i'm guessing (based on the suction power) that you're not going to be able to blow leaves very far. Seems like it would work well to inflate childrens tools such as beachballs and baby pools well though. All in all, this is exactly what i was looking for at exactly the price i wanted to pay. Make the hose more flexible and maybe add a bit more suction and everyone in America will buy one. UPDATE!!! Battery died completely after about 2 yrs and is not replaceable. Switched to a Ryobi vac with the 18V battery pack so when a battery dies, you just use a different one."
75235,1,"I rode over 9000 miles in 15 months on the stock seat and my butt hurt most of those miles! I was reluctant to spend $400 on a new seat but finally caved after a long ride with my wife. After just a few days with the new seat I am kicking myself for not having done this sooner. This seat is AMAZING! You sit a little lower and your passenger a little higher and that provides a backrest to the driver. The additional support for both passenger and driver makes for a very comfortable ride. I give this my highest recommendation. If you do any kind of riding at all on the Vulcan 900 classic or Classic LT, so yourself a favor and get this seat! Make this your first upgrade on the bike!"

10327,1,"Getting to the bed of my Silverado Truck was difficult when hauling my 5th wheel. I had to carry a small stool in order to access the bed. I purchased the Bully AS-550 side steps and the problem was solved. They were a snap to install and they are rock solid when I step on them. When not in use, they rotate to the side out of the way. The step is built out of cast aluminum and the supports are thick welded steel, all giving the step a solid mount. The only negative, and it is slight, is that the step could be a bit wider and they do rattle a little when I hit a bump.Otherwise I give them an A. A definate need on a pickup. Ken"

128386,1,"First of all, Yakima makes great products, en par (if not better) than Thule. That's why I bought their towers, clips and the corresponding cross bars for my 2005 Ford Focus ZX4 ST, in conjunction with their FatCat 6 ski/snowboard mount.The only two issues I had were as follows:1) Both crossbars, when installed according to the exact specifications, display a slight downward warping/sloping between each two towers. I reached out to Yakima's excellent customer service, and after they checked with their fit team, I was assured that this is quite normal for some car models, depending on a variety of installation variables. This put me at ease, and, functionally, there is nothing wrong with them and the sloping doesn't bother me anymore.2) The recommended distance between the front towers and the rear towers is only 20 inches for my car model. This is quite a short distance, and it makes putting long skis on the ski mount difficult. No problem for snowboards, but skis have been an issue for me. Yakima customer service insisted that I should not deviate from the recommended 20 inch distance, and recommended that I should be using their stretch kit if I require a wider space between the front and rear. This kit costs upwards of 100 dollars and looks a little bit like a kludge to me.My recommendation is to download the installation and fitting instructions for your car model first to see what the distance between the front and rear towers (and, consequently, the crossbars) will be, to see if it fits your needs. I would say that 20 inches is the absolute minimum, and doesn't work for all purposes.Hope this helps someone. Rest assured that whatever issue you might be having with Yakima products, their superb customer service will be getting it right for you. At least that was my experience."

81250,1,"I used this product on my Flexsteel leather couch, a very high-quality couch. It's a super long couch because it is actually two loveseats assembled together. Each loveseat has an arm, one left and the other right. Putting them together makes it one giant piece. It's a lot of leather and that's why I bought this large container.I found that I had to buff a LOT more than I expected. It took days for the conditioner to completely sink in after application, but I applied a heck of a lot thinking I was saving time. You should be aware that buffing will probably be required and it will take some time for the leather to absorb the conditioner.The result is remarkable. The color of the leather seems more vibrant and it has a shine. Ultimately, this is protective of the leather and will make it last a lot longer. In the meantime, it makes the leather look richer.One thing you will have a lot of trouble figuring out based on looking at product information for a large piece of leather furniture is what type of product should be used on it. If you have an expensive piece, most likely there won't be instructions for this. That's because the manufacturer doesn't want to take chances by informing you which conditioner you may use. The retail representatives that I questioned didn't know anything about treating leather.Lexol works just fine on an expensive leather couch as my experience showed."

Maguiar users, don't throw out your Gold Class just yet. Ice applies easily and leaves a nice shine. Not better shine that other products. You don't have to avoid rubber or plastic parts which is nice. It leaves a particularly nice shine on plastic parts but not better than the Maguiars Vynl polish at less than half the price. The residue that ice leaves behind means you will be rubbing endlessly! This is likely due to chemical reaction of products used previously. A clay bar may remove other product before applying Ice. Do not use Ice liquid clay bar unless you want to spend hours getting that pasty mess off your vehicle. I like Maguiars Gold Class for painted surfaces.

159806,1,"Years ago a solid state battery charger would be ignored by most as unreliable and/or cheap. Times changed and now many solid state items represent those of the best quality. I've found this product line to be one of those lacking nothing - and of the best quality. The five year warranty that comes with it helps re-enforce that idea.Yes, this product is made in China - to the American (USA) VDC company technological standards. I wish everything could be made here in the US as I am USA born. That's no longer the case with many of the product names I grew up with - at least VDC is still an American company based in Huntington, New York. But still, I'm glad I purchased my BatteryMinder 12248 over a year back in 2011.There-in was also something I found especially refreshing. When I opened the packaging, I wasn't greeted with instructions in some other language but in my own native English - taught to every US citizen and recognized as the true one language of our country by most Americans. Seeing instructions in every language always tells me some portion of what I spent on a product went into all those other translations - especially irksome when, to start with, the language is SUPPOSED to be English for products sold in the US. The small instruction manual is clear - there's just 35 pages VDC would like you to look over first to improve your knowledge of this product. That's nothing excessive or unreasonable. I actually like to know the proper use of products - just like I enjoy knowing the proper way to operate a vehicle I'm driving down the road. I find it safer that way, and my cars all last longer for my knowing how to drive and maintain them - and I'm also sure other passengers, drivers, and pedestrians appreciate my responsibility.I could have easily used the 12248 without the manual by just using a little common sense and knowing how batteries are sized and what type they are, but the manual does contain everything you need to know concerning the operation of the 12248. There are also printed instructions on the unit. Nothing difficult in use, and even if it was VDC provides a technical service number right on the manual. That number is also on the unit. They even answer it quickly - I know, I called them to start the warranty on my purchase and to inquire about the free battery tester they will send you for registering your product.Enough with the literature and literacy. The VDC BatteryMINDer 12248 will charge/maintain up to six batteries at a time with full-time desulfation. This is why I wanted it. It also has low amperage draw in use, and provides temperature compensation - also important in my hot Southern US climate. An earlier purchase of a BatteryMINDer 12151 (engine compartment mounted style) proved to me the patented BatteryMINDer desulfation technology works - and works very well (see my 12151 review here at Amazon - ""BatteryMinder 1.5A or BatteryMinder 1.3A? (chuckle) Like the ""Tortoise and the Hare"" When Compared To Some Chargers."").The 12248 still isn't the fastest charger with only a top output of 8 Amperes, but it's not the tortoise the 12151 is either - when recharging a dead battery. Is desulfation faster using the 12248 instead of the 12151? Possibly, but not necessarily. The 12151 just can't charge and desulfate more than one battery at a time, and it only charges with a reported maximum of 1.5 Amperes - although I have seen a 12151 charge at 1.8A for short initial start-up periods. The 12151 is also designed to be permanently installed to a vehicle, whereas the 12248 is a ""bench"" charger that can either be hung from a bench or used sitting on a bench - it also sits on four rubber pads for this.This model 12248 comes with the $20 temperature compensator with ring terminal option supplied, and a ring terminal battery connector with 15 Amp fuse for a permanent charging connection to a vehicle mounted battery. All terminal connectors and fuses are also supplied with well fitted caps to prevent corrosion from moisture and to and keep out dirt. It also has the standard spring clip connector with 15 Amp fuse. Nice wire lengths have also been supplied to all cables that make connections simple in most any proper use of the unit.The only caveat I've noticed is the temperature sender cable pins can be connected wrong if not paying close attention. If you look closely, you can see a minus and positive sign at each connection terminal that should be observed when making the electrical temperature cable connections. A red marking for positive would make this connection much easier, or pins that only fit one way.I plan to update this review as more use is applied to the 12248 with various batteries. (chuckle) Nothing quite like an on-going accounting of product performance.My first (far reaching) trial:settings: 8 Amp, Standard lead-acid, temperature sensor clamped to the negative battery postA thirteen year old, 75DG size group, Grand L 3010 HST Kubota diesel tractor standard lead acid battery that somehow still hangs on despite it would no longer start the tractor it came with. After about nine years of good service, up until it wouldn't start my Grand L, this battery was replaced with a new one and forgotten in a corner of my garage. This battery had a swollen case and plates, and had been sitting idle and untouched for roughly five years in that corner. One month back, I had put a quick charge on this battery and had it reading 12.6 volts when I immediately started using it for some very light electrical duty. Over the next several weeks I continued using it a few times to power a car radio system I was working on in my garage. It was still showing 11.4 volts when I connected the BatteryMINDer 12248 and made the proper settings. The 12248 accepted it and began charging it. After 30 minutes, I used an Amprobe digital meter to check the voltage and amperes being put out by the 12248 at the battery - they were; volts@14.01-14.02, amperes@.10-.12 with a solid green charge indicator.July 28 - (eight days after connection) voltage while connected was at 13.22 volts, the same as when checked after the initial 24 hours of connection. Since day two, the voltage has remained the same and the charge indicator has been flashing. Amperes are at .16 and are the same as they were when checked on day two. Visual inspection of the plates shows the normal coloration of light and dark plates returning. The case end swelling is also diminishing. Of course, I don't expect this 13 year old battery to ever be capable of supplying the heavier amperage loads it once could without self-destruction, but it will be interesting to see what it can withstand. For my purposes, this battery will only be used in my garage for temporary power on a work bench with light loads - it may even be usefull for some boost starts on equipment with weak but still marginally functioning batteries. For these purposes it should be fine, as it continues to charge and desulfate well on the 12248. A standard charger would have simply burned and cracked all the plates, and boiled the battery acid solution away long before now - leaving the battery useless with dead, shorted, and open cells. As it is, the 12248 is rebuilding a lot of capacity to this old battery.August 5 - On August 2nd I had checked this battery with the 12248 connected using my Amprobe digital meter. I noticed the voltage was varying slightly between 13.20 and 13.24. A check of the supplied amperage showed rapid changes occuring varying from .08 to .94 amperes. This peculiar amperage behavior in maintain mode is different from the 12151 BatteryMINDers I have installed to two of my vehicles. I removed the charger and checked the battery after a twelve hour ""rest"". The battery showed 12.70 volts. I reconnected the charger and saw the voltage initially increase to 14.5, and then begin dropping. Amps were initially steady at .10. After two hours, I checked and found the charger back in maintain mode and again at 13.20-13.24 volts and amperage varying from .08 to .94. I checked again today and saw everything the same - except the case swelling now appears almost gone. During the time the charger is off this older battery, I've been putting it on a year old 78DLG Duralast Gold 800 CCA battery from Auto Zone. This battery now shows 12.88 volts after a twenty-four hour rest - after each time it has been connected to the 12248. Once I'm better satisfied with the charge condition of the old Kubota battery, I plan to connect it and the Duralast battery in parallel - and make use of some of the multiple battery charging capability of this 12248. Even if these two batteries do have a large difference in age, they still match in type and are close in size group.August 23 - On August 12th I finally felt secure in how stable the condition of the old battery was and connected the much newer Duralast in parallel. There had been no changes in the BatteryMINDer output on the older battery alone, the plates in the battery were looking good, and there was no longer any case swelling. Afterwards, I fairly well forgot about the two batteries connected in parallel to the BatteryMINDER 12248 until today. Again, I had checked the BatteryMINDer output when I first connected the batteries. The voltage was staying about 13.23 and amperes were steady at .10 when first checked. Today, the voltage was varying slightly between 13.21-13.23 and amperes were varying up and down between .12-.15. A look inside, to see those 13 year old Kubota battery plates, revealed plates that now look almost new in coloration and conformation. Could it be the BatteryMINDer 12248 is restoring this formerly dead and unused 13 year old battery, that lay useless for almost five years, to an almost new condition? From just looking into the cells at those plates, it appears so after a month on the BattryMINDer 12248. After a few more weeks on this BatteryMINDer, I'm going to load test this old battery out of pure curiosity. I have the thought that it would start my Kubota diesel tractor, it came new with, right now - with no problems.Update 10/24/11:I finally got around to load testing the 13 year old Kubota battery. IT PASSED! I also used it to start my Grand L Kubota, and it started the tractor just like a brand new battery. This is an amazing recovery that makes me wonder how many ""bad"" batteries I could have saved and continued to use through the years, if I had only had this BatteryMINDer 12248. It's great to find a tool, and a company, that truly saves you money.Update 9/11/2012:I have't lost a single battery since I put this 12248 in service, and all the batteries I mentioned above are still doing fine and in service. I also have purchased multiple 12151 BatteryMINDers, and have them installed to my stored vehicles. It's very nice to just turn the key on a vehicle that has been in storage for many months and hear the engine roar to life with just a turn of the key - minus jumper cables. It's also nice to know all your batteries have been kept fresh and ready for good service by simply using a BatteryMINDer.Update 12/23/2012:The 13 year old battery finally developed an open cell condition causing its voltage to drop. At least the BatteryMINDer did give me another surprising year of use from it. I have also recharged a dead 9 year old ""gold top"" AutoZone battery and have its voltage back up. It was unable to start the old GMC pickup truck it was in, as I was unable to recover enough capacity using the BatteryMINDer on it for that purpose, but it's still maintaining proper voltage and usable for lower current draw applications such as quickly checking 12 volt parts for operation or temporary 12 volt lighting during a power outage. So, some batteries will just be too far gone in one way or another for help from a BatteryMINDer. However, I have recovered two expensive Odyssey batteries and a now 6 year old sealed Delco that are still working great. One of the Odyssey batteries is 8+ years old and used in a Trans Am with a high compression V-8 - and strong Kenwood amplifiers in that car. The other sits in my antique '57 Ford 640 tractor. I was able to recover both of those batteries to 100%. The Delco had died several times in my 2007 Silverado before it was four years old (I replaced it with a new battery after four years). After recovering that factory Delco to 100%, I put it back in my Silverado and have had no more trouble from it. I did add a BatteryMINDer under the hood of that truck, as it has parasitic draws that had even killed the new battery I had placed in it. I brought the new battery back with this BatteryMINDer and placed it in the old GMC pickup. Overall, BatteryMINDer has saved me around $600 to date - and I really like that.made in china"

62329,0,I got this idler pulley for my first truck a 1989 F-150 with a 300 straight six engine. While the pulley was the correct diameter it was about a half inch thicker than the original. So when I went to start the truck with the new pulley it hit the bracket behind it and began sparking. So I turned it off immediately to figure out the problem. All I had to do was put a washer behind the pulley to give it a little space between it and the bracket and it was fine but just fair warning.

At this price, output and size, it's pretty sweet."
100700,1,"It took some digging but this was the OEM replacement for a 2006 Hyundai Tucson's rear wiper. Per some other forums the mounting peg is slight smaller than the holding socket on the Tucson, so it needed a couple wraps of electrical tape to be able to ""snap"" into the holder. However, I think that's an issue on Hyundai's part, not Anco. Works great."

24325,0,"I installed these Big Shots pipes ($450) on my 2006 Midnight Warrior. The first issue I had is that the heat shields are attached to the pipes using hose clamps. This means that when the pipes are installed, two hose clamps are visible near the back wheel - cheesy. The brackets that were furnished for mounting the rear pipe section and the rear brake cylinder had peeling paint and corrosion -not impressive at what I consider premium pricing. The muffler bracket was very heavy - could have been drilled or sectioned for lightness at this price.The moment of truth came when I fired the bike up - a glorious but ridiculously loud sound. In my neighborhood, this hooligan din level would make me persona non grata so I ordered the ""quiet baffles"" which should be standard equipment. Again a ding on quality - I had to re-wrap the fiberglass on the quiet baffles because they would not fit in the pipes. At $26.99 each that is a poor show. They do work as advertised though. The bike has a solid bass tone but not the deafening and thunderous rasp with the standard baffles. One of the stock baffle retaining screws was stripped also :-(Overall I recommend these pipes for those looking to liven up their stock Warrior but I feel that at the price paid, I should not have to deal with quality control issues or pay for overpriced poorly made baffles just to get a reasonable sound level. The sound is much better than stock and judging by the change in mixture richness I am guessing there was a pretty big reduction in backpressure. I have not had a chance to ride the bike yet."
6841,2,"I bought these chains based on the great reviews on Amazon. But like another customer had stated, these chains were too small to fit on my 205/50R17 tires despite the fact that my size was listed as compatible on the product AND I followed the installation instructions to the letter. I eventually had to go to a local auto store and pay full price ($30 more than the Amazon price) for ones that fit. What a waste of time. So if you have 205/50R17 tires, you need the Super Z6 model SZ131.Other than that, the product was of very good quality and neatly packed in a nylon bag including instructions and plastic gloves."
109144,2,I am very disappointed with the product and the seller. The filter arrived in a wet torn cardboard box with no other plastic or wrapping protecting the filter so the filter smells like wet cardboard. It appeared to be used or least damaged it had no brand number or name with it.It also was supposed to be a filter kit and I received a torn smelly filter that I will not put in my truck because it would then make the truck smell. This has been a very bad experienced for me and I do not think I will buy on line again from amazon

80075,2,I ordered two of these NGK C7HSA plugs and neither will spark. I had the local auto parts store order some for me and they work OK.I would request a Return Material Authorization number but it would not be cost effective as shipping equals the value of the items.This is a first with me having any problems with products sold at //amazon.com. The plugs were not packaged correctly and took a beating on their way to my house.
45971,2,I should have listened to the other reviews in regards to the waterproofing or lack thereof of this product. Took a trip from Florida to new York unfortunately it rained the whole trip back. Unfortunately all my luggage was soaked and some clothing was ruined.This is an excellent product on dry days. It managed to hold 4 carry on size suitcases securely. Spend a little more and get something water proof not water resistant

96307,1,"2nd winter with this one. If you care about your car you will not buy it though. It does the same job as any other scraper and brush. The handle and quality is all there, all work great, but the scraper and brush being both on the same side get in the way of each other. So if you care about beating up your car a little, as in trying to brush and the scraper part hits your car, its inevitable, try getting one that have the brush and scraper on opposite ends. Hopkins makes a couple of those as well and I would definitely trust their quality from my experience with this one. Probably end up giving this one to my dad n getting another."

170473,0,"As another poster pointed out, it's designed to slowly recharge a battery - it's not a jump starter. I bought this product about five years ago for my 1997 Ford Explorer and it always worked great. I later purchased a 2007 Ford Explorer but never used the charger although I would periodically recharge it. This morning, my car wouldn't start and I thought, 'No problem, I'm prepared.' and hooked it up. It initially didn't charge the unit, so I turned it off and tried it again but this time with the key turned to the ACC position. Still wouldn't charge. (When it's not charging, you'll hear a series of beeps.) I've concluded that some cars have compatible wiring and others don't. (I suppose there is also the possibility of a battery that's so dead, it can't be recharged.) I went to the Black and Decker website but there's no online instruction manual or any information to let you know in which vehicles it can/can't be used.I ended up giving it 3 stars - it was great for one of my vehicles and worthless for the other. If you buy it, save the receipt. Try it right away to see if it works with your car. Otherwise, return it."
176230,1,Haven't tried it yet since I purchased it for an emergency. But it seems good. I will let everyone know once I actually use it.
123358,0,"I purchased a pair of Bosch Icon Wiper blades for my Infiniti (after much research) hoping to solve a wiper lift issue I had been experiencing when my wipers were on high speed. At freeway speeds in the rain, every bracketed wiper that I had tried would lift up from the windshield mid-wipe. I saw that these wipers had an aero-dynamic design that put downward pressure on the wiper blade while in use, so I decided to purchase a pair in order to try and solve my problem.Initially, I was impressed with the Icon. Even pressure, sleek design, and no lift! But unfortunately, after a month, the wiper started to miss wiping towards the edge of the blade. ""No worries,"" I said to myself at that time. ""It's only the edges that are not wiping.""I tried to remedy the problem by cleaning the blades during at every fill-up by wiping down the blade in order to remove accumulated dirt on the wiper. The missed wipes would come and go after that.About 6 months into using the Icon, the end caps on one of the blades flew off. I didn't think this was much of an issues since it didn't affect its' functionality. But it did hint to me that these blades may have been manufactured poorly.About 10 months into using the blades, I noticed that my wipers started to streak and smear the water instead of removing it. It would also miss wiping the water that accumulated towards the center of the wipe area (about a 3"" wide band). As another reviewer here said, it felt like looking through wax paper.The wiping became worse until today, 12 months since I had first put the blades on, when I decided to replace my wipers.On one hand, the wipers did their job for the suggested life of the product. I can't knock Bosch on that. Every car care expert recommends cleaning the blades often to extend blade longevity and to also replace wipers every winter season. I'm just disappointed that they only made it to exactly 12 months and not any further. And not to mention all the problems I had along the way.My final analysis on this product is that if you had a bracketless wiper come with your car (OEM), then stick with that type of wiper. But if you had a bracketed wiper come with your car, you might not be well served by switching to a bracketless version, especially the ICON's (or the RainX Latitudes, manufactured under a different name but the same physical product). They're 2x as expensive as a regular wiper, and last only about 12 months.You're probably better served by buying an el cheapo wiper and replacing them more often."
157524,2,"This radiator repair product is a two part epoxy putty that you knead together before using. My sample seemed to be quite old, however, since after mixing it was too stiff and dry to adhere to the radiator surface. The liquid Permatex epoxy product worked better for me."
102579,0,"I bought this inverter to use my laptop/phone charger/GPS in my truck. It works really well as described. Three things:- Be prepared in case of overheating the inverter automatically shuts off(computer, saving data).- There is a processor checking the car/truck battery level and when it becomes too low for the next start, turns the device off. Sounds good but can be wrong(don't turns off in time!). Use this feature with caution, experience the consumption of your devices and the battery power- find the balance. The safest thing is still the running engine!- The two sockets are too close together. A wide phone charger blocks the other one.I've been using mine since 3 years without any problem."
46246,2,"I bought this while living in central New York and its accompanying blizzards. The brush was decent enough for sweeping snow off of my (compact) car, but the scraper end was mediocre at removing ice and eventually lost a corner, rendering it useless.You'd be much better off just buying a separate large brush and something like theHopkins 13014 Ice Chisel 10"" Scraperinstead."

I also seem to remember cutting up my arm during the install, from the angles I had to reach inside the door. This mostly due to the design of the door, but I was very happy and surprised when I had this install done in about 30 minutes.The regulator is much better built then the stock piece, so I hope it lasts. It does raise the window MUCH slower then the stock driverside, but I have read this is to prevent damage to the plastic parts of the regulator.In closing, I just wanted to get across that these parts are CHEAP compared to the same job on other cars, and the install is easy in comparison!"
170436,2,This product was purchased with the idea of keeping it in the car for dead battery issues. When I opened the package the battery would not take a charge. As instructed I returned the product to a local Black andDecker repair facility and was told that a new one would be sent. Two weeks later a check for the amount I paid was sent by Black and Decker. They no longer make the product. The retail vender must have known about this and reduced the price to empty his inventory. The interesting fact is that the product was recommended by Comsumer Reports.

18905,1,"Although sold for automobile bulb sockets (for which it works great), this product is actually silicon grease. ""Dielectric"" means that the silicon grease is an electronic insulator. See also Fantasea Silicon Grease Lubricant, ""for all types of O-Rings""Although ordinary automotive grease is very damaging to rubber products, silicon grease is great for ANY rubber products, and for use on ANY electronic connection (other than high-voltage switches). Not only does silicon grease prevent corrosion at electrical contacts, it also improves existing contacts.THE DREADED BLUE SCREEN OF DEATHAfter about 5 years of flawless operation, recently I got a ""blue screen of death"" on my computer, mentioning a parity-check error. Attempts to restart the computer just brought up the same ""blue screen of death""---I could not even get to the minimal Windows configuration for trouble-shooting. I removed the memory boards, cleaned the contacts with isopropyl alcohol, applied a thin layer of silicon grease to the contacts on the memory boards, and reinstalled the memory. Since then (a year ago), the computer works perfectly.More recently my other (ca 10-year-old) computer has been getting progressivly flakier for about 5 years---if I opened and closed several demanding applications and/or surfed the web extensively---a lockup or crash was likely---so I routinely rebooted several times a day to avoid the lockups/crashes. Occassionally, even freshly booted up, I could not access certain files or folders (the only solution was to clear the recycle bin, delete the file or folder, and then restore it from the recycle bin). Running registry repair programs and other diagnostics did not help. Completely reformating the harddrive and reinstalling Windows and all my programs from scratch did not help. A new harddrive did not help. About once a month, the computer crashed with a parity-check error message---which began me thinking that I might have a similar problem with the memory board contacts. So during my last annual ""spring cleaning"" of the inside of the computer (particularly the CPU cooler), I also made a point of pulling the memory boards one-at-a-time (blowing any dust out of the contacts with canned air), applying silicon grease to the contacts, and reinstalling the memory boards. Since then (3 months ago) the computer has been working like new. REALLY!It would be a good idea to coat the contacts of any boards or memory with silicon grease before installing.EXAMPLES OF AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRIC USESDoes your car refuse too start when it's been raining for days? You could replace the entire ignition harness (for perhaps $100 plus labor)---or just coat the wires with silicon grease, being particular generous at the spark plug and distributor connections. No need to wipe off excess. Also pull off the spark plug wires (one at a time so you don't confuse them) and put a dollup of grease on the contacts.Replacing your car battery? This stuff is far better than the petroleum jelly your father used to protect the contacts from corrosion.EXAMPLES OF PLUMBING USESIs your bathroom faucet leaking? Disassemble it, clean it, and rub silicon grease into all of the rubber seals. Let it set, wipe off excess, reassemble. Does your toilet run on and on after you flush it? Same solution.EXAMPLES OF USES AS A LUBRICANTIs the A/C plug for your juicer hard to push into the socket? Add a generous coating of silicon grease and stick it in and out of the socket several times to lubricate the socket. Petroleum-based grease or oil may conduct electricity and burn---making the connection worse. Silicon grease will not conduct electricity nor burn.Is the door lock of your car stiff? Same solution, slather silicon grease on the key, and lock/unlock the door several times.IMPROVING ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONSDoes the right or left channel of your headphones drop out or sputter? Silicon grease will improve the connection.Do you have to shake your TV remote to make it work? Silicon grease will improve the batteries connections.Have you noticed? 40 years ago leaking battereies destroyed uncountable flashlights and transistor radios. Everyone knew that you had to remove batteries when not in use. But then battereies improved in the 1980s and 1990s and almost never leaked. But once again, batteries are leaking and damaging equipment. Silicon grease will at least protect your contacts from minor leaks, and will improve already damaged contacts.RECONDITIONING RUBBER PRODUCTSDoes wind noise at high speed because of a poor door seal drive you crazy? Coat the seal with silicon grease. Rub it in, let it set, wipe off excessDo you have a classic car with stiff dried-out rubber seals? This stuff is first aid. If they aren't too dead, silicon grease will bring them back to life, and protect them from further deterioration.Sliding windows in your van hard to open/close? Coat the channels with silicon grease.Within reason, you cannot use too much. Unlike ordinary oil and grease silicon grease does not attract dirt.CAUTIONSilicon grease is NOT a replacement for petroleum-based grease as a lubricant for continuously moving mechanical parts. While silicon grease can ""recondition"" rubber belts and rollers (in computer printers, etc) it can also make them too slippery to do their job (instead use CaiKleenTM RBR Liquid, oiler dispenser concentrate 25 mL). Silicon grease can interfere with repainting cars---so it is best to avoid getting silicon grease on painted surfaces, particularly if you anticipate repainting the surfaces in the near future. In high-voltage switches, arcing can create silicon carbide which will deteriorate the contacts.To see my""How to Repair electronic devices damaged by bad batteries"",""How to Improve Rubber Seals or Revitalize Rubber Items"", and""How to Improve electrical connections"" guides,click on ""See all my reviews"" above, then click on ""So you'd like to know"" guides on the left side of the page"
155241,0,"The mirrors appear well made and fit my truck perfectly. That's the good news. The bad news is installation...not the difficulty, but product design issues.The first issue is there is one 10mm bolt per side that you need to install. This bolt is to self tap (although not a self tapping screw)into the mirror's aluminum base plate. The bolts are too small (or the holes to large)and the bolts won't stay in and strip out immediately. There are 3 holes in the base plate. One would have been good but this is not the hole that could be used due to alignment...to back up my ""hole"" argument, the bolts, when the mirrors were unpacked, were already started in the hole that had to be used. So a trip to the store and a purchased of 1/4-20s solved the problem. Very poor design.The second issue is when tightening the nuts onto the pre-installed studs, I stripped one out. If there are torque limits this was not itemized.It all comes down to being cheap....not using inserts in an aluminum casting. Flat out cheap."

With this modification and a few others my computer estimates my mpg to be around 27 in the city. I have even seen it jump up to 35. To me this seems very high so I would say maybe 20 mpg. This higher than the stock mpg so I am happy with these numbers.. Using my computer I see there is no difference in charging and cooling. Doing some research on bbk's website I found out that they actually decrease the size of the crank and increase the size of the alternator and water pump. In doing this the belt does not have to be replaced. I still need to take it on a trip and really test it out but as far as acceleration I would say that I am a very happy. If you have about $300 to buy and professionally install this underdrive pulley kit it is well worth it."

102897,2,The CarPad works fine when new but it didn't last as long as I had hoped.The vinyl dries out and cracks after about 2 or 3 years and then it no longerprovides much value. It would be nicer if they used a better quality vinyl.
98934,2,"This wrench is not working at all. When I got it, I figure that I need to buy a handle, then I tried the handle together with this wrench. Guess what? I can only unlock the filter and couldn't lock it....? The people in the auto parts store, laugh out loud at me....after i told them how how I paid for it. The expense to send it back can let me buy a useful one from the store. .....VERY DISAPPOINTED."

63548,0,"There are no instructions with this tool, not that they are necessary but it would be helpful. I wanted to remove a good windshield from a junk car and replace a cracked windshield on my daily driver. It only took about a minute to crack the good windshield. I have fairly good mechanical skills but would take blame if I thought it was my fault. The installer may have used too much adhesive, but I believe this tool is only good for removing worthless glass and not to salvage glass. So much for trying to do it myself. Even with the handle I was not able to pull the tool all the way around the windshield. The first cutter blade is already bent from less than on use.As another review stated wear gloves, the screw holes and slot for the blade are not chamfered. The machined edges are quite sharp and until several layers of skin are gone you don't notice the damage to your hands.In review:No instructions includedToo easy to crack the glass for a first time userSharp machined edges cut skinBlades are only good for one windshield each."
14890,1,"I've seen immediate great results from using this product on my car windows... My GPS device suction cup now sticks so well that I have to pick at it when removing it for storage. Previously with multiple cleanings of Windex and ""Clearview"" (an alcohol/acetone based window cleaner) The suction cup would soon loose it's grip, usually while I'm driving in rush hour traffic, so I would have to place my GPS in the cup holder area until I could find a place to stop and place it back on the windshield. Overall the product works the best out of any I've used in the past(you should see all the others in my garage) no streaks, especially on the outside of the windshield where the road salts of the northeast often leave a smeary residue. Great inside the house too. You can see how clean the mirrors are when the sun shines on them at an angle. Only one concern... I like the clean smell of this product, but it's too strong for my wife when first applied."

The Jelly Blade really does help reduce the time you spend drying your car.The design of this tool allows for an easy grip that conforms to almost every curve of the car.I use this in conjunction withClean-Rite Microfiber Cleaning Towelsto get a nice dry car. The jelly blade removes the bulk amount of water and the Microfiber Towels soak up any left over water, leaving no streaks.This is a must have tool for anyone who washes their own car."

33769,2,"This seat cushion worked fine last winter. However, when I took it out of storage this year to reinstall it, it didn't work at all. I also agree with other reviewers that the fastening straps are cheap and don't do much of a job of holding it in place. I only paid about $20 for it, though, so it's cheaper than having heated seats factory-installed, even if you have to buy a new one every year."
106818,0,"I was a little disappointed with this multimeter overall. I've used several different brands in the past, and this one seemed like a nice, cheap model for general diagnostic use. It gets the job done overall, and is very usable, but what struck me was that the continuity test on it is TERRIBLE. You can just touch the test leads together when it is on the audible tone for continuity, and it will take MORE THAN A SECOND to produce a tone. This might seem like nitpicking, but when you are troubleshooting a circuit it becomes extremely annoying. The other negative quality is the test leads are super cheap, dinky hard plastic that just dont have a very good feel to them. Positives are that the back light is very nice, I can see it being very useful if you are doing some car repair or something outside at night. Overall, it is pretty usable, I would have really liked it more if it weren't for the crappy continuity test."
33698,1,I got this heated seat cushion for my wife as a surprise about 2 months ago. She absolutely loves it. She still thanks me 2 or 3 times a week. It fits well in the seat and it warms up very quickly; much more quickly than the engine. I would recommend this product.

141229,0,"The construction seems solid enough, but be warned it's not intended to be mounted outside in the weather. Mount it on your dashboard under the windshield.The current produced is extremely small. You WILL NOT charge a battery in a day or 2 with this panel. It says ""Maintainer"", and that's what it is. It will only provide enough power to keep a battery from going bad.

128533,0,"I started reading the book ""Our Band Could be Your Life"" recently, in which Husker Du is but one of thirteen bands profiled in the survey of American indie rock. Intrigued by the author's insights on the band, and always a sucker for a cool band name, I decided to try a little H-D myself and picked up this EP at a local store.First off, if you aren't ready for it, this EP can be a bit disconcerting at first. More into the doom-and-gloom of Joy Division or the warped but still musical punk of the Sex Pistols or Buzzcocks, I wasn't quite ready for the buzzsaw intensity of the first two tracks. ""It's Not Funny Anymore"", however, broke up the ""headache hit parade"" long enough for me to enjoy it throughly. The next four songs also went down easily enough, though I wasn't really sure I'd keep it.Now, it's a few days later, and as I type this ""First of The Last Calls"" is wailing away in my head. I can't say I would've like H-D on only one listen, but now the EP has grown on me.The reason I give it only three stars (apart from the fact that I do way too many ""five-star"" reviews in which I come off as a ""I'll like anything!"" kind of spaz) is that it's something that has to grow on you if you don't naturally go for the hardcore punk sound. Even Mission of Burma sounds tame compared to ""Real World"" (which should've been used as the theme for the god-awful TV show of the same name, he said wickedly), and I'm not so sure I could take more of the same everyday, all day. But in the context of Nirvana and the whole ""grunge"" movement (which I detested until it left the scene and no good has come of music since) it's fantastic.So in other words, not my normal cup of tea, but I like it now that I've given it a chance. That's the most you can ask of anything you've never tried before. Will it lead to harder stuff? For me, perhaps no, but that's just an individual call there. Pick it up if you want something different from the pop muzak of today, and if you want to see where Nirvana got their sound.Oh, and ""Diane"" is a nice cousin to ""Excitable Boy"" in the annuals of true-crime songwriting."

155075,2,"Coverking gave Amazon the wrong information for these floormats. Do NOT buy them for a 5th Generation Passat Wagon, as they are meant for a 4th Generation Passat Wagon! I bought these mats for my 2003 Passat Wagon (which is a 5th Gen wagon), and the passenger side mat is way too wide for my car. The width between the holes of the passenger side mat is quite a bit wider than the width between the pegs on my Passat, so the holes of the passenger side mat do NOT fit on the pegs in the car.I had to email Coverking photos of these mats as well as of the original mats that came with my Passat, and this is what they told me:""It looks like the item you ordered is for 1998-2001. If you have a 2003, then you would need pattern: VW9273.

186826,1,I have 2 of these lights and they work well for what I use them for. They generate a lot of light for a an hour or so. I did buy 2 of the more expensive Brinkman lights that were supposed to hold a 4 hour charge and both were defective and had to be returned. I think the 800 is the best light for the price if an hour of light is enough.

86791,0,Great shine with the product however you have to be careful about applying it on the car. I applied it over the entire car and then went back to wipe off the haze. It was almost impossible to get the haze off and in some areas on the car it still is. No caution on the instructions to do one panel at a time which I HIGHLY recommend. However the shine is amazing on the areas that did wipe clean.
177295,2,"Hi. This is a good unit, BUT, like the previous review stated, the rubberhead requires A LOT of pressure on the head due to stiffness to removethe moisture. It places considerable pressure on the bottle top andsqueegee head, causing it to split. Had less than a year, a great conceptwith the two together, but they need to improve durability. Thanks.Paul"
99984,2,"It's kind of a pain to empty used cooking oil, so I was excited to try this. The following aspects make it dissapointing:* The motor is underpowered. It empties the oil slowly, and sometimes you have to turn it off and on several times before it ""catches"" and actually starts to move the oil.* The food sediment in the oil sticks to and clogs the filter. To get it off you have to stop the motor, let the food bits fall off, and then start it again (which might or might not happen the first try). Maybe this happens with all oil filters, but no matter what it makes the experience with this one frustrating.* It requires three D sized batteries. You're not supposed to leave batteries in things that you don't use frequently, so depending on how often you fry you might end up putting in and taking out the batteries every time you use it.To be fair, even though it didn't live up to my expectations I still use this instead of just draining the oil through cheesecloth or something."

127934,0,"It's a nice straightforward tire gauge, with a dial light that makes it easy to read in dark corners of the garage. The one problem I've had with it was that it quit working after two weeks (I check the pressure on each of two cars once a week). Investigating, I found the batteries dead; replacing them got the gauge working again. Conclusion: Either this gauge is shipped with near-dead batteries or its battery consumption is way out of line. If the brand new Energizer 357 batteries I've just installed die any time soon, I'll revisit this review."

I removed the unit to test it and that' although the solenoid would click quite forcefully, the drive gear would not extend. Upon removal of the solenoid, I noticed that the lever that moves the gear in the housing was made of plastic(not sure if they are all that way or not). I suspect that the solenoid became dislodged from the lever. I re-installed the solenoid after making sure the gear and lever were free, and the starter worked again. I am not going to take a chance by re-installing this unit again."

15245,1,"Before buying the Accutire MS-4020GB Digital Tire Gauge, I was using the typical manual gauge which wasn't giving me a precise measurement of the pressure in my tires. Now, with this gauge I can have a better lecture when I put air into my car tires. This is helpful since most of the times you need to have the recommended pressure on your tires according to the car or tire's manual. It has a nice hand grip, very easy to use and it measures pressure is in 0.5 psi incremental. I do recommend it for those out there who are looking for a more precise measurement, instead of using a manual gauge. I did in fact reviewed other digital gauges out there in the market, but I went for this one due to its low price and the manufacturer specifically makes measuring systems which gives you more confidence regarding support and other technical issues."
56979,1,"When the dash board tire indicator lighted up, I checked my tires and found a screw punched into a rear tire close to the side wall. I tried to go to a shop to patch it from inside, but was told this tire was not repairable because the hole was close to the side wall. I went to nearby Walmart to buy a kit by the same maker and similar to this. I followed the 3 step instructions printed on the back of the package. It is easy to push the glue-coated stick into the hole. By quickly pulling out, the stick was in place. Then I inflated the tire with a small air pump. After it reached the recommended value, I dropped a few drops of soap water at the repaired hole to see if there is any leak. No bobble! Fixed! It takes about 30 min. I highly recommend this kit."

24002,0,"Until I received this filter, I was not aware that this is actually a re-usable filter and so it can last over 200,000 miles. However, there are a few important issues. To use this filter, you must follow the directions to wash and lube the filter with a special kit. So, this will add to the overall cost. This is the reason, they sell this so cheap (somewhat similar to printers - where you have to keep on buying expensive inks). The MAJOR ISSUE is however oil contamination of air-flow sensor. The oil from the filter can drip and contaminate the air-flow sensor and screw-up your engine and performance. My friend at the local Toyota dealership (service manager) stated that the damage from this type of filter costed a few of his clients about $ 400+ to replace the sensor. So, this will be the last Airhog I will buy. If you search internet on this topic, you will note that use of this filter is a very contraversial issue. I will not take a chance."

109415,1,"After reading the other reviews here on Amazon I was a little apprehensive. It did appear that the more negative reviews were the older ones. The company that makes the gauge itself has also switched hands so I took a chance.The gauge is fast and accurate. You have both a digital readout and a bar readout around the circumference that is reminiscent of an analog gauge. The digital readout gives you a reading to a tenth of a pound and is MUCH larger and easier to read than the bar around the outside edge. The readout changes on the fly even while bleeding air. The hose is very soft and flexible. The connection on the end is awesome. The seal is great. Not ONCE have I bleed air unintentionally while trying to make a seal. The clip is solid. You can clip it on to the stem and let go and it holds on tight. The blue backlighting is bright and even.I have no idea why you would want to clip it on and monitor the pressure for more than a second but you can if you like. The hose also remains pressurized after you disconnect it from the tire. This permits you to stare at the reading for up to one full minute. You can tap the bleed valve to reset the gauge or just plug it into the next tire and the pressure equalizes with the tire to give you the new reading. You do not have to hit a reset button (The reset button picture in the product image is now just the ON button. There is no reset button). The only time you have to press the bleed valve to get a reading is if you leave pressure in the hose and let the device go into standby while still pressurized. When you turn it on with pressure in the hose the display reads ""BL"" prompting you to press the bleed valve before taking a reading.The bleed valve button is easily usable while holding the gauge in the left hand. It does not bleed air terribly fast but you are apparently considering the purchase of a tire pressure gauge with a decimal point; you are obviously are O-C-D enough to want to do it right. Of course the readout is not accurate while it is bleeding. Is an analog gauge? No. You have to let the bleed valve close to get an accurate reading.The flexible hose is a blessing and a nuisance. It's great because it allows you hold the gauge comfortably and easily see the readout when the tire stem is in an awkward position. On the downside it means you have to use two hands to take a reading. My old gauge was a little one piece analog number that allowed me to press it to the tire stem while holding the compressor hose in the other. On the whole the benefit outweighs the disadvantage for me.The gauge is larger than I expected. Including the rubber grip/padding around the outside it is about 2 and 5/8 inches across and 1 and 3/8 inches deep. I'm a six foot tall guy and it fits very comfortably in my hand. It may be too large to hold solidly if you have small hands. The hose is 12 inches long which sounds unnecessary but it's actually just right.Lastly... It's an LCD display. This means that it's polarized. It is viewable from all normal angles. It is not visible when viewing from a steep angle above or from very steep angles on the sides or from below. You can't see it if you're wearing polarized sunglasses. It's far from a problem. You will not have trouble reading the display under any normal circumstances.Final thoughts: It's a quality product. Buy it."

84082,0,"I've used helicoil before where you drill, screw in and break off the tab and it worked great. This is different because you are inserting a coil into a wall instead of a hole if you know what I mean. The tapping device worked great and I question to this day if I should have stopped short and left some aluminum between plug hole and open cylinder because you screw in the coil with RTV and let it set before putting in a plug.

62988,2,"Purchased this valve cover set for my 1995 Honda Accord with 2.2 engine. All parts in the set fine except the most important one, the valve cover gasket. Gasket is slightly off spec, with biggest problem being that it does not fit very snugly into the groove in the valve cover. (Yes, I know how to put the gasket on without stretching it, I've done this lots of times in the past with no problem). As a result, the gasket does not stay in the groove when you turn the valve cover over to place it back on the engine; and because you can't easily see the gasket once the valve cover is in place, you can't tell if you've gotten a proper seal or will leak oil. Next time will spend a bit more and buy the gasket set from the dealer, as not worth the hassle for the few dollars saved."

These are NOT alloy steel, but cheap carbon steel, not heat treated but coated to look like they're annodized. Upon inspection, the die threads aren't even deburred. I'm afraid to try the taps because I'm sure they'll either snap off in my parts or bend.Overall impression: typical of Great Neck tools - minimally acceptable at best, dangerous to use as a primary tool. Better to only buy quality taps and dies as you need them or deal with a reputable company's products. The only parts of the tool set I use are the tool holders."

The items was supposed to be mounted on a 1999 Ford Econoline Full-Size Van. The contoured shaped, which is nice to protect the body around the splash guard where it is mounted, does not adjust. The entire splash guard is made out of a stiff material and does not adjust to the shape of the vehicle body around.If mounted, there would be either a rather large gap at the top between the flap and the vehicle body (which would allow debris and water to run into and sit there), or the flaps would be in an angle which would look awful.The Powerflow 6416 Pro-Fit Splash Guards, ordered at the same time, were a perfect fit, you might want to check out the description and review there.[...]"

126912,0,"I bought this charger because I have a car I don't use very often, the battery was almost dead, and I was tired of taking it to the shop for a slow charge every time.

My car battery is the 36MR - 700 in the chart from this link [...]I read the chart from the charger manual in the section ""Calculatint charge time"" finding mi case in the ""24 to 46 hours"".

The charge was a great full for my car both in the start and reserve situations so far.I haven't tested the charger as a mantainer.About the Speed issue, I didn't found anything inside the owner's manual about this charger being fast or anything; not even in the overview features, so it's not good that the box, and the page advertise this one as an Speed Charger. In the ""Calculating charge time"" chart from the manual, the charge time goes from 2 and a half hours for motorcycle and garden tractor (best case scenario) to 46 hours for worst case scenario in trucks and marine deep cycle batteries, including the warning about the charger not working if your battery is totally discharged.

51467,0,"I looked at this and one of the ""150 watt heating pad"" units & wasn't sure which was best, so with both being ~$25 (where it's not like buying a car) I got one of each (figuring I may put one on a car and keep one for other uses). One of the places I wanted to be able to use them was on a small engine (like for a generator or snow-blower) and with those having an aluminum block (where the magnet won't stick) I got a steel plate ~1/8 thick I could bolt up to the engine base. I put this heater on the plate (without it on the engine yet) & plugged it in, after 1 minute the plate seemed totally cold still. I pulled the plate off and put my hand near the unit where it's base was warm, so put it back on. Apparently, the magnetic bars (that we assume holds the hot iron to the plate) stick out enough that it leaves a 1/16-1/8 gap between the base creating the heat and the attached plate. I'm not sure if that's intentional (giving the magnets full contact to be sure they hold it where placed), but the heat either needs to ""jump"" the air gap or all be funneled thru the little magnet bars to get where you want it to go. If we're talking about temps of 20 or less where you want to warm an engine, having the air gap around it doesn't seem great to me. After leaving it for 1/2 hour the plate did get up to ~130 degrees, but that was it (so this does have temp controls that cycle it on & off shown from the max temp and I checked the power draw). Seeing another review of ""The plastic melted on multiple units"" make me wonder how it'll hold up in the long run.I then tried placing the ""heating pad"" unit on the same plate (after cleaning it as per instructions and putting a bead of silicone around the edge that needed to dry). With it plugged in, the plate is too hot to hold within 1 minute (~140 degrees) and gets up to ~200 within another minute even with the less power draw.So my conclusion is if you want good/quick heat transfer, the heat pad unit seems better with full contact putting the heat directly on what you want to warm. If you want an easy to slap on unit (that can be removed), this one may be good. Either one needs bare metal for where it's placed, so I see no real difference there (they both say ""Don't place on painted surfaces cuz it'll damage the paint, so strip off any paint if there is any where you want it"".)Note: If you're wondering ""How do you warm a generator engine with power out (which is when you need it)?"" I have a deep cycle battery & inverter that should work for 1/2 hour, then with the gen going I can recharge."

The reply did note that the particular code I asked about was related to emission controls but that is too broad an explanation to isolate a problem. You can buy upgrades for the code reader but description of what you get is also vague, therefore anyone buying an upgrade would not know what they were getting.On the plus side I was able to find code descriptions on the internet but it was not easy. Once I had the code I bought and replaced the defective part and the problem was solved.

I'd have liked it to do diagnosis on transmission and Auto-HVAC and to change factory settings on operational functions where applicable, but then again, the machines that can do that cost in the thousands of dollars."

134702,1,"I switched my '08 Mazdaspeed3 over to MT-90 after the initial break-in period a couple of years ago. Shifting was noticably smoother, and I'm pleased with how much easier I can get into gear on cold mornings. I replaced the fluid after 30k miles, again using MT-90, and I don't foresee switching to any alternative at this point. I have nothing but great things to say about this stuff, though I've heard a few people encounter a little noise out of the LSD after using this fluid in the Speed3."
26362,1,I tried alot of tire clean/shine products bought from retail auto stores until I stumbled across this product. I gave it a try and this is the only foam I will ever use!Most tire spray sold in stores are glossy and I didn't like the looks of it after putting it on. This product is a true showroom tire foam. It doesn't make the tire too shine or too dull. Just right. This is the same kind of detail when you walk into the dealer showroom and see how clean and new the tires are. This product has the same effect and it lasts long!

167221,1,"I bought these un-reviewed as the Neiko brand similar tools shared much of the same feedback; the Neiko brand was too flexible.I am glad I took my leap. These OTC tools were perfect for my task; fixing a broken door handle and broken window limiter (electric window rails/holder).These tools are firm and perfect for removing wood trim and door panels. Nothing got broken in my car using these tools and they were invaluable in getting the job done right the first time.The set includes a full range of tools and the tool ends work on many different jobs (disconnecting fittings for example). They are all plastic and won't scratch or damage your car/paint.I highly recommend these as I've used them twice now, even fixing a broken fuel hatch spring on my wife's truck.Every do-it-yourself-er needs these in their arsenal."
27730,0,"Fits in my 2002 Lexus LS430, although Amazon says it doesn't. The Wix website has a handy tool to find what fits your car.Cheaper than the OEM alternative, but quality is lacking. Significantly less pleats than the same model Wix filter I got a couple of years ago locally (Made in China), and made with flimsier material. 33 pleats in the old China one vs 27 on the new Poland one. Who cares if it's made in Poland when the quality is less than the one made in China? Shame on Wix for cutting quality. I was tempted to give 2 stars, but this product is probably still decent for the price.Not sure how many pleats the OEM filter for LS430 has, but you can probably get it for around $30 at your dealer or online.The one shown on the product page (as of Dec. 2012) is the old Made in China model. You can tell by the black foam sides. The new one has white foam sides.Disclaimer: I am not a filter expert. Please comment if my opinion is wrong."

73978,1,"Im very happy with this vest.. plain and simple.. I have another vest that I spent a lot more money on, but I had since lost a lot of weight and I didnt want to start to spend the money or the time by resizing it.. So I orderd this vest.. The price was much less than the original vest I had purchased.. The quiality was much diffiernt, again so was the price.. With all that being said , I really like this vest.. Its light weight comfortable cut very nicely. The price is perfect for what you are getting... This isnt a waste of money. The side laceing is nice as well . The quality is exactly it need to be on this vest. It was a cheaper priced vest but the quality was not. This vest isnt a bunch of scrap pieces of leather cut together with a millios differnt sew patters either. The size was spot on no issues there. If you are looking for a light weight inexpensive vest which also is a quiality vest.. this is it. There are much more expensive vests out there that have thicker leather, and better lining and other little extra touches. Im very satisfied with this vest. I gave it 5 stars based on the price for what you are getting. It is money well spent. There is a left interior front pocket.. very large compartment .. You can hide ANYTHING in there... the right side has a inside pocket as well,not as big as the left interior but a nice pocket and its convient, and two smaller exterior pocket which finish the vest off nicelythey are also convient pocket as well. Lining is thing.. but who cares the price is great."
72294,1,"works great, easy to install,fit perfectly in air box. to install on none touring model with mock tank you open door to gas cap.remove all screws and 2 on front of tank. be careful, tank is 2 seperate parts. lift up instrument panel.slide tank apart a little, remove screw, lift out filter, put in new, put in screw, slide tank parts back in place, insert instrument panel,run screws back in. It is a good idea to have someone help you by holding the instrument panel up out of the way due to wires attached and so you dont scratch the tank. Also, when removing screws, look out for washers, so when you lift instrument panel, you dont lose them or drop them in the gas filler tube, because gas cap must be removed."

I'm stuck with it I guess! I like the ""velour"" kind, they're not really velour but a more plush then the carpet type. I don't care for those."

51897,1,"If you never used a short throw shifter, I recommend you give it a try. It's throw is so much shorter than the stock shifter that once you use it you will think the stock shifter felt like rowing a boat. The quality is excellent. The installation is a bit of a chore so if you aren't mechanically inclined I recommend you have it installed professionally. If you are used to doing things yourself, you can get it installed in 1 - 2 hours."
129854,0,"Purchased from Amazon, on the very first use, was leaking (sucking air) from the top seal. I had to put a clamp on it to finish the oil change I had started. Called the company, they acted so surprised I was having issues but sent a replacement top gasket. After taking it apart and cleaning many tablespoons of grease they use to try and make it seal, put the new gasket on, only to have it leak again. Asked it I could have it replaced and they said would have to work through my place of purchase.Amazon did come through and replaced it no questions asked. Tested the brand new one, and of course no surprise, it leaked as well, in the same spot. Called Mityvac again and the finally admitted they were having some issues. I sugggested they have a QC problem in China where this is made and they said there is someone over there all the time to correct this (it's not working).The concept is great, just a problem with execuition. I took apart the new one, cleaned all the grease and using permatex silicone form=-a-gasket resealed the unit (retained the original gasket, used the permatex as supplimental sealing. That seems to have done the trick and it now works as intended."

However, I don't think His Noodliness (Parmesan Be Upon Him) would like that this very light weight plastic piece is sold for 10 dollars + shipping, as it is not worth more than 5 dollars including shipping, if you are going to charge 10 maybe 5 of it should go to feeding the hungry or something. It is about 5 1/4 inches across and almost 2 inches from top to bottom. Moreover, there is only a small piece of tape on the back (about 2 inches long & hardly 1/2 an inch thick) and as of right now I am not sure how well it will hold & I am worried that when the emblem flaps in the wind while I am driving His Noodly Appendages will scratch the paint on my car. It has been really cold and wet here, so I have not tried to put it on my vehicle yet as I am afraid it wont attach right due to the cold and will fall off. Right now this gets a 3 star rating, I will give this a 4 star rating assuming it doesn't fall off after I attach it to my car when the weather warms up. I am also thinking of adding some more double sided tape to the entire back of this so it stays on better and doesn't scratch my car."

89145,1,"This is certainly a step UP from the usual 4,500 watt ""budget"" generators! Very easy to assemble and a wonderful heavy duty unit that will power MOST of my house in case of electrical problems. Be aware.. you will still need to probably purchase a transfer switch (around $400) and cable (another $50) plus a couple hundred more for installation if you want to do it the ""RIGHT"" way, however, I figured that in the event of a power outage, it is MORE than worth the cost. I purchased this item when there was free delivery, which was great, because the shipping company said that it would probably have been an additional $200 for shipping this item! I also got a $50 rebate and the price was quite a bit lower than it is now, but I still don't think you can go wrong with this unit. The large fuel tank is certainly a plus! Of course, the delivery company met me and delivered it to the ""street"" (I had to drag it UP my driveway), but it was well worth it for the price (free!). Porter Cable has a great reputation for this equipment, and I'm looking foward to giving it a full test as soon as my power drops out this winter."

There is no inlet pipe on this unit and I would not have known this before buying-it is in small print on the instructions flyer that came with the parts. Installation requires a flanged inlet pipe to attach to the cat and as it turns out the tail pipe did not fit- went up against the frame and still misaligned with the existing cat, so this is not a DYI product-had to spend another 100$ to have a piece of pipe welded on and pay for an inlet pipe and installed by the muffler shop. Would not repeat the purchase. The unit sounds good though."

186454,1,"I am very pleased with this kit. I was looking to give my 2004 Lincoln LS V8 a little more kick and this kit did the trick. I am kind of car savvy, but no expert. This took me around 1.5 hours to install, mainly due to unclear instructions. Nothing is too difficult otherwise, it just requires the time to put the puzzle together of how everything fits best.I immediately noticed a sound and performance difference once installed. The deep growl under increased acceleration is noticeable at any speed, and I think it sounds awesome! I don't appreciate too much of a whine at higher RPMs that other reviewers of these types of kits have mentioned. I may be psyching myself into it, but I do notice a performance difference as well, which is always appreciated. I wish I could comment more on if it is giving me better gas mileage, but due to me wanting to accelerate more quickly and more often, I am getting worse mileage overall, which of course is my fault.I recently coupled this with a Magnaflow cat-back exhaust system:Magnaflow 16678 Stainless Cat-Back Exhaust System for 03-05 Lincoln LS, which it does help my car sound and perform even better given the higher flow tubing and mufflers. IF I were to choose one over the other, I would go with the intake as it is a much better value with possibly even more performance and fuel efficiency than the much more expensive exhaust kit.I am so pleased, I plan on installing these intake kits on all of my future cars."
95065,2,Text claims it will fit a 1985 GMC S15 Jimmy. Doesn't even come close!! I tried to go to the listed website for help and just got bounced around to different search engines.

73041,2,"These lights ""appear"" well made at first. But after they got wet, internal condensation started after a light rain. Amazon replaced the first set without a problem. However, the second set does exactly the same. Careful review shows that the lens is not sealed all the way around. I contact Hella (who owns the Optilux brand) and they say the opening in the lens seal where the humidity enter ""...is designed to be that way"". Go figure - allow humidity in? This reflector will rust over time with that condensation.These are very cheap Chinese made with the Hella brand on them and obviously no QA from Hella.I am returning the second set for a refund and looking at other brands."

69282,0,"Charger will hang in auto mode as mentioned by others. I find I cannot trust it, so I keep an eye on it. One thing I wanted to mention: this is rated as a 15 amp marine charger, however, when you buy it and read the manual provided it says to use the 10 amp mode not the 15 for marine batteries. This also will top your lead acid batteries at 16 volts. Some might consider this too high for regular charging. Personally, this item is usable, but I would not leave it on untended."

35864,2,purchased this product online to save 150.00 when the item arrived the battery was dead. no problem put it on charge and it will be ok. wrong battery would not take a charge. this item must have been sitting in a warehouse forever and no quality control was ever considered about looking into this. then after that problem was fixed the fuel filter on it kept clogging. there was setiment in the tank but the filter itself was just to fine for a fuel filter. after replacing the filter with a generic inline fuel filter and replacing the battery the genset itself worked good. take this revie for what its worth i will never order anything this big offline again i will pay the extra 150 to buy at a local dealer that way someone is close by to take care of the problems instead of having to do it myself.

I used their ""non-scratch"" pad, followed the directions, etc., but it did leave minute ""spider-web"" scratches, most visible when the sun is directly shining through the windshield. Granted, my car has 165,000 miles on it, and the windshield already has numerous small rock chips in it, so in my case, the scratches are better than the water stains, but if I tried this product on a newer car and it did this (although the product claims it is safe on windshields), I would be very angry indeed."
39526,1,This product is an excellent design for my 8' bed on my F-150. Installed in less than 20 minutes as advertised. C-channels support the cover excellent and the no-snap design of the closing is excellent. Does very well in the high winds of the Texas panhandle! And it's made in the USA - highly recommended.
116579,1,"Purchased for my wife's Honda Accord. It helped to lay the dash mat flat for a couple of days before installation. After installation, it gradually relaxes and fits the dash very well. The velcro pieces are a bit tricky to place on the dash but not too bad. Also, be sure to have something to clean the dash before hand so the velcro sticks better. I highly recommend this product."
138168,2,"I got this tonneau cover and had high hopes due to the many positive reviews. I don't know how someone could be happy with this cover unless they just use it to look pretty and haul grocery. If you need to haul something big and have to constantly open the cover, then don't get this cover. I wish I spend about $350 and get something more useful from amazon. Now, I'm selling this thing for $100 on craigslist just to get rid of it.Pro:1)This tonneau cover was easy to install and the works well if you just want something to keep the bed dry and save some MPG.2)It seals pretty good. I don't see a drop of rain of snow.Con:1) The cover is too stiff to row back due to the seal n peel. You're going to need two people to get the cover nicely rolled up. Just imagine what you're going to do when it's extremly cold and you need to work with this cover.2) The rear bar over the tailgate won't come off because it's firmly held in place. Pretty much need to loosen all side clamps to get the rear tailgate bar off. Example, if you need to haul a Fridge, you can't because that rear tailgate bar is in the way. Lund will not provide a solution for this over sight either. If I can't think of a solution to this problem, I'm going to have to sell it at half the cost."

63444,0,The ball mount by Reese does what it was designed to do. It would have rated higher except that when it left the factory someone must have tightened the bolts that need to be moved to fit the shank with an impact wrench.

I did not follow up with Amazon since the part was functional. This is the second time a used part was shipped as new. The first part was an oxygen sensor for the same vehicle. It was in such bad condition, I returned it. Amazon provided a new replacement.Looks as if vendors who supply the parts tag everything as new even when it's obvious that is is not.

With a little help from customer service (wires were different color) it does work, but it would have been nice to know in advance that is was not an OEM for my car. Seems to be a bargain purchase for me and would recommend this product with the above comment."
130866,0,This sunshade does the job it's intended to do but it is impossible to put up without bubbles and it does not cover the whole window of our Honda Accord. It does allow us to roll our window up and down without the shade from falling off. The light that comes through the shade is still fairly bright but I think it does decrease the intensity.
51417,0,"I purchased these fans primarily to help with cooling while towing a heavy trailer up hills and mountain grades. The did help some, but they did not solve the problem. The do a great job of making the A/C very cold."
17297,1,"I chose this brand of wheel locks because I have used these in the past on another vehicle and am very happy with the product.They are nice looking and well made.These particular ones I put on our 2012 Ford Edge with 20&#34; wheels and they fit perfectly,even with a narrow opening.In my opinion these are the best wheel looks out there."
20750,1,A nice addition to the Olds. Price is right and it adds to the value of the car. Fits perfectly on our 2003 Olds Alero.
99890,0,they are fitted to the car but for 111 dollors you would think they would have the factory holes so that they will stay in place... nope.. so as far as fitment goes they are cut to fit my car but they do not go all the way down bc those plugs hit it..
63338,1,"This is a good looking and neatly tucked away hitch,hugs the rear bumper much better than the one I had on my van before.Perfect fitting took me 10 minutes to install not counting routing the wires and all.I would recommend this hitch,it's strong,wel made and will last a long time.This one hitch states it's a class III hitch,but can be a class IV hitch as well."
55793,2,"The original set of struts lasted ten years, this replacement is bad after only two years."
158743,0,"it took me 6 hours to do it , i won buy some thing like that again,unless it's custom made which will fit even the wheel,do not take wrong looks good on it now but it's not tight around the spokes"
22908,1,Used this product on a 1991 Nissan Stanza for the power steering leak. Worked great. Have had good luck with Lucas Products.
48616,0,"I was led to believe this unit had a rechargeable battery in it. For such a small unit, the idea is to be able to take it and use it where ever you go. A real pain if you have to always plug it in. Otherwise the unit works fine."
99274,0,"It fits sorta okay but it is very wrinkled and two months later it still doesn't lay totally flat. I'd have to say it is better looking than a cracked dash, but not by much"
160328,0,"It works, but I wish it pushed the window up 1-2 seconds faster. The slow speed is definitely noticeable :("
21591,1,I was sick of missing the tailgate bezel like every other chevy pickup around. I checked amazon and was very pleased. Very Cheap price. Seems like a Quality product. Easy to Install and very fast shipping. I Can't ask for more.
129604,0,"If you aren't familiar with this class of rust treatment products, this is a rust converter, not remover. It works by chemically reacting with the oxidized iron and producing a black paint-like surface. In the absence of rust, it just produces some staining. This product does not remove rust, so you need to prepare the surface by first removing loose rust.The product is water based. That means cleanup is fairly easy before it has dried. (I usually apply it with a foam brush, which I then rinse off after.) But this also means that if you apply too much product on horizontal surfaces, the pooled product can actually cause more rust. Additionally, the product directions do warn to let an item fully dry before top coating. And that you can't top coat with water-based paints, unless you use an oil-based primer.This Permatex 81773 version doesn't seem to behave any differently from other brands of rust converters that have the same milky tan appearance. The product page here claims this version is ""Body Filler Compatible,"" but the bottle itself makes no mention of that. More importantly, it says, ""NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AUTOMOTIVE EXTERIOR SHEET METAL REPAIRS."" (No explanation for why this is the case.) Ummm...that kind of makes the body filler issue irrelevant, as automotive exterior sheet metal is the primary place where you use body filler.I thought maybe Amazon sent the wrong product, but I verified the item number matches."
77715,1,"The blade seems to be working well. My only complaint is that the part finder on Amazon told me to get the wrong blade, so I had to return the other one and get this one instead."
178470,1,"I bought this product for a 2000 Jeep Wrangler. The product fits fine, and performs as advertised. In the past, I have also had the same problem as the reviewer who could could not get the top to fit. Bestop is at fault for this problem. They tell you that when you buy a Bikini Top, you can choose to attach the top to a permanent windshield channel (that you must attach by drilling) or to a temporary channel (that you bolt on). They make it seem as if the top will attach to either channel. The reality is that there is actually two different Bikini Tops (one for each type of channel). This product will only fit the drill-in channel. The product number the one-star reviewer had was for the bolt-on channel."
25726,1,"I've owned one of these for a number of years, and it's a very handy and accurate gauge.To the folks who complained about erratic readings - did you try fresh batteries?"
65762,1,"Why would someone buy this? Because their heater and/or defroster doesn't work in their car, right? Why else would you buy it? If the reason that you're thinking about buying it is b/c the heater doesn't work in your car then forget it; don't buy it. It won't heat up your car, not even a little bit. But if your car's defroster doesn't work, go ahead and buy it. It doesn't do as good a job of defogging your windshield as your car's defroster does (if it worked), but it's better than nothing and for less that 20 bucks it's money well spent. It would be nice if it blew more air and heated up more. That's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5."
70701,2,Don't let the photo fool you. It actually is a pin connection not a post connection. Look closely at the photos. The photos show two different connections (which I didn't see the first time). The pin connection is extremely hard to connect.
110219,0,"haven't actually put it to the test, but I can say it does not fit a 14"" element like I thought it would.... maybe fits K&N 's. own, which I do not have... mine is a fram ""air hog"" 14"""
29607,0,"Made out of abs but does not have the same diameter of 3"" abs. Had to jury rig it in with a 2 1/2"" rubber coupling. Worked good once we got it installed."
4818,1,"I received it today and it fits the FasTrak fine, maybe a little more loose than I expected but fine. On the package, it says ""A perfect fit for your Colorado E470, Northwest Parkway, and California FasTrak electronic toll pass system"". FasTrak and the east coast EZPass are not the same size and shape so if you have EZPass I would look for a holder designed to fit that toll tag. If you are having your signal blocked by this holder, you might be using it wrong. One side has no plastic, that is the side that goes towards the windshield. The other side is half covered by plastic, that's the side that faces inside the car."
8657,2,Low quality product. Oil cooler fittings leak. Fan screw to short to be use. Hit are condition expansion tank. Do not buy!!!
35199,0,"Installation was simple and straight forward. No performance gain at all. No loss either. I say it's just a pretty yellow factory replacement. One down side though, the metal that is exposed rusts fast unlike the factory coil which is encased in plastic. Save your money unless you just happen to need a new coil."
162339,1,"Great tires, we love them. the price was right!!! they shipped quickly too!! , now I""m back having fun."
116095,1,Product fit perfectly and operated as expected. It required some knowledge of mechanics to replace the old unit that most could quickly and easily learn. The unit was marked with the Chrysler logo on the housing which may indicate it was from the original supplier. Very please with the item and shipping time.

26651,1,"Oil cap, good quality, enough said! I was looking for a slim oil cap for a project I'm doing on my Ford/Mazda PCV system, and this was a perfect fit. Shipping cost almost as much as the cap itself but it was well worth it to find the perfect shaped oil cap."
76092,1,"This mat is made of heavy duty rubber so you can roll over it again and again with your car. Once set in the right place, it works much better than hanging the old tennis ball. When the car hits the flat part right before the bump, the mat holds still. You roll over the bump with one tire and you are parked just in the right place. I love it."
74009,2,"I bought a new MOAB basket and extension for my 2010 Xterra. It has many pros but here are the cons for other buyers:- Mounting System Sucks. This is the same system we were using to mount things on roof racks in 1970! Two bolts and a piece of plastic on each of the four mounts... C'mon!On top of this disappointment, the bolts were too short and I had to go get longer ones to fit my Xterra. I had to find 8- 2 1/2"" galvanized carriage bolts with the threads over the whole length of the bolt.- I would have thought the extension would join the front and back parts of the basket with the same type of hardware on each end. On one end of the extension I have a solid respectable joint with a cool ""Thule"" logo, and on the other end I have four cheap round plastic connectors. (The basket is not as solid on one end as the other, and in fact it ""hinges"" at the back end - When I step up on my back bumper and grab the basket, it pulls down because of how wimpy the extension connects to the back section of the basket.Thule needs to re-engineer these issues before I will recommend this product. I suggest they look at how Yakima mounts their Cargo Boxes with a one-touch clamping system...I ran out of threads on regular carriage bolts.Also, the wind deflector is thumb-tacked on the front of the basket with plastic keepers that take unhuman strength to push through the deflector/plastic clamps. I don't trust them to stay put, especially in the winter, and both my thumbs were injured installing them. Poor system. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BASKET FOR THESE REASONS."
4547,1,"I bought this to read and clear trouble codes but the X-Gauge displays are great.Installation was very quick. The OBD connector (at least in my Honda) is not buried in the wiring under the dash. It's mounted on the bottom edge of the dash sheet metal just above the gas pedal, very easy to find.I mounted the ScanGauge on my steering column cover with the supplied velcro in a few minutes. It's very light so the velcro works and it blocks only part of my odometer.It displays your choice of four gauges and many of the 'gauges' are things never available in a 'gauge' before like instant, trip and ave. MPG and intake air temp. The data is fascinating."
163499,1,Arrived in a timely manner. Was reasonably priced. Worked well when put to use.
123495,2,I consider this a poor choice for a suction gun. It was one of the most expensive suction guns that Amazon offered so I expected it to be one of the best. It has good suction but when you pull the plunger to the top it squirts the liquid that you were using it for for all over you. If you buy one of these expect to get squirted in the face. I will try one of the less expensive ones to see if it works better.
127970,2,I thought this would be a good tool kit but I'm so not impressed by the cheapness of the product. The tire pressure gauge is PLASTIC. And I found it a bit hard to get a reading. I'm so glad I kept my old fashioned metal gauge because it works accurately every time.
40387,0,"Well made, and clearly machined by excellent manufacture - but with key fobs containing the essential lock and unlock, panic and trunk open buttons, this becomes redundant. I wish it were not so, but it just gets in the way of other gear in my pocket."

They appear to be of really high quality construction.Although they won't get much use before springtime, I expect they will be just what he needed as a replacementfor canvas ones that are totally worn out.

500,1,"I am very happy with this product, espically for the price. I would recommend it to anybody. Very good quality."
95567,0,"Brought this as overkill protection against flats while commuting. Used it multiple times and it does inflate tires effectively. However, after about 6 months of use, the battery didn't hold charge for very long. I think the CO2 canisters are as effective and more reliable for better price. Bottom line, this was a nice to have when it worked flawlessly."

The corners are recessed making it very easy to neatly pour the oil out into a bottle for disposal.I very much like this product, and i would recommend it to my friends."
14249,0,"The product description clearly says, ""Includes an emergency siren, and a built-in cell phone charger with multiple adapter tips"". After reading many accounts of how it is possible to lose contact simply because of not being able to recharge a cell phone, I thought this a very good feature in a ""disaster radio"", and it is the feature that motivated me to purchase the radio.I was surprised to find that the radio not only doesn't include ""multiple adapter tips"", it doesn't have even one, in fact doesn't have even a cord that will plug into the socket labeled ""cell phone"", and this socket is also nothing like any standard cell phone cord would plug into.[added later] Not evident in the product description, the ""normal procedure"" is to, after purchase, contact customer service, who will send you the proper adapter for the cell phone you specify. [end addition]I contacted Eton customer service. To their credit, the reply was quick, but to the effect of, ""tell us the cell phone model and we will send one cord, but no other adapters"".I'm less than thrilled with this radio. It seems OK, but the light is dim (2 LEDs), the radio reception is spotty, hard to tune, and the carrying case is too small to fit the radio and the charger."
13810,2,well this was supposed to be for my truck and when it came in it looked nothing like the picture and it came no where close to fitting my truck dash! it was to short and completely different than what they said i was getting... compared to the picture... i paid about 35 dollars for a piece of crap that doesnt work... thanks alot!

I am a fan of the regular liquid Astroglide lube and thought that a thicker version would be better for anal play and that it would last longer. I do not find that to be the case with this.

187008,2,"I installed this on a stock 2 barrel carburated 1968 Ford 302. I discovered this is a ""narrow band"" unit rather than a ""wide band"", as many other air-fuel ratio monitors are. Apparently the narrow band units will only read a very small range of air-fuel ratios which must be near 14.7:1. Because my engine is an older carburated type, the carburator does not provide a constant and stable fuel mixture at all power and loads and it does vary from a constant 14.7:1. The K&N indicator flashes and goes blank regularly depending on throttle and load and provides little information which can be used or interpreted. This unit is almost useless for me. It might work on a newer fuel-injected engines but is of no value in an older engine."
28152,0,"I bought this unit for the area where I keep my cats' litter pan. I ended up using it elsewhere because it's just not efficient enough to filter out all the litter odor before the fan propels the air outwards into the room.I use it in the main living area and it must be helping because when I change the filter, it is positively caked with dust. Ew.5/29/11 UPDATEI purchased the replacement filters specifically for pet odor and the difference is noticeable. They are much more effective at removing kitty smell from the air. I have moved the appliance back into the cat litter pan area and I am very happy now with its performance."

96498,1,"I bought this to jack up my 4Runner. It is sturdy for 3 ton, but a little short for a SUV. So I have to be careful to be sure the chassis bar stay on the top of the jack stand when I lower the jack. Otherwise, it is very good."
134959,0,"Unfortunatly this kit was shipped in it's original box. The extra clear shipping tape used to strengthen the box was a nice touch. So now I have a kit with no hardware due to the container that arrived with a hole in it. Amazing this kit was not shipped within another box. A good design for the ramp ends though. I wanted the kit with the alluminum wraping the board on the bottom and top of it. The sandwich effect would have given the kit the extra support needed for my motorcycle. I was unable to coordinate that order for that style. Try it and you will know what I mean. So I figure I will use some stong pan washers with some stainless hardware I haven't purchased yet. Between Rampart, Highland and Amazon's websites, no contact numbers to address the shipping disaster, I would rate this as a disappointment. Clearly a possible home run if one could actually get the product they had hoped for."
22841,0,"It's simple, they're poly bushings. If your car has rubber bushings on it these will stiffen things (I won't get into arguments about if that's good or bad, if you want to stiffen the sway bar on that end of the car this will do it).The problem is that the grease hole in the bushing doesn't line up great, and if it's enough off the grease will squirt out between the bushing and the shell instead of going between the bushing and the sway bar. It should just be a bigger hole, I'm not sure why they didn't do it. I installed front and back ones and initially 2 lines up and 2 didn't. I was able to get one of the ones that didn't to line up, the other is just not right. At some point I'll pull it off, freeze the bushing and just drill a bigger hole in it.(FWIW, I wrote the same review for the front bushings since I had the same issue with one front and one rear, they were different sizes)"

86627,0,"You are not allowed to gap these spark plugs, which makes it difficult to make 100% that they are fit for your car. In my case, these plugs did actually give better mileage somehow, but I don't think that is as important as making sure you car runs SMOOTHLY (rough idle) and correctly. I went with NGK spark plugs the day after I put these in and the idle is perfect in addition to starting up quick. Fuel efficiency isn't quiet as good, but it may be my driving style.Bosch is...

178620,0,"I ordered these because these appeared to be similar to and yet less expensive than the PIAA ""Super Silicone"" wipers that I've been using with some success for several years now. Put them on a '99 Jeep Cherokee along with the matching 13"" blade for the rear window. A few comments:1) the PIAA blades come with a little silicone impregnated wipe to prep the windshield. These don't.2) These work fantastically. Possibly even better than the PIAA blades (perhaps because of the lack of the prep wipe?) The PIAA blades smear ever so slightly. These don't. However a windshield on which the PIAA blades have been running is darn near impregnable to dirt, bird nasties, etc. - nothing sticks. I do have a couple dried-on dead bugs on the Jeep which don't come off by using the squirters.3) They are significantly less expensive than the PIAA blades4) I have not had them long enough yet to comment on durability, but the PIAA silicone blades last darn near forever, so I have similar hopes for these ones.5) And now the negative. The metal part of the blades is finished in a glossy, black metallic paint or powdercoat. I much prefer the semi-matte black finish of the PIAA blades; on a sunny day if the sun hits them just right they glare into your eyes just like the old polished stainless blades from the 50s and early 60s. There's a reason we went to first matte stainless and then later matte black painted wipers... and these are a step back.So five stars for performing their ostensible function and doing it well, one star for the poor choice of finish. I may pull them off, remove the inserts, and wave a spray can at them to make them a true five star product, but I shouldn't have to do that."

96348,1,this tank looks well built. It should withstand pressures up to the 150 psi advertised.It is the right shape so it can be mounted in places that don't afford much room.
33356,2,"I purchased this item because it showed the complete mounting set which includes if you look at the picture -- the bolts, washers, retainers as well as the cab mounts. When I received the order the only thing included in the order was the cab mounts --no bolts, washers or retainers. I talked to a representative from Amazon and he also thought that they should be included and reordered the item for me and we again received only the cab mounts. I cancelled the order and reordered the item from another company. How disappointing. So if you just want the cab mounts this item is fine. The listing should be corrected immediately."
157032,2,"Purchased these Feburary of this year and have had ample time driving in the rain/snow with these wipers.The 26"" wiper blade rubber is either too hard or the arch is too stiff. As a result, only the edges of the blade clear water. Unfortunately the entire middle of the blade just smears the water across the windshield. I've sometimes had to drive looking out either the top or bottom left hand corner of my windshield. The smear is so uncomfortable, that I feel it is affecting my normal vision and I may soon need to wear glasses to correct for the bluriness.However I've noticed on longer drives that the wiping/smearing gets better. On my hour long morning commutes to work, I find that the wipers perform decently by the end of my trip. Thus, pleasant and not an issue after some 45 minute break in period. But if you are like me, you might find that first 45 minute period to be excrutiatingly frustrating.Of note, shorter lengths perform pretty well."

I hope other customers read this review before buying anything from this website.Mis-lead customer.

In less than 2 years the straps were torn due to the mounting hardware having sharp edges. I think that this net is overpriced. The only difference between the cheap net and this one is that this one has the pipe on the sides of the net to hold it up. Shipping was ok"
146992,1,"Installed these recently on my 2003 V6 Accord with 120K miles on it. It was the exact model recommended by owners manual, which also recommended Denso plugs in addition to NGK. It even said that my current plugs could be either brand. I decided to go with NGK based on reputation, price and availability. Spark plugs are supposed to be replaced at 105K miles, but since the car did not have any issues, it just keeps running like new, I waited a little longer.Installation went quickly and easily. Plugs were pre-gapped from the factory, no messing required. Interestingly enough, the plugs I pulled out were Denso, not NGK. Did not matter. Started the car to make sure everything is OK. It was, and since than I put about 20K on the car. No difference in performance, all is good.Based on my experience, I trust Honda to make the right replacement interval recommendation. There is no need to replace them before 105K miles unless there is mechanical problem. These irridium plugs really do last. I am very happy with this product and recommend it to others."
176096,2,"Nobody seems to like this product, so really no point in beating-a-dead-horse....BUT, since it happened yesterday, and since I'm back to Amazon to buy a replacement (ALTERNATIVE) product, I was compelled to comment.

112357,1,I bought this off Amazon because it was the cheapest price and offered free shipping. I had it in 2 days. It came packaged very well and in great shape. I have it installed in my truck camper and it works very well. Starts right up and puts off alot of heat. Cant wait to really try it out once it gets colder. Would like to see them offer this unit with an accesory kit that would provide you with a piece of flexible hose and several connections. You only get the heater. Any connections or fittings have to be bought separately. Its still a nice unit and Ive heard from others that use them in their RV's that they really perform well.
76198,0,"First, the pros: It works. It holds the jack handle to the jack standard. That's the primary purpose of this product, and it performs THAT job admirably.However (the cons): It's a big, tough, hunk of expensive molded plastic, and it doesn't have enough clearance for the bolt and nut of the clamp attachment at the top of the standard. Installing and removing the keeper with the attachment in place is tough to begin with; in below freezing weather, it's a real pain in the neck.If you don't have the clamp attachment installed, it will work great.I suppose one could cut off the parts that interfere with the clamp attachment's bolt, but I think I'd rather put a section of bicycle innertube around the handle, another around the standard, and cinch a $0.85 thumbscrew-style hose clamp around them to hold it all together."

Then just the other day, as some idiot blabbing on their cellphone, not paying attention to the task at hand (driving), begins to pull out in front of me from a side street, I go to lean on the horn to get their attention. Nothing! A collision was narrowly avoided, but it could have been widely avoided if the horn had worked. No previous sign it was about to die on me, it just did, when I really needed it to function."

48838,1,"I just got this tonight so if something changes, i'll revise my review, but i wanted to share the info that i got it at Lowe's, paid on line with in store pick up, for $31 plus tax, total $34. I was about to buy it on Amazon, i have Prime shipping. My preference was to buy something locally because i have an immediate need for it, but i couldn't find any AC air pump locally after a couple of days of searching. But then, i found this at Lowe's today, with a serious price difference--so if you're thinking of getting one, Lowe's has a good price.I've never used one of these before. I have a 12V, very cheap, that i got years ago and used a couple of times when my tire was leaking, it worked fine. I forgot i had it. I recently got a new car and had new tires put on the car, and wasn't sure if they were leaking air--anyway, i needed an air pump i could use at home. Going to the gas station got old after a three days in a row of it.Based on Amazon reviews, i was between the Bion-aire and the Black and Decker 120v pumps. Both had overall good reviews.I didn't like the info i read from a couple of users about the Bionaire warranty--or lack of.Pluses for the Black and Decker were: the automatic shut off and the AC/DC option. Also, it was a couple of pounds lighter than the Bionaire, making it easier to carry from tire to tire. So I decided on the Black and Decker.I wanted to set the auto shut off for 41 psi. One of the user reviews was helpful in explaining that the gauge is not precise enough to accurately set the pressure, so you can approximate it, going over a bit, and then check with a real gauge, and let some air out to get the right amount.The operation is very straight forward. Plug it in, turn it on, watch it inflate, it doesn't take very long.But I had trouble with it on the first attempt. I set the dial for roughly 42 or 43 psi, the dial is straightforward, you turn it to the number you want (roughly). Then, you turn the power on.What happened was, the tire started out at 33 psi and i wanted to get it to 41. When i turned the power on, the pump made a very short motor noise and then immediately went silent. I tried different sequences of plugging things in and turning things on, but it wouldn't inflate. If i turned it on without attaching it to the tire, the motor would run, but as soon as i put the chuck on the tire, the motor would shut off. If i connected the chuck before turning the machine on, the motor wouldn't come on at all.I figured out that even though i had it set for a pressure that was 10 lbs more than the pressure it was starting at, the machine thought that my tire was already at the pressure for auto shut off and it was shutting itself off, even though it was 10 lbs under my preset pressure.Then, i had another problem. I wanted to readjust the pressure dial in various ways to find an adjustment that would let it inflate my tire. First i turned it down to zero, but as expected, it wouldn't turn on. Then i turned it up high, 100 psi or so. But then the gauge needle stuck at 120 lbs or so and i couldn't turn it lower. I was thinking it was a bad unit and wasn't going to work, disappointed.I remembered that one user review said that in between tires you have to turn it off and then back on again, but it was turning itself off. i tried the switch. it didn't seem to have any effect. But at some point, things got freed up and i was able to adjust the preset pressure lower than 120 lbs. I put it at 50 lbs. Then i turned it on and it worked properly. It began filling the tire, starting at the mid 30s where it was, according to my real pressure gauge. In about 30 seconds to a minute, it got the pressure up to 42.5. I used my real gauge to let a little air out and then it was at 41.5 where i wanted it.Whew.Then, after that, the other tires were easy, i just did what i did on the first tire minus all the groping around, trying to coax it into working. Once that was achieved, i was very happy with how it worked. It was easy and fast. the unit is very lightweight and easy to carry. The chuck fit easily onto the valve without squirting a lot of air out, and came off easily as well. Once i adapted to it, it's exactly what i needed. One of the main selling points was the preset shut off, and that didn't work for me, but it didn't matter. It fills fast enough that i can just watch the needle go up and shut it off when it's where i want it.but i'm going to call the company tomorrow and tell them what happened and see if they can shed any light, or if they think something is wrong with it, in which case I'll exchange it for a new one. None of the other user reviews mentioned this. I like it, i will replace it if it's defective. But never having used one before, it may be that i was doing something wrong.After reading some of the reviews, i thought it was going to strain my ear drums, but i don't think it was loud at all. it's a motor sound. It's not as loud as the old 12v one that i used in the past. I would not call it loud. I would not think to mention that in description.I found the cord storage very easy, without the 12v cord. With the 12v cord, it's crowded, but it still fit without any real strain. Since i'm not using it as a 12v pump, i'm not keeping the 12v cable in the storage compartment so putting the cords away is quick and easy.Even though i had the difficulty getting started with it, i gave it 5 stars based on how well it worked once i got it going, i have no qualms about replacing it with another one if needed, considering that most reviewers had positive experiences so the odds would seem good."

6948,0,"I have not gotten the chance to ""enjoy"" cleaner air that the Bosch Premium Cabin Filter P3755 has to offer, so my feedback and rating will be based on the ease and nature of installation of the filter into the RX300.The following post shows you how to replace the cabin filter:[...]After removing the old filter, I found that the Bosch model does not fit into the existing plastic frame well. It is not boxed with any reinforcements (typically thick paper), so after fitting the Bosch filter into the frame, there was a gap on the 2 sides of the filter that I needed to glue or tape to the frame. I chose to tape it using thin Duck tape. So I am not convinced that this model is built for RX300. Next time, I will look elsewhere."

91409,0,"My car was stolen with this device properly attached. When I retrieved the car, the busted AutoLock was waiting for me on my front seat. The AutoLock's shorter metal ""arm"" was bent out of the way (separated from the rest of the Autolock by about an inch), and the brake pedal face bent slightly, enabling the AutoLock to slip off the brake. From articles I've read about the AutoLock on the Internet, it's length is a major weakness: it can be used as leverage to bend the (relatively) weak metal arm and disable it. Either that happened, or a crowbar was used to bend it.Bottom line: don't rely 100% on this device to protect your car. Nothing can do that. It is only a deterrent, just like the Club, and will not prevent a determined thief from taking your car. However, realizing the flaws of the AutoLock, I can say that now I own and use BOTH the Club and Autolock, and just hope that the work to disable this tandem is enough to discourage the next would-be thief."

67406,2,"we received this item and when my husband put in on to the car seat the buckles that you need to attach it to the back of the seat are very, very weak. We did not want to go to all the trouble of mailing it back to the manufacture, too much of a hassel for us, so we went ahead and replaced the buckles with the ones that came with the old life jackets. Luckly we had some old life jackets that the kids had outgrown and we used those buckles to replace the broken ones that are attacked to the cooling seat cusion. If they replace the buckles with a stonger buckle this would be a very good seat and I would rate it as a 5 star, not the 2 star that we originally gave it. So to you, the manufacture, replace your buckles with the same type that are on life jackets and maybe you would have to pay a little bit more to manufacture the seat but all in all it would be a better product. If you want to pay me for this suggestion I would be more the happy to get this money. Thanking you in advance, Salvatore & Rose"

It has also been perfect for charging camera batteries that were found to be dead right before a function. They charge on the way there! It also gives me some piece of mind for times when the power goes out. The leads are easy to find in after market or simply make your own longer ones to run from the car into the house.

129920,0,"I just tried the Mityvac 7201 for the first time to change the oil on my snow blower. Not a good experience. I read the instructions carefully and tightened the screws clamping the top to the cylinder as directed. Tried pumping a few times with my thumb over the end of hose. I couldn't get much suction and could hear leaking air. Tightened the screws again and decided to give it shot anyway. It pulled oil up to where I could see it, but stopped short of going into the container. I could hear leaking air.Changed the valve to pump the oil back into the snow blower. I could hear the air leak out as it tried to generate pressure. Got a bowl of water with dish-washing soap and tested the area between the top and the cannister. Leaks all over the place. Unscrewed the top and found some grease but no O-ring or seal of any kind. I had some thin O-rings in my shop and found one that fit. Slathered grease on the seal and put it all back together. Worked much better. I was able to pull the oil out of snow blower more or less as expected.I then had the bright idea to pump the oil into my recycling container. Switched directions on the valve, pumped a few times and oil started to come out as expected from the end of the hose. However it also came out at the connection between the hose and the top. Oil poured down the side of the Mityvac and on the floor.Other than the fact it barely worked, it was a fabulous evening. :-) Between the repairs to the Mityvac and the cleanup it only took me 2 hours to change less than one quart of oil in the snowblower. I'll see if Mityvac customer service has anything to say. Since I added an O-ring it seems to work, but I am definitely not impressed.Follow up - Customer service comes throughI called Mityvac customer service, explained the problem. They indicated that the missing seal was an issue in the past, but they had reworked the inventory. Obviously whatever Amazon has in stock may have the problem. They sent me a replacement seal. Took me about 15 minutes to open up the unit and install it. Now it seems to work fine. Creates good suction and I don't hear any leaks."

21419,1,"Excellent product and it really works! My only complaint is the laser arms are a little restrictive for range of motion. We have a three car garage and park on opposite sides. It took a little more work to get the lasers to hit both cars in a place they could be seen, but once set up, we have had zero issue. Highly recommend!"

68549,0,Design is real cheesy it comes with some junk pen and a decent bit of scratch paper. In Chicago we have a pretty hot week and it actually melted to my window (the suction cup part) so if you live some where where it gets over 90 degrees then either don't put this in your car or don't buy it. Tho after it melted to my windows I was able to razor it off and re-suction it to the window surprisingly.

70979,2,Just thought it is a little suspicious that all of the 5 star reviews have come from people who have only reviewed this product. That fact combined with the ludicrous claims of this product leads me to believe they are all plants!
158324,2,don't buy it.no wonder there is only a 30 day garanteelike one of the other reviewers said i have had it only one and a half months and it will not turn on at night anymore. the batteries are being charged and are makeing contact in the battery holder. the switch that turns it on is not working anymore.

90873,1,Works okay but may be a little flimsy for any tough riding. better used as a rear view rather than side view.
152010,0,"I got one of these for the 2007-08 Honda Fit. The box says that is what I got, but the fit on the dash is pretty bad. It is clearly slightly too wide and can't ever be smoothed out all the way because of this. The reason I got it was to keep the car a bit cooler and reduce reflections, and it does that fine, but it is far from perfect. I give it a grudging 3 stars, as there is really no excuse for it to fit so poorly given that it supposedly matches my exact car model and year.P.S. I inherited one of these from the same company with a purchase of a 2001 Honda Insight (the real Insight, not the new huge one) and it fit excellently and was of a better quality. That one was from the original owner, and it is now about 10 years old and is still in great condition."
175319,2,This spark plug wire set was fine in material quality and general fit as far as an average set goes. I'm unsure if all the sets were packaged this way or some one was just having a bad day but one of the wires was very tight between the coil and plug and I had to stretch it to make it reach. All the other cables were fine but this one just didn't seem to go in the box with the others.

55035,1,This product is just what it claims to be. A smart charger that does a float charge to keep your battery in peak condition. It came with both ring terminal connectors and mini clamp connectors which allows you to switch the charger to other vehicles. Low charging amps so long charge time but that should be better for extending battery life.
181453,1,"I purchased this impact wrench because it is compatible with a 1/2"" DeWalt drill/driver that I already own. I use it to drive 3 1/2"" joint connector screws into endgrain wooden bed rails when assembling bunk beds that I build. The 1/2"" drill/driver would do the job but I would go through two batteries to set up one set of bunk beds. With the impact wrench I can complete an installation using only one battery. Now I have 4 compatible 14.4v batteries that I can rotate between the 1/2"" drill and the impact wrench. The only negative I have about this impact wrench is that it is quite noisy when using it. Other than that I am well satisfied."
38734,0,could not give it 1 star it really is a quality part for some reason the 03 civic had or has a diff mounting plate so this mirror does not work on an 03 but really a well made part if you need a side mirror it really it the best option thanks guys.

81133,0,"After trying many different products to keep my wheels clean, I have decided that this product is just average. The small bottle doesn't last long, and the product needs to be buffed off to a sheen if you want optimal results. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it adds another step. If you're going to buff the product anyway, wheel wax is a better option. It is useful to coat the lug nut recesses and the inside of the wheel if you have a hard time getting your hand in there to buff off the excess."
49026,1,I have compared several cargo carriers and this one was the best deal. It was reasonably priced and did what it was supposed to. I would not hesitate to buy it again. Good product and shipped fast.
185586,1,"i am doing my masters in electrical engineering & i am a travel and gadget freak . i bought this inverter which is perfect to run my laptop,gps,cell charger,batery charger,camcorder when i am on the go.Buying the car adapters for all of these would cost atleast 400$.With this my car is my home when i am on road trips.I also use it to power my gadgets when i am on international tours.This is my best buy so far and I recommedn everyone should have one."

67656,0,"The price on this socket organizer was great, and when I opened it up it seemed to be just what I had been looking for. I got my sockets out and arranged them all on the board right away, but since then the majority of the times I've tried to pull the sockets off of the board to use quite often the gripper comes right off with the socket. Several times the pin that extends from the gripper that holds it to the board has been snapped clean off, which makes the gripper then worthless. It wasn't like I was applying too much force and just ripped them off by being careless, they are just that cheap. I suppose that if this board came with a bag of replacement grippers it would still be worth while, but unfortunately in a few months of owning it, with very little use, I now have several blank spots on the board, and have to use a pair of plyers to take the grippers out almost everytime I want to use a socket. Not what I was looking for after all.Ryan"

146268,0,"I really liked this little radio. Case is rubberized and the size is OK. The problem occured when the crank fell off! After talking with Eton, they recommended that I send it to a repair facility that has a set charge of $40.00 for repair. This is for a $50-00-$60.00 dollar radio. Although the warranty had expired, I wish Eton would have been a little more aware of this problem. They said that they had ""no idea"" why this happened. Would love to rate it higher but the plastic crank is a big issue, especially since I purchased the item for this feature!"

78646,0,"My 1996 Acura RL was leaking from both the front cam seals and the rear main seal. ATP Reseal worked to diminish the leaks, but did not stop them. The front seals seem to have benefited the most from the product, as it is barely leaking now, however the rear main has seen only a marginal benefit."
1562,0,"My problem is not with the transmitters themselves but rather with the way they were packaged and shipped. This device includes, in addition to the unique code label on the device itself, a facility code of an additional 2 digits which provides further security (additional uniqueness of code). This additonal code was not supplied with the device. The manufacturer normally sells these in blocks of ten (I ordered ten) which are consecutive code numbers with the facility code labeled on the outer package. The entry system is programmed to be able to enter these codes in blocks rather than each individually. I received 10 randomly coded devices thrown in a box without any packing or identification of the facility code. As I chose to keep them rather than return I have limited reason to complain I suppose. Other than the foregoing the transmitters work fine."
26954,2,Very difficult to return. They had a 15% restocking fee and I had to pay to return the product so I kept it. Won't be buying from K&N again.
51930,2,"This mat, while it is made of nice quality carpet and is bound on the edges, does not fit my Yukon 2nd row seats well at all. It is simply a rectangular piece that should be 3"" longer on each end to reach the door sill, which is the area that gets the dirtiest!"
45902,0,I got these for my dad as a temporary thing for his '01 Dakota. I had to add two extra holes because the lower hole didn't line up in a good location. Three stars because for the price they are good and will do the job (stopping the stuff they spread on the winter roads from hitting the truck) but extra holes were required.
186414,1,"What a difference from the stock seat that came with my V-Star 650 Custom. My body is thanking me for this purchase, much more comfortable for you and rider. This seat allows me to ride long distances in comfort. The only negative is that it moves you forward on the bike about an inch. I remedied this problem by putting inexpensive forward foot controls on my V-Star,now I have a bike I can ride all day."
136533,1,Excellent product that I have used before. I was looking for it and found iton the Amazon website. It is a necessity to have if your car has tubeless tires
109176,1,I usually buy these in a big box store. I saw these on line and they had good reviews. I have used them this fall and I agree they work great. They were price right and delivery was fast.
138714,0,"While delivery was great and the description was spot on, this little device wasn't what I needed for my application, as it requires a certain minimum amount of fuel flow in order to regulate. When used in a minimum pressure application (in this case, 1.5 psig)when the fuel flow stops or drops very low, pressure delivered rises to the maximum of the fuel pump, which is enough to force the float valve in the carb from it's seat. This causes exactly the problem I installed the regulator to prevent. all this is probably an ""off design"" application (generator for an RV using a larger remote tank and small electric fuel pump)I feel that the regulator should regulate...just as air pressure regulators do for example.In all, the application was a failure...sorry, Holley!"
82308,0,I ordered this tps for my 1987 jeep Cherokee I have Manuel tranny. I think the one they sent was for auto trans. The arm was backwards. When I ordered it nothing was said about tranny. So if you order this tps beware of tranny
117451,1,"Great product from Armorall, Arrived quickly and undamaged. I would recommend this seller and this product. Use it on my car seats, leather sofa and my leather jackets."
96505,1,"This product worked exactly as it should, and was virtually identical to the original inside the flashlight. It is a genuine Streamlight product. However, I think this is an older model, because it says ""for SuperStinger"", and the newer one says ""for UltraStinger"". If you don't know, the SuperStinger is an older model than the Ultra, but the only difference was the new reflector; same power consumption and battery life, so batterys are identical. Works like a charm."
152788,2,"I bought both belts for my car from Amazon. When I bought this item, it clearly stated that ""it fits Mazda Protege 1998, 1.8 liter. When I recently took them to my mechanic, one was fine, but this one did not fit my car. Since the day (Oct. 18) passed, I can't get the refund, except a partial, which will not be worthy because the shipping will probably cost as much as the ""partial refund"".So, make sure, you check with some other places, if what you buy from Amazon really fits your car, because you can't trust what Amazon said.I will try to see if I can sell it through e-Bay, even though I don't really know what type of car really fits. If not, I will probably give it away."
155013,0,The unit itself looks great. The removable gas tank is nice. Very loud...don't believe the literature. I called B&S...they wouldn't even give me the Decibel rating of the engine. I bought this unit at Home Depot and will be returning it shortly.

AND you get a different part because you didn't pay attention to the product description, you hope you are dealing with a half way decent seller.FORTUNATLY I had bought this from an EXCELENT seller. One phone call and I had a return authorization for the wrong part. They looked up the part I needed and ordered it for me. AND issued me a credit. RIDER'S NEEDS in Chicago [...] is an efficient, honest, and concerned seller that not only wants to make a sale; they want you as a REPEAT CUSTOMER.So in the end we both got what we needed. I got my front number plate and they got me as a CUSTOMER. The next time I need any bike parts it's straight to Rider's Needs!!!!!"

117390,1,"Have tried several different wipe-style cleaners and find that this Armor All product does as good a job of cleaning my GT's interior as any of the products tried -- and some of the other products cost a lot more!These make cleaning fast and easy and they seem to give the car that 'new car' clean fragrance. In just a few minutes the steering wheel, instrument panel, center console, door panel, back speaker deck, glove box and other plastic, chrome and vinyl interior component turn from dusty to sparkling clean. Using these wipes beats spraying on a cleaner and then trying to wipe it off with a cloth... I go through four or five wipes each time, so the canister should supply enough for five or six cleanings.The reason for four stars -- the quality control of the wipes' canister is just not good, as we have had brand new packages opened dry, others drying out within a short period of time, and then others staying nice and damp all the way until the last wipe was used. Since we like the wipes but no longer trust the canister, we dump the contents (wipes and fluid) into a large zip-loc bag for safekeeping. That works well, but we really should not have to do this... so, four stars instead of five.Other Armor All products that we really like are the tire foam (Armor All Tire Foam Protectant 20 oz (1 lb 4 oz) 567 g) which produces a rich looking satin finish, the leather wipes (ArmorAll Leather Wipes Canister, 20 Wipes - Cleans, Conditions and Protects) which are great on my GT's leather seats, and the protectant (Armor All 10228 Original Protectant - 28 oz.) is excellent on the dash and all interior and exterior rubber.Highly recommend this product if you have a similar need... but think about keeping them in a zip-loc bag or something with a good seal."

14317,1,I love my little pink Eton. I initially got it simply because this radio was on my wish list but I justify the purchase. When it went on Gold Box Special I was less than thrilled with the color on the screen but got it anyway.Sooo glad I did. Love the radio. Really love the color.
47121,0,"I like the quality of the tool, it was accurately described and appears to be capable of performing the advertised job. In my case, on a 2004 EVO, there is not enough room to fit the tool between the sprockets and the engine mount, so, I could not use it. Knowing the thickness of the tool and the available space is important know prior to purchase if you DIY. If you plan to work on a variety of cars, it should be a good purchase. I like the metal much better than the plastic alternatives."
65317,1,Just wish I had bought the coated rotors instead of the uncoated rotors. No rusty rotors to look at through the wheel. nothing for the wheel to rust too.... makes sense.
153415,1,"Bought rear rotors for my 2000 Dodge Intrepid, whose old rotors were junk from the cheapo pads that had been on it. I decided to get the good stuff and buy these and Wagner ThermoQuiet pads. Couldn't be happier. Quiet, dust free (important for me since I have pretty nice wheels), and it (unsurprisingly) stops better.What more could you want? Totally worth the money.Not really a con to the rotors, themselves, but amazon's photos are inaccurate. These aren't vented."

Good luck on that search. No parts/kits being made anymore.The only reason for the review is on some sites it states parts and kits availible...Heads up' they are not!Beware of buying any Shinnfuamerica jack.

93740,1,"I have had this about 8 months, use it to supply power to multiple battery chargers (charging Lipo batteries for RC planes) and I typically run it at the 20 amp limit. I like the dial showing the output in amps so I know when to stop adding more chargers on line. This device has performed really well, no complaints. If I were to do it again I would get a 30 amp charger so I could charge even more batteries at the same time. Because of losses in the chargers, I can charge about five batteries at 2.2 to 2.5 amps each."

At least they took it back...Maybe if the prospective buyer is an electrician and can pre-check with testing equipment this unit could be ok, but I have to call it my worst experience buying something from Amazon, bar none!

131606,0,"""Hi, I bought your 13244 Class III Trailer Hitch Receiver for my 2006 Jeep Liberty Sport on Amazon.comJust so you know - it cost me 9 dollars and something (almost 10 bucks) to go to the hardware store to buy the CORRECT BOLTS. The ones included in with your hitch are the WRONG ONES.You say on the instruction sheet that they are 12MM, but they were too big just barely.I went to the hardware store and bought (4) 10MM bolts and (4) 7/16 bolts - which fit. The welded nuts on the underside of a 2006 Jeep Liberty Sport are 7/16.The receiver, carton, and instructions all did have 13244 model number on it - and your hitch is fair once I got it installed. But, I was disappointed that your bolts/ hardware did not fit correctly and that I had take the time and money to go get the right bolts.""Therefore, I give this 4 out of 5 stars.Above was original review - I changed it to 3 stars after Curt's basic don't care response.Today I heard back from Curt - They offered NO compensation nor any real concernthat the enclosed hardware was incorrect. Just told me to check how tight the correct bolts were from time to time, because one of their hitches had come offand wrecked the guys boat ?The obvious safety instructions that come with the hitch and common sense would tell one to check the bolts from time to time for safety.I was disappointed at Curt's response and in the future would try either Reese or Valley hitches 1st."

I do wish the pocket the jack rests in was true to the size of the jack...too much space around the jack, and that the pocket was a little deeper. Other than those 2 issues, the extended base is a great accessory to have along for your jack."
38584,0,"A little Confusing But Overall a Good product for the price... It Did In a Sense Fix MY Crack /Chip.. But At alot of Angle you could still see the Chip and a Little crack When looking for it.But It is REally Good Because The CRack NEver Did Worsen after about 6 months of getting the crack and 2 Months after applying and Using this Fix Shield.Good Product, But Applicationa Directions a Little Tricky, If you dont know What your doing and Have little practice Which MOST of US BUYING THIS WILL HAVE NO EXPERIECE, It Is Probably Gonna Be a Little Tough and NOT Give you a PErfect Winsheild. If you want it PERFECT Gall Glassmasters or Sumthing. If you Want to PRevent Further Splitting, and Want it to look about 80% Better and Save Money THEN DEFINETLY BUY THIS!Depends What you are Expecting, Do Not EXPECT COMPLETING INVISIBLE REPAIR AREA, It will Not Happen with this Stuff unless you are SUPER SUPER good and Maybe Even trained at doing a couple with practice..but most of us buying this ARE NOT.Give it a Try Maybe..."
125665,1,excellent !!!is an excellent product arrived in excellent condition and is beautiful and high quality.the color is perfectthank you !!!!!
150957,1,"While I purchased this for just a noise and reliability factor I will state:I DID NOT BUY THIS FOR HP GAIN (feels the same, but car can breath better)I love K&N; filters, always will. This filter will last you a long time. There is some concern of MAF filter soiling (getting oil on the MAF) but as long as you keep the filter PROPERLY oiled and not OVEROILED you'll be good. I doubt I will ever have to replace this...Be aware that your filter may have some excess oil in the packaging and on the filter. I dried my filter off with a towel and took a hair dryer to it for about 10 minutes until all the excess oil was off. I took off one star for this."
159191,0,If you are looking for a scraper to get into the hard to reach places on things like a motorcycle or lawn mower this will fit the bill.
177688,1,"Very well made and a precise fit for the vehicle. Quick and easy to put up and take down. If you live in a hot and sunny climate, this is worth every penny. A huge improvement over the many cheap generic low quality sunshades out there."
120391,2,"I give this product one star because the box promises ""fast and easy installation"" yet it utterly fails to instuct me in how to put these on the car! (It's not intuitive and I'm no idiot, thank you very much)The installation instructions provided on the cardboard backing consist of a series of tiny drawings of a pair of hands holding various hard-to-identify objects performing various undescribed tasks that all look the same! What is the weird tool for? How does it work? What is happening in the pictures? What's the objective? Absurd!"
89112,1,very good quality...nice and thick not thin like some sold in the stores very good quality for the price. awesome
30576,0,"The filter fits fine. The oil filter cover seal, the odd shaped oring, does not. Its about 10% too small. I guess if you soaked it in oil and stretched it a bit, you may be able to get it in there... but I re-used my original, torques tot he right tightness, and watched for leaks."
28347,0,It may sound stupid right now.But I bought this to replace the original logo my wife lost after bumping in something.This logo we lost is right in the middle of the car between the hood and the bumper.It has nothing to do with this one.But it may be tricky when reading the package (with the official license from FORD)This name Domed implies that the logo is the 3D type like the one I lost etc...But it is not the case.This one is just a flat and small Ford sticker.
66748,1,I used this product to make a couple repairs to my personal watercraft and the material appears to be holding up quite well. No complaints yet.
53802,1,"This is your basic maintenance battery charger and is well worth the money. I would buy this one again, with out hesitation."
117644,2,"The product was just as described and, for the price you pay, the product does provide a nice beam of light. However, upon installation, you can follow all instructions about installing to a T and the plastic clips will still break. Despite my efforts to gingerly install the product knowing that others experienced the issue with the clips breaking, all but one clip broke on the headlights. I will be purchasing a better quality product to install in the near future. Spend a bit more and buy a better quality product, bottom line.."
92116,1,These are decent replacement wipers although the mounts are very cheap feeling as you clip them into place. If they hold up to ice and snow next winter I'll buy them again.
26205,1,"This merchant provided a great value. The service was prompt and accurate, unit is as described in add. the experience was without any difficulty , a one stop shop."
140693,1,Very nice code reader for the price. I carry it in the vehicle at all times just in cas.
176196,1,"I bought this to plug in my XM radio, Garmin Nuvi, radar detector, and air purifier. It's a cool little quad socket so you can plug in all of your accessories. It doesn't glow like I thought it would. Just has a little red light inside that lights up the clear, tinted shell a red color. Was hoping for a neon blue or something. Oh well. A good item for the price though. Was only like $5 when I bought it."
62246,0,Don't waste your time and money on cheap wheel bearings. I had to have my front wheel bearings replaced at the local auto shop which used cheap replacements. Both the bearings went bad in less than a year. I've bought 2 Timken's and so far which are working great. I just bought another one for the rear since the speed sensor went out. Excellent product.Follow up: The speed sensor just went bad on this item so now I have to replace the bearing again and I will be out another $85+. It lasted just over a year. I'm swithcing my 5 star to a 3 star review.
144625,1,It works. No leaks. Appears to be heavy duty and good quality... time will tell for sure. But I'm happy with the purchase and don't really expect to have any issues with it. The air control lever has a good feel to it... feels like quality.
54904,1,"The windshield arrived in a very timely manner. I have not installed it yet, but everything lines up perfectly, and it will look great on the bike when I finish remodeling it!"
36133,1,I am a service technician and our company purchased this for all of the tech's. They are used on a daily bases with no problems. Battery has a really long storage life also excellent run time. I also have the drill and the led light. The light will run over 24 hours on one charge and is brighter than the krypton bulb used by all the others. Hopefully they will start adding to the set with more tools soon.
35253,0,"I know K&N has a very good reputation and there cold air system did increase the hp greatly on my 99' F-150. But, there always seems to be a fit issue. For my truck their engineering documentation that was sent with the cold air kit did not completely jive with my truck. So, I had to add lib a bit at times. For my S4 the fit was less than perfect. It just didn't fit in the stock air box the same as the Mann brand filter that I had been using. But, I am looking forward to not having to buy anymore filters. They are very easy to clean."
42455,1,"I bought this thinking it would be useful in an emergency. Lo and behold, not once, but twice I forgot to turn off my headlights in the last two years, and this little unit (which I keep in the trunk) allowed me to jump start the car and be on my merry way.The second time was after it had sat in the trunk for over a year without any fresh recharging. Just those two times alone made the cost worth it for me. I know this unit won't last forever, but when it dies, I will buy another. It is great in an emergency!"
186478,1,MY wife and her friend both enjoyed. They are both addickets. It goes with the front plate and the mats.
22324,2,"I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!"
141664,2,"I moved from sunny, southern California to central Illinois. I have learned a lot about ""seasons"" and how to prepare for ""weather."" One thing I was told I needed to acquire was an ice scraper. No problem! One quick Amazon search later and I found one that had ""Fantastic"" IN THE NAME!Boom. Done.Some of my friends who grew up in snowy climates actually laughed when they looked at the scraper. OK, fine, maybe it's small, but that doesn't mean it's not mighty. Right?! Well, that may be true, but in this case... it's a joke. I imagine the people raving about this product don't deal with much more than a light frost. This ice scraper is pretty flimsy and not particularly effective. The blade actually BENT when I was trying to get ice off my windshield. The blade BENT. I don't think that's supposed to happen. I ended up throwing it away after that."
71961,0,"I've used this brush on 5 different occasions now, and not sure if it actually saves me much time over just using my lambs wool mitt. I'll admit its great for using on high places (truck's roof) but at ground level it seems difficult to use.I also agree with earlier comments, this brush captures a lot or soap and water when you pull it out of your bucket. I had to refill the 5 gallon bucket with soap and water twice to wash my Ford F-150. It normally only took one bucket with my wash mitt. Double the use of soap and water, in my opinion, negates the time saved using the brush."
187754,1,"So far so great. I still have all my tires/wheels, so no complaints from me. As this came w/five vs four, everything is secure."
33964,2,Bought this hoping it would at least last one winter. It only worked for about a month and then quit heating. Needless to say I am not a happy customer.
165341,0,"Haven't purchased this yet, still researching. This is not an EGR Valve. This is a canister purge solenoid, and according to AC Delco, it does fit a 2000 Chevrolet Lumina."
33253,1,"The product was as described and arrived in a timely way. Thankfully, I have not needed to use it."
10689,1,This item was purchased for my wife's Tahoe. It does a good job of keeping groceries from sliding around. One star deducted because of the high price.
25767,2,The site streetperformance.com links this kit to a 98 BMW M roadster. After taking out the transmission I found that it doesn't fit. Amazon should not allow this to happen.
45196,1,"This is an excellent, high-quality product at a fraction of the cost of the high end knobs. The fit and finish are top-notch and shipping was fast. You won't be disappointed in the improved shift feel that this provides."
12968,1,Filter fitted perfectly and had great packaging. Consider buying this one. Its worth it. International shipment and billing was ok.
21959,1,"My husband has his own auto repair business. We have looked at several different brands and spent quite a bit of time trying to decide on one. He really likes this tool because it is easy to use and with all of the adaptors that are included, it eliminates the need for trying to find ""the right tool"" for the job. He says that he would recommend this to anyone."
45586,1,"I packed away my emergency kit and various other might-need car items in this and I haven't heard anything from them since. It keeps everything nice and secure back there, which is all I asked it to do."
20841,2,"These ventshades looked good when I put them on. They did the job they were suppoed to do, but within a couple years some of the tape came off the plastic and they began flopping(eventually flying off as I drove down the road). After 3 & 1/2 years the plastic became brittle and is disintigrating on my car. The tape is still stuck where the shade was and looks like crap :( They work well for the short term, but if you are wanting them for a long term vehicle I would avoid these particular ones."
81670,0,"this grill arived broken, but with the cost of returning the product, i decided to just repair it, and use it the way it was. other than that it arrived quickly, and was a very good match to the original part."
57219,0,"I liked the color of this seat, But I needed a smooth surface seat cushion, this is a swede cloth. it didn't mention that in the description.I wanted some thing that wouldn't collect hair that would get on my clothes."
157553,1,This jacket is just way to awesome. I get compliments from all kinds of people on how nice it is. Top quality leather and it will never wear out. I can see having this jacket forever. I have wanted this jacket for 6 years (could never afford the $600.00 price) and i found out it was discontinued just a few months ago. So if you can find one i highly recommend you get one asap!! It is a little heavy though with the cold weather liner in and the protection Armour installed in the jacket.Cons: bugs splatter all over it and you have to clean it.
9518,2,"Only plus is that they look good.The fit is mediocre. There is no stretch areas so fitting them is a pain and there are still areas that are either too tight or too loose. Getting them on the back of my front seats required cutting out pieces of the factory seats.They aren't waterproof at all. They might as well be made of terrycloth, they absorb liquid that well.After 1 year, I have multiple tears, including the back seats which see VERY little use.Buy the Wet Okole"
43930,1,"Given this is a very basic code reader, I have used it on a Pontiac Sunfire, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and a Dodge Durango with total success. Thought that using it to get multiple codes is a little confusing. Resetting codes worked every time."
134872,0,Easy fitting with the brackets from my old Memphis fats screen. Less buffetting than the latter but more wind noise.
31528,0,"I bought this jacket for my husband along with the matching pants. It was difficult enough to find a set that wouldn't make him look like a Power Ranger so I settled on a black and grey combo, seemed to be the least flamboyant or clownish looking. The Pants seem to be fine and other than having to return for a smaller size (from large to medium, the legs were fine but once you got to the rear area it made him look like an inflatable lawn ornament) but the jacket was a huge disappointment. First time he put the jacket on the front zipper jumped the tracks and although we toyed with the idea of returning it we decided to keep it since we assume they installed shoddy made zippers into all of the jackets. He now has to pay special attention to how he zips it up, even if he is standing on the side of the road in the pouring rain. Now it DOES keep the rain out once you have it zipped up and as long as that zipper holds he should stay dry. Upon packing for a trip, he attempted to use the built in pocket for packing up the jacket. Well we were not surprised to find that the zipper for the built in storage pocket is equally if not even more shoddy and burst the on the first try. I am so disappointed! Tourmaster was at one time such a great company and you were able to find quality gear for a reasonable price. Now it has apparently 'outsourced', or made some other change to save money like so many others and, like everyone else the quality has suffered. I despair that we will ever again be able to find rain gear that works, we can afford, and doesn't make you look like a Power Ranger."
170955,0,"Great upgrade from factory halogen bulbs. Lots of beautiful ultra-white light. I just wish they lasted longer. Installed a set in my 2006 Mercedes CLK convertible. They provide so much more light than the factory halogen bulbs.But one burned out in 12 months, and we don't drive the car all that much. I wish they lasted longer. Makes driving at night easier and more enjoyable."
56222,1,"If you need great fitting and long lasting work gloves, these are the ones. I only wish they were waterproof but they do dry quickly. I use mine in everything from auto repair to home building. They lessen the impact felt from hammering and other such chores."
81800,1,I thought this worked great. I bought a car and it had 3 cigarette burn holes in it. 2 in the rug and one on the passenger seat. I think it looks great and it was easy to use. I almost wished there were more to repair because it was fun too.
80131,1,Good replacement for the original in our Honda engine Husqvarna Mower.Husqvarna 7021R 21-Inch 160cc Honda GCV160 3-In-1 RWD Self-Propelled Lawn Mower (CARB Compliant)Excellent quality and price.
24397,0,"These mirrors fit my truck perfectly, the only thing Im not thrilled with is the vibration I get in them when driving down the road. The vibration makes it hard to see in them while driving. They work fine for slow moving like backing up."
115691,0,"I am ok with the product, the price was (seemingly) fair.I ordered expecting 2 caps, like the photo shows. No mentionof it only being one cap.I ordered 2 ""orders"" and got 2 pieces in total.Whoever packed these goofed and sent one 5/8"" and one 3/4"".Ah well, ya win some, ya lose some.Easy Amazon returns are a blessing.Can buy at Napa in a 2 pack for 5 something plus tax."
149794,0,"I got this to remove adhesive that had melted onto the brick of my house. I sprayed it on, and the first thought was, ""Should I be wearing a respirator?"" This stuff has a strong chemically odor that is somewhat masked by a faint citrus smell. After intense scrubbing, the adhesive has not budged. It did seem to clean the brick...making this area slightly lighter than the rest of the house. Sigh...."
111303,1,"these are great wipers. they do exactly what wipers are suppose to do. they work !! no smudge, no squeak, no residual rain streaks, and my favorite,longer blades. these bad boys are so tight you almost wish it would rain."
166766,2,The product that came was not the product pictured. Had to return it twice.. Not Happy. The item was totally different from the one pictured on Amazon. This has never happened before.
108040,0,"Very easy install. (Jeep Liberty) Have had problems with the brake lights. i've checked and re-checked all connections including grounds, but the brake lights will occasionaly quit working. If I unplug the pigtail and plug it back in they will work. I suspect a flaw in the digital converter box."
12656,0,These came packed very nice. They looked great. They look OEM and fit OEM. The only issue is that after about a month the shine fads pretty bad and they get dull looking.
18373,1,"It drained out more oil from my car than pulling the drain plug underneath, I would definitely recommended to people doing their own oil change since it eliminates the hassle of getting underneath and made the oil change job a easy 30 min job. Built quality of this item is OK, not bad considering it's not that expansive, the price is pretty reasonable for what you receive."
138044,1,Well made and very easy too install just make sure you keep the tailgate closed when installing the side rails
167827,2,I heard that Fram has a smaller filter area inside and use paper as filter material.I am disappointed at this. will try other brand such as Mobile 1
136578,0,"This comes in two pieces and even with several attempts (mine and my husband's) at screwing this rod together, it still sags in the center. I had to put clothes on both ends and leave the middle empty to get it to work. My old rod had a metal tube that slid over the connection making it stronger and able to hold the weight of several items of clothing. This one does not have the extra grip, allowing it to sag in the middle."
87546,2,"Used it for Toyota RAV4, the filter was on pretty tight from the last dealer change? The quality didn't seem that great either."
93484,1,"These are by far the best looking of any aftermarket fender flares for the XJ Jeep Cherokee.They do require that you trim some metal away from the wheel well opening. This requires some finesse that is best achieved using a metal cutting blade on a Dremel tool. Though it is slower that power shears or a larger 4-5"" cut-off blade, it allows for precise trimming. It also does not bend or crimp the sheet metal like the shears do.The installation goes best when the wheels are off of the vehicle, as it allows you to work with additional space behind the fender panel. In order to use the factory fender well liner, you'll have to do some trimming and create some holes for the retainer snaps.These will work on the newer year XJ Cherokees, but you'll have to remove or modify the rear bumper end caps (trim pieces). This wasn't an issue with me, as I already have an aftermarket bumper and removed those a long time ago.The rear wheel wells require that you trim VERY CAREFULLY, so as to not cut through some spotwelds that are precariously close to the trailing edge of the rear passenger's door. This is a job best left to someone who is skilled at this kind of work - mess up here and you are in trouble.DURABILITY:Use ""Back to Black"" regularly and these will maintain their ""like new"" appearance for ages.Bushwacker changed the formulation of the plastic on these a few years ago, so that they are a lot more flexible. The earlier generations were so stiff that they'd crack from the slightest impact.BUSHWACKER STILL WILL NOT WARRANTY THESE AGAINST BREAKAGE DUE TO AN IMPACT OR COLLISION.They are a lot better that the earlier generation of fender flares."
1911,0,"It does what it meds to do, but it's a pain to get it on and off. but once you got it on, it seems to work. I'm waiting for the blizzard before I judge it...."
49701,1,"I purchased this Jeep Grand Cherokee upper radiator hose to a 2004 vehicle with 4.7 motor.The original needed replacement as it was bubbling out, ready for failure. I installed thepurchased hose immedietely, size just right, lenght just right, clamps fitted perfectly well.Good, well manufactured quality item."
1339,0,"I purchased this based on the description and the sketch both here and on the Stant page. It physically works as described but does not have the OEM style ridges around the perimeter. As such, it can't be used as an identical replacement part where appearance matters most. That said, it will function and has a beautiful mirror finish that is much better than my original which needs to be re-chromed."
86532,0,"Had higher expectations for this product for use in my 2007 Ford F150.I specified my model, make, and year and had hoped the carpet would be better color matched. Seems to be a generic beige color which somewhat matched my carpet but you can clearly tell it is a not color matched.Also, the pictures don't show the extra holes that are in the mat to use what the call a ""snap fastener system"" to stop the carpets from sliding. Essentially it appears to be a wide, nylon screw which is supposed to crew into your truck's carpet and then protrude thru the mat via one of the holes. Once thru you put a little plastic cap over it. There is no way the nylon scew was going to make it into my carpet. I don't care to have the plastic caps on top of the carpet.Overall - disappointed. If I would have seen these mats in person I would not have purchased them. They'll do but I should have shopped more carefully."
33459,0,"Since the whole concept of siphoning is based on suction, I would have imagined a siphon hose to be able to withstand negative pressure. Unfortunately however, while attempting to siphon anything, the soft plastic tube just collapsed into a rather flat ribbon, severely restricting the rate of flow. It was also almost impossible to keep the tube from kinking even over mild bends.Having said that though, the shaker pump itself works like a charm and that was the primary reason for my buying this item. After removing the tube and attaching a section of much more sturdy rubber hose I bought elsewhere, this siphon works brilliantly. Only a few shakes on the rubber hose, and I've got a nice unrestricted flow going.I tested it in the kitchen sink and the pump and rubber hose combination was able to drain the water into a bucket faster than I could refill the sink with taps running at full blast."
3828,0,"I really wanted sun shades for my car. This was nice, but expensive. I found a twin pack made by the First Years for about a buck more at another store.They do a decent job, especially if you have a smaller car. I have a mid-size sedan and they just aren't wide enough for the rear door windows."
178596,1,I purchased this one as a replacement for one I had broken. We use these when we pull our camper. They are extremely useful and really easy to get on and off the truck. Just right for what we needed them for!
183348,1,i can feel the gas saving and the engine sounds smooth also a very good atfermarket parts easy to install
188041,1,I replaced the plastic vent cap on my camper with this metal cap. I have broken two plastic caps when going under branches. So far this metal cap is holding up well.
134831,1,"Great product, I changed fluid and added the modifier and gear oil after 60,000 miles and truly did not expect to feel a differance, but I most certaily do feel the smoothness on every level. I would use it on my other trucks."
129570,2,"I had a Yakima rack for years and it was fine. Did what a rack should do. The high price maybe was worth it, maybe not but that's up to you. The problem with this expensive system was made clear to me one day when I came out to my car and the rack was gone. Yes, I bought the expensive locks and it was locked. How could it possibly have disappeared? Turns out these clips aren't really designed to stay on so seriously. Apparently you can just jam a screw driver under the clips and pry them out from the door recess. You're thinking, but won't that scratch up the car quite badly? Yes. Yes it does. Beware this system. It's not as secure as Yakima wants you to believe. I'm just glad there was no expensive bike on it when it left. Getting better mileage now and I don't have to worry about parking garages!"
156765,2,"I wanted a good set of replacement wipers. Typically my strategy is to find a product that has a lot of great reviews. The more 5 star reviews a product has the more comfortable I feel buying. These Evolution blades were no exception.I was really excited to get the new blades, as my old ones were horrible and just smeared everything across the windshield. Unfortunately my excitement was short lived; the blades come pre-bowed, which is supposed to cause them to hug the windshield tighter. From the day I bought these wiper blades the passenger side blade only clears the lower half of the blade and the very tip of the top of the blade- so basically you can't see anything if you are sitting in the passenger seat. I have tried numerous adjustments to try to get this wiper to lay flat on the windshield, with no success.Initially this was more of an annoyance- since I rarely ever have a passenger in my car and the driver side was working great I just put up with it. However now the driver side wiper is starting to smear on about the top 1/3 of the blade. Have had the blades 2 1/2yrs, which for premium wipers I don't think should be considered a long time."
127418,0,"This thing works fast. Way easier than the old tire gauges I've been using all my life. The rubber handle is pretty nice. It's also lightweight.On the con side, it could have been made a bit smaller. It's a little awkward, and although it works well for cars, it does not for bicycles as I have to weave it into the spokes just so. Even then, it's difficult to keep it from releasing a lot of air from the tire in an attempt to get a reading."
153929,0,"Shurlatch was the style of cabinet fastener that was in our cab over camper. This style of fastener is hard to find but I found it on Amazon. The color matched perfectly. We are in Arizona and since the Shurlatch is mainly made of plastic, they will dry rot more quickly. Order extras in case you need them later. Item was easy to install, even for a girl! Latches the cabinet closed very well so that the cabinet doors do not open while you are in motion. Only drawback to the item is the plastic issue."
39692,1,So far I am happy with my truck cover. First off it took only three minutes to put on and it also fits prefectly. I am looking forward to checking how it withstands the weather during the upcoming winter.
129895,1,I love this thing. No more oil down my arm and elbow when I pull the drain plug. No more new drain plug washers. It takes a little time to suck the oil out but it does a complete job.
31509,0,"The sticker looks awesome, but it is hard to install you must be careful. And after installation it is easily peeled off from friction. I would recommend spraying a clear coat over to prevent this."
42585,0,"I have had these for a while and the first opportunity to use them just came up. In extremely cold weather, a friend left the lights on on his BMW 325Ci and needed a jump. I pulled up alongside, got out my never used safety boost cables, bragging about how safe they are, hooked him up to my running car, checked for the status lights (both on) and...nothing. His engine would not even turn a bit. We tried hooking up directly to his and my battery terminals. Still nothing. Another friend was present and he brought over some conventional (and non-safety) booster cables. We hooked up and tried to fire the BMW up. There was a sign of life, the engine slowly turned. So I gunned the engine on my car, we waited a couple of minutes, and the Beemer started.I think that the circuitry in the safety boost cables may not allow use with a REALLY DEAD battery. A limitation. I now carry both the safety boost cables and my old heavy copper cables. A pity that I cannot trust these fancy new ones."
183438,2,"After reading a positive review of this product, I decided to try it, but I found that low temperatures are the Achilles heel of this product.Let me explain my experience with this product and you will better understand its limitations. I bought this product to fill a several dozen cavities about 2""x2""x3"" to seal against possible water damage. The same day I bought it I applied it and after 48 hours it still had not hardened. I was careful to shake the can for one minute before using and apply the foam with the can in an upright position, yet the result was still the consistency of shaving foam two days later. One puff from your mouth and it would scatter in all directions even after waiting two days. If you put your finger in it to try to ""machine"" it the bubbles would pop like dish suds and it would be reduced to the consistency of cold oatmeal.I called the company using the toll-free number on the can and read them the first six digits of the batch number 510099 and they said there it had been made on the 99th day of 2010, eight months earlier, and that there were no known bad product batches on that day. When I described the behavior of the product they confided that the this would happen if the product were stored or transported at 32 degrees causing it to freeze and to go bad.I brought the can back to the store and explained what I learned to the manager. She directed me to place in the store with the freshest cans. The batch number on those cans started with 510280-a fresher batch made in September instead of April. I did an exchange at the customer service desk and this time I was smart enough to create a little three inch mound on a brick before trying to use the product. It was still the same consistency a day later as it was when it came out of the can.Now I happen to live in Los Angeles county and it doesn't usually get very cold, BUT about thirty days earlier there was a cold snap at might that left ice on windshields the next morning. So my surmise is that every can of this product in every unheated store in this area died on the shelf that night-just an educated guess.Forewarned is forearmed, I was able to clean up the mess with a can of compressed air--you might not be so lucky.By the way, though this product did not harden standalone, it seems to have a great affinity for clothing and will dry quickly and permanently stain, so if you get any on your cloths, clean it up as quickly as possible with a stiff scrub brush.Prices are much lower in home improvement store chains."

105584,0,"The materials and fit are BMW caliber. But, the color match in reality against what is posted on the product page is way off. From the pictures on the webpage you are thinking beige/tan.... product is actually more of a medium brown and a far cry from anything beige. Not wanting to deal with the hassle of returning the item, I will just deal with the color. Other than that, good product."
154927,0,"The hitch is, well a hitch. There were, however, significant installation problems on a 2003 Odyssey that cause me to downgrade the product. Having read other reviews, I knew I would need to spend significant time cleaning out the bolt holes before trying to install. I thus took a wire brush, WD40 and a lot of elbow grease to each hole before I even tried to fit the bolts.Even having done so, the bolts were quite difficult to get started, and then, once started, the threads within the nuts were actually were re-cutting and deforming the threads on the bolts. I spent days working on this process. It seemed that the thread specs were off just enough to make the installation impossible.I read another review of the hitch, and another reviewer said that he had to re-tap the holes to get it to work. I ordered a 12mm x 1.25 High Speed Steel Plug Tap (costs less than a few gallons of gas) from Amazon.com, and that worked like a champ. Right after using the tap (which itself was not hard), the bolts went in very easily and installation took less than another half an hour. The bolt holes did not line up easily, though and it was a two man job (one had to force movement into the hitch to align the holes & the other had to screw in the bolts).If it were clear in the instructions that you needed to re-tap the holes and alignment of the hitch were easier, I'd give it a better review. As it is, the poor instructions and installation problems seem to make it much less good than it could be (and really unacceptable to me. If you're going to have to re-tap, the requirement needs to be large and up front in the product description).If you have time, you could avoid buying the tap up front, try it & see if it works, but if you have problems, you might neet to get a tap. The size tap you need would depend on your vehicle.As a final thought, a tap is not an ideal solution, though, because I am told folks think that it can undermine integrity of the fit."

Once installed, product seems to work as advertised.Cons: Routing air lines was more difficult than anticipated. Would likely be easy on truck with I-beam frame members. My Toyota Sienna has nothing but smooth surfaces underneath, so difficult to find a place to route airlines. Also, had issues sliding air lines over nipples on air shocks without damaging airlines and causing them to leak (hint, use soapy water).Good product once installed."

188049,2,"I'm picky when it comes to spending my money and so I don't buy products made in China if I can help it. Not when there is an American made option.For the price of this item, you can get an American made Warn receiver shackle.If being made in China doesn't matter to you then you can still save money by buying this very same Chinese made receiver shackle under another brand name."
184244,0,"This laser thermometer was recommended to me and I ordered it expecting a high quality item. However the price should have told me it was cheap, and when I received it its light and plastic with a display that could be alot better.The buttons are small and the laser doesn't automatically come on, you have to select to turn the laser on every use. The thing I dislike about it the most may be if you don't use it for like 15secs then it shuts off, and you have to turn it on and press the laser button again....Overall I complain to much because in the end I find I use it alot on many different things...from my wood stove to my truck engine, and bottom line is that it works great! It seems to be very accurate as long as you aren't over 10' away and I would recommend it to anyone, just keep in mind I have a feeling if you drop it once its game over. One last note, it has a greater range of temp than any other I found in the same price range!"

I highly recommend this as a cheap and easy bolt on item for your truck or SUV!"
151510,1,"I bought this for my 2006 Chevy Trailblazer. The smaller one is just a few inches too short - as it gets used it will eventually slide out from under the sunvisors.But the jumbo one is just the right height. Except it's too wide. But that's okay - I just don't fold out the last segment on each side. Then it fits quite nicely.So if you have a GMT360/370 SUV (TB, Envoy, Saab 9-7, Isuzu something, Buick Rainer, Olds Bravada) - this is probably the better size to purchase.Sizing aside - the shade itself works well (south Florida sun really makes these a necessity), holds up well enough, stores reasonably well, and can be put up and taken down from the windshield fairly quickly."
143672,0,"had been using so many light bulbs and this one is the brightest one (more far, more wide, and more bright). It evens wider and far than piaa intense white but it is so easy to burn out. the first pair burn out after 6 months (no DRL running). the second pair i think also gone less than a year. If you don't care the trouble to keep replacing it and $37 dollars less than a year, it is the bulb you need because even tho GE, piaa won't more wide and this long distance."

181651,0,"I bought 6 quarts of this for my 2005 Chevy Tahoe 5.3 liter V8 (56K miles) after reading all of the high reviews and buying into all of the hype, but after trying it out for about 1K miles, I'm not impressed.Don't get me wrong, this oil does exactly what it is supposed to do; lubricates, cleans, and protects the engine. But as far as delivering more horsepower; higher-torque; and a cooler running engine, I saw absolutely no difference over the CONVENTIONAL oil I had just switched from. Running conventional oil, my Tahoe saw 15.8 MPG, and an internal engine temperature consistently between 201-205 degrees F. The temp and MPG after 1K miles of running Royal Purple? 15.7 MPG and 201-205 degrees F. I have also noticed no difference in engine sound or torque as many others have mentioned in reviews.I honestly believe that many people experience dramatic results with Royal Purple only because they also change out their coolant, differential oils, transmission oil, and air filters at the same time.Bottom line is that I ran 6 quarts of 5W30 RP with a brand new K&N; filter for 1K miles after switching from 50K miles of conventional oil, and saw absolutely no difference.Save your money. I will be switching to Mobil 1 next oil change due to their lower cost and solid reputation. I tried the ""boutique"" oil. Never again."
395,2,These are not HID. One star for false advertising. Persons unfamiliar with headlight technology are confused my this type of misinformation. It is typical for non-HID lamps to advertise that they have Xenon gas and that is confusing enough (although technically true). But to call these lights HID is just plain inaccurate and misleading.

162810,0,Item came in on time and looked fine. Installed on a 3-series BMW with new rotors. Brake dust is much less now and performance s fine but its giving off a strange grinding noise almost similar to as if you have a worn out pad with its metal to rotor grinding scenario.

When I had ordered the items the computer was showing 2 left in stock, and when I had purchased the items, the shipping confirmation had stated that it would take 2 months to ship them to me. After waiting two and a half months I still had not received the items, so I e-mail the seller. I ended up canceling my first order. Then about six months later I still wanted the items, so I tired ordering them again. This time the order went through and they shipped the items. The shipping was kind of slow and when I opened the package the appearance of the items did not look like the picture."

67252,1,"I had to replace this part on my 05 gmc ext cab truck due to the relay malfunction (the pin for the high setting on my a/c melted and was hard to disconnect). Once I was able to disconnect this and butt splice the new connector leads along with this part from amazon I regained my full a/c control. The product worked fine and was what I needed. Amazon had the best price on the blower motor resistor pack. Ebay had the best price on the connector.Tip: Before you splice the wiring, leave the connector in tact and cut the wires just past the connector so that you can see the correct color alignment. When plugging back in to the blower motor resistor pack with the connector use some dielectric grease."
178975,1,"Again, I am actually quite impressed and love the tackiness of the ""Lucky 13"" merchandising, it's priceless! At this point I probably have a little bit of everything they make. Thus far, my two favorite things from Lucky 13 merchandising have been these mats and a ""Chino jacket"", that has ""Lucky 13"", ""tattoo your soul"", beautifully stitched to the back of the jacket, with a small skull in a top hat on the front chest.Oh, back to these mats ... I have managed to acquire several at this point, and use them. Especially, when handling camera gear, and other items that do not do well with shock or hard surfaces. The mats are actually black and red, not identical to the picture on Amazon. They are a good meaty size, thick, medium to soft rubber, with nice channels to catch small parts, screws, springs, etc. with minimal ""bounce factor"". Despite being primarily rubber, they also leave no marks or any other traces of their existence behind, and are furniture friendly. I'd buy a few more, but I think my wife would kill me!!! Seriously, for the price, it wouldn't matter what the theme is, you are getting far more than you are actually paying for. My humble opinion."

The pure 1 is an excellent choice if you want a ""better"" filter from the standard, especially if you are planning on using synthetic oil and running your oil past 5,000 miles. It has a neoprene gasket, and it makes it easier to get off after many miles. I love these filters and stock quite a few for the different cars i service. And getting them from Amazon is fast, easy, and cheaper. How can you go wrong. The quality of the parts is far superior to the competition."
83715,1,"At first I thought this was a gimmick product, but when mounted on the side and the back of our RV it gives me a simple way of knowing if my RV is relatively level. They are small and unobtrusive (that's nice), but fairly accurate. Both levels come with a sticky pad that's about half the size of the unit, so no screws are needed. I'm not sure how well the sticky pads will hold up over time in the weather, but I'll update this review if needed. I wish the sticky pads were larger, but I could always get larger pads if it becomes an issue in the future. It's best to mount these little buggers when your RV is already level. It's probably best to mount one directly over the wheel(s) of your trailer, but not necessary. Overall, I am very happy with these little levels."

First, when it works, it is a thing of beauty, allowing the gate to close gently just like it states.Unfortunately, it does not work all the time, it is very difficult to install and mine only lasted 18 months before it stopped working. When I took it off the fence I could see the tremendous amount of rust throughout. I would not buy this again as I certainly did not wish to spend this amount of money on such a limited time frame."

10982,1,I have purchased K&N products before and I will never buy a normal air filter again. They are a quick installation that really makes a difference in performance and never needs replacing. Be sure to clean the filter and oil the filter per specs for the best performance. I bought this filter for my 2006 RX 400h and it fits perfectly. Double check that the filter is in the correct orientation. I noticed two extra rubber parts on the filter that lined up with my air chamber. I wish that there was a simple instruction saying which side goes where and what goes up. After looking over the filter and air compartment it was simple to figure out.

This kit already includes the bracket with it. I too won't be returning the >$5 bracket since shipping alone will be about that much, but that is not Hoppy's fault. This is a slam dunk for trailer hookup. No more need to carry the 7 pole to 4 flat adapter (greasy item rolling around in glove box). The holes in the included mounting bracket matched up perfectly to the pre-drilled holes in the Reese hitch I purchased at the same time. This along with the Hopkins/Hoppy t-connector trailer wiring kit just reached to allow me to make all of my connections without any extra splicing. Pack the 4-flat connectors with contact grease and zip-tie the two connectors together. Wiring doesn't get any easier."

185861,0,"I got one of these for the 2007-08 Honda Fit. The box says that is what I got, but the fit on the dash is pretty bad. It is clearly slightly too wide and can't ever be smoothed out all the way because of this. The reason I got it was to keep the car a bit cooler and reduce reflections, and it does that fine, but it is far from perfect. I give it a grudging 3 stars, as there is really no excuse for it to fit so poorly given that it supposedly matches my exact car model and year.P.S. I inherited one of these from the same company with a purchase of a 2001 Honda Insight (the real Insight, not the new huge one) and it fit excellently and was of a better quality. That one was from the original owner, and it is now about 10 years old and is still in great condition."

66463,1,Absolutely perfect experiance. Great quality product that is well packaged and has all required directions in package. Love it love it!
28297,1,This pad is fairly soft. It's made of neoprene so if you're like me and needed some soft padding on your shoulder (because you just had shoulder surgery)this may not be the pad for you.
39719,2,"I just re-read the description, and the above seat cover description is a gross misrepresentation. It incorrectly, if not fraudulently indicates that the covers were customized to fit my specific model. The covers are a sloppy fit, especially on the passenger side, and the controls that are not completely covered are available only through wide sloppy generic openings obviously made to account for any number of general configurations."
177462,0,This is a good helmet. Good price and everyting as promised. I bought it as a backup to put in my bags. The negatives are it sits really high on your head due to the inside padding and the vinyl straps make your face sweat.
134889,2,"This product looks like the one it replaced, but was too big for the motor housing. I tossed the worn out gear so I could not make a comparison, but this gear was at least 2mm too big to fit in the housing for the window motor on my 1991 Ford Tempo. In additon, the package itself states 62 teeth on the gear, but the Amazon website says 52. Be sure to measure your gear and compare it to the measurements on this website first before ordering.1/28 Update. Found out that even though product was stated on Amazon's website as fitting my 1991 Ford Tempo, but did not fit, and that I was the one who had to find a box to ship it back in, and to pay postage to do so of around 3 bucks. Frustrating. The product was sent to me in a bubble wrapped manila envelope (which caused the plastic packaging inside to be smashed, but not the part.), but I had to ship it back in a box. Again, frustrating, but I buy things from Amazon, so I already had a small box to do so. Now I am just waiting for a credit."
187365,1,"Used this to flush the black tank after it started to give false readings on the gauges. I now use it several times a year when draining the black tank. Much easier than putting a wand down the toilet or using some other rinsing method. You don't want to have your tanks go bad, way too much to repair. In my opinion, this is a MUST have for RVers!"
12166,1,"I ordered this product after doing a lot of research. I usually spend a month overseas every year and always find my car battery dead on my return.Before leaving for an overseas trip this June, I plugged this charger to the batteries. The red light indicates the batteries are charging and the green light indicates they are charged. When i came back after a month, my van started without any problem. This was a great buy."
126941,0,"This product did not work for me as expected. I wanted to use it to charge a dead car battery and liked the automatic features of it (basically stop charging after fully-charged). Unfortunately, the Overload light would come on after a minute or so and the automatic features would stop the charging. After contacting Schumacher customer service, they informed me that this product is more of a battery maintainer rather than a battery charger. For a 12V car battery, it requires at least 10V to avoid the Overload response - this was documented nowhere, not even the user's info. Thank you to Amazon for their easy return process! I went back and purchased the cheaper Shumacher 1AMP 12V manual battery charger and also a voltmeter - it worked like a charm!!"

124827,0,"The product generally works as advertised but.... If you do not dry the car after the special filtered rinse, you will still get some water spotting. Granted that is less than if you just hosed it off, but still some spotting. I would recommend that for best results, you let the car stand for 5 minutes after the final filtered rinse and them look for residual water on the surface and dry it off with either a chamois or microfiber cloth."
181897,0,"My straps broke just like everyone else but it didn't matter... still worth the money. I don't get a wet shirt anymore. My only criticism is how stiff this product is. It feels like corrugated plastic with a thin layer of mesh cloth on it. I'm sure the more expensive or water-cooled versions are softer or conform to your seat better but like I said, this is worth the lower cost."
135577,1,"Worth to purchase it. I'm a student prime member for 6 months. I ordered this mat in Jan 24th, and received it next day. The shipping is extremely fast and mat is really good. It fits my honda accord well. Besides, 4 pieces mats for only 14 bucks is a great deal."
134721,1,"It seems to be working fine in my NV4500 transmission, no problems so far.

164054,0,The inverter does exactly what it promised to do but it is very loud. I kept thinking my car window was open and I was hearing road noise.
32496,1,Easy to install. It works perfect on my Lexus SUV. it keeps out the rain and wind the company shipped fast. I liked it so much i ordered the one for my moonroof!
19564,1,Love this stuff! It is by far the best glass cleaner I have ever used for my car windows-the only one that doesn't leave awful streaks. I do prefer the aerosol to the pump container but that is just me. Can't go wrong.
167096,0,"The installation was rather easy, I had to plug one of the O2 sensor bungs. I don't like the slip-fit style exhaust piping. I rather have the flange/bolted style. This one uses cheap exhaust clamps. But what do you expect for $190?The tone is a bit loud, especially when starting the car, it has a loud rumble. My I30 is dropped on KSport lowering springs. Whenever I go over a bump, the rear part of the exhaust hits the rear suspension and makes a clunk sound. It is extremely irritating."
82181,1,"All right, Adjust well on the bike, however I think the original has a best presentation and even better fit, I should clarify that there is nothing wrong with this device and it is too early to assess its performance, is currently installed and working well in general I have no complaints."
40795,0,"These mats fit pretty well. they are more expensive than generic mat sold at Target, but these may fit better. However some of the Universal Mats from Target look more deluxe. these mats look nice but seem a little basic and thin. also the back seat floor mats are shorter than the stock mats. the stock mats go quite a bit further under the front seats.I wish I had tried the universal mats from Target first and see how they fit. oh, well, no that I have 'em we'll see how they hold up.We have the pearl white TL with the light tan interior. the stock carpets are light tan too and get dirty too easy. there is some black on the upper door panel and dash, so these black floor mats work as it continues the two tone look to the floor."
33335,0,"No problem with the quality or order delivery, but beware you will need to buy one for each caliper piston. For my SVT Mustang that means 2 per caliper, 4 total for the front brakes.

141004,0,Not the quality that I would expect for the amount of money I spent. Seemed to be thinner material and not as dark as I expected.
157696,0,This coupler set is very good quality and seems to be a very strong lock set. But the barbell type coupler does not fit on my travel trailer coupler. I like the fact that it came with 4 like keys as other sets i have looked at only had 2 keys. I almost kept it just for the receiver lock just for the fact it had 4 keys but decided to return it because the reason of buying a kit is to be keyed alike. If you decide to purchase this set just be sure the hole in the coupler on your trailer is well above the ball plate. This was the problem I had with the barbell type lock would not close as it was hitting the sides of the ball plate.
34247,1,I purchased this a few months ago and I finally got to use it over the weekend. We go on many camping trips and my Explorer does not have enough room for all the equipment and five people so I needed more room. I am tired of havign other people take my stuff up in there cars. I own all the equipment and everyone just camps with us. After loading my car and the bag we headed to Bass Lake. We drove for over four hours and when we arrived the bag was still in place and never moved. It also did not make any noise. We left it on top of the car the entire time and it made it through yosemite twice as well as the long drive home. So in four days it lasted 16 hours on top of the car in the heat. No rips or tears or any detaching. I say it is well built!!! Cant wait to use it again
99761,1,"Great value for the money. No need for fancy expensive wires. Paired with NGK Iridiums, I get more power, engine runs smoother and uses less gas."
18730,2,"Unless you are an electrical engineer, do not purchase this with the intent to self-install it in a Chrysler product with a one-wire lock/unlock system. After about a week and half of trying to install it myself (with 2 calls to Audiovox's technical support people), I finally had to take it to a professional. To make it work, the professional had to add another part (at a cost of $57.00). The final insult is that to make the system unlock all doors you have to (1) press the unlock button, (2) wait until the driver's door unlocks, and (3) exactly 3 seconds after the driver's door unlocks, press the unlock button a second time. Failure to follow this procedure exactly results in extreme frustration (but not unlocked doors)."

156873,0,"I've had Bosch window wipers for a long time always using the top-of-the line ICON. I decided to try this one and it was all fine in the summer and fall. But as soon as the temp dropped below 20 degrees, the lower half of the blade completely lost contact with the windshield. I checked for ice buildup and nothing. So the only thing can be in the cold weather, the rubber turns to stone. Live in a cold climate, get the icons. These are disappointing."
166554,1,"Many reviews were from buyers with Mercedes. Bought this for new GL450 (high beam) expecting it to match aftermarket HID (4300k). [GLs with factory HID are bi-xenon; so they do not have to worry abouth the high-beam] Halogen naturally has a yellowish light and the blue tint changes the color more white. Surprisingly the color of the beam was very white, somewhere close to 5000K. Ignore the review that said it was yellowish, they are wrong. The brightness is about the same as stock since these are a higher wattage; compensating for the loss of brightness from the tint.Another reviewer stated that is looked like a childs toy blue...now I know what they mean. The GL high beam is a clear reflector (not projector lens). If you stare into the lens (lights off), there is a strong blue color. From a distance it is a light blue color. At first this seemed annoying; but now I actually like it. Should not be noticeable in a projector lens or a lens with a cut-off.I was thinking about returning the item...but I think its a keeper. There is NO other bulb that comes close to matching the an HID color. Have tried PIAA Xtreme (4100k) and Sylvania Ultra (4100k); each was very yellow compared to the HID."
35126,0,"After reading many reviews and researching online I decided to try Herculiner for an unorthodox use ,it just seemed like it was going to work fine ; I used it to create a protective coat on the bottom of my Emotion Glide kayak , since it was taking a lot of abuse launching of concrete boat ramps and from rocks and logs when I stopped at the river banks , it got several deep scratches and adding this super though liner to it sounded like a good idea , but ...Nothing sticks to Polyethylene , no glue or Coating , this plastic is very though to work with , the Herculiner looked very nice , but it just peeled off any time it came in contact with anything rough in big chunks , I know it was not supposed to be used in this kind of application but a disappointment none the less .Later on I found out , quite by accident , that rubberized undercoating for cars works great on Poly , and is very resistant to abrasion so this worked great on my kayak , success finally !!"

7982,2,"I purchased these mats as winter replacment mats for my Cadillac. I wanted to keep the original mats with the Cadillac Crests from getting damaged during the winter months. Salt mud snow etc. The quality of these ""premium"" mats is good but nowhere near the factory mats cushion and feel as described on the site. Also the color matching left something to be desired. Mine were at least 4 shades darker than the factory ones that match the carpet exactly (as you would expect from the factory). The fit however is good almost a perfect match to the originals. Bottom line, I could have paid half the price for the same quality mats at any auto parts store."

160599,1,"Easy install ! Had 12&#34; of snow the day after christmas, so I got to put these to the test, they locked in and out very well. the only draw back is they set recessed in the hub cap about an inch in my 2002 F250. not a problem just dosn't look as good as it would if it wasflush."
65228,0,"After reading the reviews for this product I was under the impression that it was easy to program from the directions included in the package. Now I don't know if it because of the model of my car or some other factor, but it was in no way easy to program. Matter of fact the ""included directions"" just directed me to a site that had me look up my car's make and model which then explained a complicated (at least for me) method to program the remote. So not wanting to screw up my new remote or car I just took it to the dealership and had them program it. Once again I don't know if it was due to the remote or the mechanic's fault but they were only able to program the first two buttons, the lock and unlock, which is fine except the I really wanted it to be able to open my trunk as well. So just a word of caution, be careful if buying this product."
11265,1,I installed this seat on my 2007 kawasaki vulcan 900 custom and holy crap what a world of difference. I was able to go on a 400 mile ride so much easier with this new seat. Worth its weight in gold.
93552,1,"I really can not say anything good about the Haynes manual, it covered way too many models and didn't do any of them well. The Chilton 1994-1998 Manual is far more precise, the pictures are much, much, better, the Exploded View drawings (missing from the Haynes manual) are great. Also those exploded view drawings are so crisp and clear, the smaller ones can even be magnified on a Copier with excellent results.I regret I didn't find the Chilton's manual before buying the Haynes version."

34023,0,"There is very little ""Deluxe"" about the Wagan IN2282 Deluxe Heated Seat Cushion.It accomplishes it's intended function: it heats your back and backside, but there is much room for improvement with this product.The faux-leather has a cheap feel to it. The thin elastic straps have flimsy plastic hooks which are supposed to anchor the seat cover in place...it doesn't. The hooks are ineffective and placement of the straps were inconvenient for a Nissan Xterra without additional modification. The seat cushion tends to slide off the seat when entering or exiting the car, inconvenient.The seat heats up relatively quickly, but there is no control to adjust the temperature other than unplugging the seat cushion when it gets too hot.If you don't want to shell out the money for a real heated seat, this is a cheap (and inexpensive) alternative, remember however, you do get what you pay for."
180364,1,"Just Made the trip to Arizona from Ohio in our 2010 f 150 towing our 28"" travel trailer, these mirrors was a God sent!!! they look great on the truck to boot. Thanks to the other reviews Thats why i bought the mirrors."
173176,2,"This hitch is difficult to install. It is VERY heavy! I've installed probably 8 or 10 hitches in my lifetime, this was one of the most difficult installations. The fit on my 2006 Saturn ION was not good. The ""kick-up"" receiver hit the bumper requiring a moderate rework to even permit completion of installation. It's bottom component is extremely visible from the rear. To be fair, I'd have to say the design of my Saturn isn't ""hitch friendly"". This would also most likely be so for its sister, a Chevrolet Cobalt ,or a Chevrolet HHR. I guess Curt gave it their best shot. This hitch does not, like some others, bolt to the (alloy) bumper reinforcement. To it's credit, it bolts solely to the frame. (As such ""frame"" exists- not much).The ball is too close to the bumper. It's installed, I'll use it. (see addenda, can't use) I now wonder if I need to reassess other (brands of) hitches that bolt to the bumper reinforcement and weigh less than half (of the Curt)..The instruction sheet gives times of 30 minutes to a `professional' and 1 hour to a DYI owner. I'm an accomplished mechanic and it took me over 2 hours, including the modifying time to TRY to make it fit.Addenda 2-6-11: Hitch totally unuseable as ball is nearly against the rear bumper. (disregard previous ""I'll use it"" it ain't gunna' happen, Holmes) Draw bar profile totally WRONG! ADDITIONAL (at this time unknown how) modification necessary to secure clearance from rear bumper. Movement of hitch rearward IMPOSSIBLE! Back to the drawing board. VERY POOR DESIGN, I WISH CURT HAD THIS OVERLY HEAVY, ILL FITTING HITCH BACK!!!.Addenda 2-8-2011: I am corresponding with ""Curt Manufacturing"" as to their take on this now unuseable, fully installed hitch. The ball mount, in addition to being unuseably close to the bumper, is about 2 1/2"" higher than industry standards. (too high for a tow bar or trailer) It is TOTALLY unuseable without a change in the profile of the ball mount. I will in any case be obliged to live with the unsightly low totally visible hitch cross tube, even if a lower, properly profiled ball mount is sourced somehow. My title ""could be better"" is a gross understatement. Make that ""could be useable""....if.....~This is NOT deserving of the 3 stars I assigned to it. No stars at this point..Addenda 3-14-2011: Very good tech. support from Curt Manufacturing. Another ball mount sent no charge, sadly the one sent was as much too low as the first was too high. The Curt staff member stated ""there was no mount between the two"" (in height).At least I can now use the hitch by mounting an additional height ball. Curt Manufacturing tech support a ""10"", hitch design a low ""03"". Hangs way down and looks like ....(close to well but with an 'H') A two star product ~ being generous."
143590,0,"I hate to give only 3 stars, and I bumped that up from 2 out of guilt, but in the Silver Star line up, they're no better than standard Silver Stars.I've had the same set is SS's in my truck for over 5 years. I figured they can't be as bright as when new and Amazon had a great deal on Ultra's so I decided to replace mine. I did so 1 at a time, at night, to see the difference. None. Not brighter, no noticeable pattern difference...nothing.I had 1 replaced so I went ahead and replaced the other. For 1, I'm extremely thrilled with how well the Silver Stars have performed and lasted, but disappointed in the Ultra's for being no better despite the claimed color and pattern difference. If I had gone from stock to the Ultras I would have been thrilled with a huge improvement.The price usually isn't much difference so either one will be a huge improvement over stock, but I'd buy whichever was cheaper; don't expect them to actually perform batter than the 1 step down Silver Stars. Now, if they'll last at least 5+ years. At least I have the old set as replacements...I know they're awesome."

181098,0,"These chaps are very inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. They look okay as long as you do not get closer than a few feet. With the exception of the bottom ten inches, these chaps are not leather, they are made from ""bonded leather"" which is synthetic with ground up leather particles added to it for the smell. You can easily tell that the ""patchwork"" pattern is fake. I do not know what possessed some of the reviewers to say that the leather is thick, or supple, it is not even close to any of that. The workmanship is as cheap as they come, these will definitely not hold up in a crash. The buckle is indeed the worst offender. If you only buy these for looks and some wind protection like I did, you should be fine, but if you want serious protection from the elements or a road slide, look elsewhere."

The cat-back was an aftermarket part and the fitment wasn't the best. I have a dual exhaust and had air leaks on both sides. I applied the sealant while the exhaust was warm and then allowed it to dry over night. It was a really simple procedure, I applied a lot of the sealant all around the connections and even inside the pipes and this completely fixed the problem. It's been about a month now and still no leak. I'll see what happens in the future."

52721,0,"I just received my CP9145 Actron Scanner today... To say that I was surprised by the size of it is an understatement !! Although the Amazon review lists it as: 13 x 5 x 10 inches ; 4 pounds... of which the dimensions are ridiculous... I was not prepared for the large size of this unit. It actually measures about 9 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 1 1/2 and weighs out at a little over 1 pound with the cord attached.I had recently had occasion to have a code read at Autozone on one of my vehicles... and they used an orange scanner which was a nice unit easily held in your hand. I guess I should have asked or noted what unit they were using... It looked a lot like one of the Actron units that I have recently looked at and was prepared to buy. The CP9135 caught my eye as a nice unit, but the CP9145 was somewhat better and at a good price... I really thought I was getting something similar or perhaps the same unit that Autozone uses in their business.Well, I was totally wrong... This thing is huge, and you are barely able to wrap your fingers around the smaller bottom part of the unit.Ok, enough said... you can see that I am totally unimpressed with the size of this thing.I have recently been having a check engine light, on my 1995 Mitsubishi Galant come on. I know.. this scanner is supposed to only check 1996 and later. But my Mitsubishi has an OBDII hook up port... so, I was hoping that this would read my fault code. Well, it doesn't, and it gives me an error that the unit may not be hooked up properly etc..I also have a small handheld unit that just reads the code numbers... and it doesn't read anything on the above vehicle either. I was hoping this unit would read the codes that are causing the problem... but it is no better than the simple two button code reader. Somewhere I am sure I have read that this code scanner will read OBDI codes... Well.. not on a 1995 Mitsubishi it won't..... even with the newer OBDII plug in.Also, I was aware that some reviews have been critical of the short attachment cord. I have to echo those sentiments. There is no reason to supply such a short cord with this unit. The next size up as an accessory, that you can buy for this unit, is something like 8 or 9 feet long !! That is totally stupid !! Why they don't supply it with a 1 1/2 to 3 ft. cord or list it as an accessory, is beyond me !!Those of course are my first impressions with the unit. It may perform flawlessly when attached to a vehicle that is of 1996 or newer vintage. It seems to read ok, and I have no problem with it's workability at the present time.My main problems with the unit, is it's large size and short cord.... Mainly with it's ergonomics. It is totally unhandy to use... and there are no good reasons for it being this way.With further use of the unit, I may place an addendum to this review.. but I doubt that it will change my mind as to the useability or handiness of it. Thank you !!Oh, I just wanted to add... The next time I am in Autozone, I am going to find out what unit they use to check codes for their customers... This gargantuan thing I purchased is not what I really want in my tool box. Again.. Thank you !!"

79732,2,"I'm in the Seattle area and I installed these on my 10 year old Toyota Avalon about seven weeks ago and while they worked adequately for the first few weeks I will end up replacing them this week as they now chatter horribly if you have anything less than a stead downpour, in other words; the type of drizzle Seattle has five months out of the year.I can't speak to the Rain-X properties because I treated my windows with the Rain-X product (which I quite like) a few weeks before purchasing these blades so there was no way to tell how long, or even if, the blades helped. They get two stars for actually removing water from the windshield but I won't be purchasing them again. Do yourself a favor and just use the product on your car and forget their wipers."

The product was easy to install, but the rails slide and my question was if there was a way to tighten them because we attached a snow board rack and want it secure. Never heard a word once I purchased. So I'd say after-the-sale service from Mopar was non-existent."

149332,1,"While this may no be the answer to everyones fueling problems, it certainly solved mine.I have a fifth wheel toy hauler which I take to cmap during hunting season. It has a built in generator and over the course of a weekend, running off and on will use about 15 gallons of gasoline.The fueling design is such that it must be filled very slowly to prevent fuel from backing up and running out on the ground. Also, the mounting of the inlet really prevents one from refilling with 5 gallon cans.This works great, I can start the fuel flow, and adjust the flow with the ball valve to a trickle with no backflow problems. I can also leave it unattended while it fills up.While it is a tad heavy to be moving around, if you can do your refilling from the back of a pickup truck, it should work out good for you.I mounted it on a 2"" X 12"" board cut to the length of the tank.This stabilizes it more, and allows you to slide it around easier in the bed of your truck once filled."

166252,1,"This is a 2 wire O2 Sensor set and I extensively researched which O2 sensor replacement I needed for my Toyota Corolla 1997. It wasn't fun but if I ordered the wrong one than that is time and money wasted. Do you need upstream or downstream O2 Sensor? Check other online resources to get the right fit. This is the Upstream O2 Sensor I needed for my Toyota Corolla 1997 that got a CEL with error code P0133 (Bank 1 Sensor 1). There is the Denso 234-2000 Universal Oxygen sensor which is the same but I needed to solder and I didn't really care to take the time to do that and chose this one where it is just an easy install and plug in (No solder or splicing needed). When I removed the old O2 sensor, it was in much need of replacing with all the build up. It also came with Anti-Seize lubricant, make sure to apply that so it doesn't get stuck if next time you need to do a replacement. You can't go wrong as I will update over the next months if any issues arises."
21127,1,"I purchased the FIAMM Freeway Blaster to add to the stock horn on my Mazda 3. If anyone drives a Mazda 3 then you should know the stock horn is pretty weak. The install took about 30 minutes, mostly because it was hard fitting my hands in such a small space. If you have small hands it will only take about ten minutes if that, and it does help if you have removed the stock air box and have a SRI or a CAI installed. If you are planning on having both the stock and this horn on you will need to make a wire harness that will connect both horns to the car. If you have fog lamps you will have a slightly harder time getting it in only do to the space issue. Comment and ask if you need help with the install!The FIAMM horn is a match to the stock horn but this one is a low-tone rather than the high-tone that is on the car. Having both creates a dissonance in sound and is much louder and noticeable than having one or the other on. Also, it isn't so loud that people are going to flip out or create a bad situation. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to upgrade your stock horn or just replacing it."

187655,1,"The Bon-Aire inflator does the job. It easily inflated the tires in my vehicle, although the cord is short that was an easy fix as everyone has some form of an extention cord around the house. The problem I had was the air pressure gauge reader. It seem to give me a higher pressure reading than the two individual tire pressure gauges that I normally use. I also drove my car to a local auto service center to determine if my gauges or Bone Aires guages were closer. The auto service center gauges pretty much matched my tire gauges more so than the one on the Bon-Aire. However, the main reason I bought Bon Aire was not only to inflate by auto tires but other household items such as air mattresses, basketballs, and pool floating products, etc.. and it has served well, but for auto tires have a back-up tire pressure gauge."
145768,2,"After using the H7 Silverstar in two cars over the last few years, I have given up on them. As noted in some of the other reviews, the light is pretty good, but they have a very short life. I was lucky if I got 6 months out of a lamp, and that gets very expensive quickly. If you are looking for longer life from the ""Ultra"" Silverstar bulbs, forget about it! Same problem - burn out after a few months, and you are facing the replacement expense (let alone the hassle of changing bulbs, and the increased risk of getting ticketed for headlamp out!)."
149313,0,This is a nice tank to carry additional fuel in the back of your truck if you're heading into the unknown. I found it to be very useful in my journeys into the desert. The one and only real draw back is the tank had lots of slag left inside after the welding was finished. I had to take a magnet and sweep the bottom of the tank several times to get the majority of it out.

155148,1,I like the wolo 519. It's a great thing having a horn ayour bike to keep cars from running in your lane. The will keep a bad driver from doing bad things to you. The is loud and it is easy to install. I had to add one piece of angle over top of bolt slot. This will keep the bolt from jumping out of slot. Other than that it's good product.
166866,2,"I bought expensive coverking products for my car thinking they would fit and match. After all, there are only 3 different interior colors for my year. Boy, was I wrong. The color was waaaay off. So bad that it just looked ridiculous. I sent it back, and not only did I have to pay shipping to me and shipping back, they had the nerve to charge me a 15% restocking fee for finding out that their product is stupidly off color. DO NOT BUY from this company unless you have seen the color in a retail store somewhere."
104753,1,"The kit arrived in a too large box with lots of packing paper but everything was there. The step-by-step instructions were easy to follow but the assembly diagram was a little hard to read without a magnifier. You basically remove the stock air box, transplant the mass air flow sensor, mount the new box and install the new intake tube and provided K&N; filter. The hardest part for me was getting the crankcase vent tube disconnected from the stock air box because it was on there really good and it is a tight space. Moving the mass air flow sensor was a little tricky too because it didn't quite line up with the mounting holes. In all it took me 90 minutes at a leisurely pace. The car started normally and no warning lights came on.I like the sound of the new setup. I can't really say I can feel the additional HP, but I do like the way it opens up the engine compartment. One should note that the intake tube where it goes into the K&N; box is not sealed. This means part of the air could come from the engine compartment rather than the fresh air tube coming from the fender. Perhaps that is to accommodate demands for lots of air during hard acceleration.Be aware you will need a #20 and #27 Torx driver to complete the installation. All other tools are standard fare."

78098,1,"Amazon keeps suggesting that I review this, so I guess I will.It is, indeed, a metal license plate, just as the description promised. It was clean and shiny, came with nice instructions, in case you need them for some reason. Even without them the installation was pretty basic.I've had this plate on my car for about a month or so now and couldn't be happier. It was exactly what I thought I was getting and on the back of the plate it says that it's an officially licensed Ford product, which is even better!I guess the one useful thing I could say is that the picture in the ad is pretty poor. I was a little scared that I would be getting a flat piece of metal with the Lincoln symbol just stamped on, but no. The picture is misleading. The Lincoln symbol is 3-D and very high quality looking."
15641,1,"My Winnipeg mechanic said he could get ignition coils for between $170 and $200 each locally. I nearly fainted, but once recovered did a quick search at Amazon. These were available with Amazon Worldship (in this case, arrived via DHL), and my single ignition coil arrived next business day and was installed effortlessly. As a Florida snowbird I'm used to using my Prime account to source things quickly and economically while in the US. When in Canada I'm at a loss as to where to turn. Hopefully more of the selection of Amazon USA will be made available in Canada, especially auto parts."

175853,0,"I installed these wires on my '98 Corolla last year. They fit fine and work, but the wire insulation is not molded or secured to either end. Gaps can form easily if you're not careful to push the insulation back in place. In general, this set just feels flimsy, especially compared to the OEM wires. Truth be told, I bought it for the Bosch name and the ""Premium"" on the package but there is definitely nothing premium about the product.--UPDATE--After reading a couple of other reviews for this, I want to emphasize that this spark plug wire set fits and works fine. It is just that I replaced them with NGK spark plug wires (the blue ones) and I think there is a big difference in quality. I also tried different types of spark plugs through the years but finally went back to the original DENSO ones. I realize I should have stuck with Toyota's recommendations all along for NGK and DENSO parts. They cost more but I do think they make the car run almost like it did when I purchased it new."
9890,0,"The PBT 200 had no product description for operating ranges. This only tests up to 900 CCA which many batteries exceed. For only $20 more, the PBT 300 has a much wider testing range. No fault of Amazon, the test specs are not even on the Midtronics website. This is an ok product, but the PBT 300 is an all around better product because of its wider testing capabilities."
187300,1,It was exactly what my husband wanted. It matched the interior of his truck perfectly and adds a little more comfort to the ride.
185961,0,"I think that the concept of this item is great. I have trouble walking and often need to sit down where there are no chairs. I was very excited about this before I got it, but I'm a bit disappointed now. First, I'd like to point out that even though this has three legs, the two side legs are too short to add extra stability. (If you need the stability of a quad cane, this won't work well for you.) Second, while the idea is nice, I am an average sized female, and the seat itself is way too small to be comfortable for any length of time. The seat size looks to be just right for my friend's three year old. If you find 7 1/2"" square seats comfortable, you'll be fine. The seat is a tad high for me and cane height is fine for me. (I'm about 5'6"".) I would think that seat would be too high to be comfortable for someone much shorter, and the cane height would be too short for someone much taller than I am. (Neither is adjustable.) Someone on the regular sport seat page suggested making a larger cushion, which I plan to do.This certainly won't replace a chair if you have to sit for long periods of time, but it might make getting around easier--which is the point. I'm glad someone invented this. Now I just wish they'd make small, medium and large sizes!"
81894,1,"Easy to instal and a lot easier to clean/replace the filter then the stock. Has a great sound, you can hear the air going in... The only issue I have with it is the first bend from the intake rubs on the hood. Also with the filter at the top of the engine compartment it does not get as much cool air as would like but then this is a short ram intake not a CAI. as far as performance it is not significant by itself."

13111,0,The easy way to say it is the picture for this product is very misleading. Dont expect to get what you see. The pic in advertisement is the actual OEM piece. Thats not what you get though. It comes in 2 pieces with adapter plate. Adapter plate works but not even close to the original.So far the sensor works but will have to see how long it lasts.... It would be nice if the ads were pics of what you actually get.
14079,0,"For the record, I have a a nasty tendency of trying and experimenting with different car care products, usually with middling results. My daily driver, a well worn 2001(170K mileage) Mirage is usually my guinea pig. The car from the factory has single stage(no clear coat). The advantage is that it is very easy to correct problems with the paint. The disadvantage is that it is very easy to tell when it is time to polish the paint. (the paint takes a slightly chalky feel when protection fails; think mid 80's-early nineties red Toyotas with pinkish paint).On with the review. Spraying LD with the heavily hyped battery operated sprayer works well. The sprayer distributes evenly but really no better than a manual sprayer. In fact, my sprayer quit working(even with fresh batteries) after several applications. I placed the product in a regular spray bottle and use it that way now.Simonize LD has a light,almost baby oil consistency (akin to Turtle Wax Ice). It goes on well, very easy to remove and imparts a nice shine.Negatives:*The motorized sprayer is essentially worthless.*(I am nitpicking here) It is not a polish. That is, a product with even mild corrective abilities. It imparts a nice shine, but does not remove imperfections (mild swirls). So for a legitimate swirl free shine, a dedicated polish is required. This is strictly for protection, nothing else.*Was expensive compared to others in the market. One can find it at a discount now.Positives:*Ease of use and ease of removal*Works well on windows*Nice crisp shine and a very good addition to traditional waxes*The package includes a MF cloth and 2 washing mitts. Very good value now that the product is discounted"
5975,2,"This is not a real motor oil. It is refined vegetable oil.This is a type 2 or 3 ""synthetic"" oilI was very disappointed when I put this in all 4 of my vehicles, and very soon after (about 5,000 miles or so) they all developed leaks. The shop that put it in all of my cars has been in business more than 35 years and are going strong on the corner of the 101 and vista way in Oceanside, Ca. The owner was shocked and told me that i wasn't the only customer with these kind of complaints, and stated that other customers were burning oil when they never had a problem before. so most people try this stuff and love it right away, and then go out to make a review before they see the problems. Much like a full tank of gas seems to make a car run better in ones mind (or a clean car) these don't have anything to do with a vehicle running. This oil is nothing more than refined and dyed vegetable oil. This oil will shorten the life of any motor and it burns off or creates leaks because of its structure.More than being a huge money maker for the team who markets it as a high performance product, this oil will soon find itself as part of a class action lawsuit. Read the forums online and you will see for yourself. Mechanics will tell you the same thing - stay away from this product and be careful when buying ""synthetic"" type 2 and 3 oils"
34161,1,"I needed extra space to bring my craft products home to FL and decided a rooftop carrier would be what I should get. After reading the reviews of several different ones, this one seemed to be the one I should get and I'm glad I did. It is lightweight, easy to set up and load and tie down. Based on one review I placed everything in plastic bags and I'm glad I did since it did leak a little. I had no problems with the straps or with wind noise. I am very pleased with this product."
127844,0,I like the clear display and the lighted display too. Only trouble was after 2 times using I felt like something pushed in and there wasn't any diplay. Luckily it was a quick fix I could handle. I took fine nose pliers and slightly and gently pulled the protruding plastic piece that lies in the middle of the gauge where the valve stem sits in and pulled it out. I felt a little movement and it works. Saved an exchange. Hopefully will last a few years now.

185158,2,"Had to replace a gas line on a string trimmer that passed through the gas tank. The replacement hose was just a bit smaller than the original, allowing gas to seep out when the tank was filled.I purchased this product after reading the reviews. I cleaned off the hose and the area of the tank where it passed through with a good degreaser, let it dry for about 1/2 hour, then applied the sealant. Waited over 24 hours before putting gas in the tank. As soon as I filled the tank, gas began seeping from between the hose and the sealant instead of between the hose and the tank.Seems like it will be a good adhesive for other uses, just not the one I bought to use it on."

123520,1,"After doing the research across price, functionality, ease of use, durability, storage, and weather proofing, I decided on the Highland carrier. For $30, you get an incredible amount of storage, that is secure on your roof, and totally waterproof. This Xmas, I drove from the Northern VA area (DC) way up to Upstate New York (Past Albany) and back with this carrier [in the rain and snow up and back both ways - all stuff was totally dry]. 900 total miles at about 75 MPH.Here is what you need to know before buy: You have to have a roof rack with crossbars as the carrier's four straps attach to this; the space between the crossbars must be 38 inches so you will need to adjust this on your car first; and don't expect it to look like the picture once on your car/SUV unless your packages/stuff is exactly the dimensions of the bag. During installation do not attach the four straps, that is, fill the carrier on your roof, then attach the four crossbar straps as you will need the wiggle room for secure placement on your roof. After installation I suggest simply tucking/knotting the excess strap as these flap in the wind and will drive you crazy (takes an extra 2 minutes). Also, for piece of mind as I mentioned that unless your stuff is a perfect 39x18x38 rectangle the carrier looks a big lump on your car so I put two 48 inch bungey cords across the width of the carrier. You don't need the cords, but I am a little anal-retentive.You will be impressed with the ultra thick material this thing is made of. Only four straps connect to your car which you will make suspect their ability to hold this thing down...but they do, and they don't budge. I can confidently say this THE best purchase I have made to date. You get way more than what you pay for on this carrier.While driving I saw other people with the Thule soft carrier and Rainex, both of these are smaller, do not have the top strap adjustment like the Highland so they flap in the wind, plus read their reviews - they are not water tight. I guess if you have the $200-300 for a hard card carrier, go for it, but what do these people do with these when they are not using them? This Highland carrier folds back down to a shoebox size...you can't beat that either.You really do not need to read anymore reviews, take my word, buy this carrier if you need extra space at an wickedly affordable price, that is secure on your car, keeps your stuff dry, and folds aways for easy storage."
96054,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
108584,1,"Never fails to amaze me. Amazon congrates on your great prices.Pro Comp congrates on your great products.I replaced all 6 shocks & the steering stabilzer on my truck and WOWwhat a great improvement in ride and handling.One suggestion to Pro Comp ""include a shock boot with your truck shocks"""
188367,2,"Imagine giving this device to your 16 year old. Imagine he encounters circumstances to put it to use. Now imagine it fails to work. How would you feel about your gift?I ordered 6 of these as Christmas stocking-stuffers. Fortunately, my 16 year old tested the glass breaking function of his on a piece of scrap hard plastic.No matter how hard we tried we couldn't get the pin to 'pop'. The barrel simply moved in and out with no effect.I handed him another. The pin popped as it should but then remained stuck in the extended position. In actual use that would have meant one try to break the glass and then the device would have been useless.I tested the remaining 4 and they did, in fact, function as advertised and demonstrated. I don't think a device like this ought to have what basically amounts to a 33% failure rate on the 6 I purchased.If you buy them, TEST them. Then consider installing the full-sized hammer as a back-up."

174239,1,"The item It was just like described on the details , it was in a brand new condition and also I didn't have to wait too long for the item to arrived so i am very pleased."
184695,2,NOT HAPPY AT ALL !!!The picture of this item is NOT correct. I needed two black faced fuel pressure gauges so I ordered these Holley gauges because the picture shown on Amazon's site shows a black faced gauge. INSTEAD I received two white faced gauges. Amazon does allow a replacement but NOT a refund. There's no reason for me to get a replacement only to receive two more white faced gauges. I have since ordered two black faced pressure gauges (as shown on their site) from Jegs. Amazon better get their act together and double check the pictures they show on their site and what they actually offer for sale. I now have two Holley white faced fuel pressure gauges gathering dust.
8753,1,I bought a used ford truck and both factory mirrors were broken. I bought these and was worried because the price was so cheap for electric mirrors. These are almost exact looking factory mirrors. I'm very please with the look quality and performance of these mirrors.
41606,0,"First of all this is not a $$$$ helmet, so you get what you pay for. That being said the CL-MAX offers some great specs and features for very little cost in the modular/flip up helmet category.The Good - Exceptional vision. The visor area is HUGE. Comfort is on par with other HJC helmets for my shape of head. I didn't have any hot spots to speak of during break in. The chin bar is easily manipulated with one hand and has a solid click when it closes.The Bad - The big visor fogs easily because of the lack of nose cup to redirect breath. Also the venting is sub par even on a bike where you get full wind in the face. I usually end up riding with my visor up part way just for more fresh air and to decrease fogging. Lastly the non glare paint job scratches easily.Other thoughts - Modular helmets meet DOT/Snell standards for the cranium bucket only. That chin bar is just for looks and the wind, so don't expect a lot of protection in a crash. I freeze my chin off in this helmet on cold ( &lt;40F ) days because of the lack of wind protection on the chin bar. Nolan has a nice system that works with modular helmets. HJC should think of adopting something like that."

29721,0,"Cheap pressure gauge on expensive product. Internal screws came out so dial would spin. Then needle was erratic. Can't service. Replacement on mfg site only $4.00 but $11.49 shipping and you get the same junk pressure guage. Instead went to Amazon and got Winters P9S 90 Series Steel Dual Scale Pressure Gauge with Removable Lens, 0-30 psi/kpa, 1-1/2"" Dial Display, +/-2-1-2% Accuracy, 1/8"" NPT Center Back Mount http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0087TVSK2/ref=biss_dp_t_asn for $9.50 and free shipping. Screws right in and is much better quality. This is a great replacement if you have the same issue. Otherwise this item has worked well. I made another hose section and use it to pump differential lube too."
56677,1,Good price on the struts. Went in really nice and easy. I'd buy the whole system again as it made strut instalation so straight forward. Shipping was fast too.

157489,2,"First of all the image displayed of the mount is not correct. This is front mount for maxima and look different. I did get the correct part based on the part number. Bought two of these to replace old nissan oem mounts. The mounts look solid and well made when new. Everything was perfect for about 6 months. The car drove really well, but then I noticed that both mounts had their centers shifted outward by at least 6mm. Needless to say the alignment by then was completely out and the inner tire tread had worn out much more than the outer tread. The mounts completely fell apart in about 10 months. The car was actually only driven about 8k miles in those 10 months. Bottom line... the mounts are poorly built and do not hold up in long run. The original nissan oem mounts lasted over 12 years/130k miles in dry and hot AZ weather. The nissan oem mounts are not that expensive.. go with the oem mounts. The aftermarket KYB are not worth the money/labor involved in putting new mounts."
46268,1,it works well enough but the quality isn't quite there. and now i need five more words to finish this.
7082,1,The system worked as advertised. It was delivered in a timely manner and in good shape. Will recommend this item to ther persons who are in search of a similar item.

39786,1,"Around 160,000 miles the OE thermostat stuck open on my 2007 Silverado Classic WT/ Vortec V6 (LU3). Since the factory thermostat lasted as long as it did, I figured I would replace it with the Delco in the hope I won't have to replace it again for the life of the vehicle. The job was fairly easy. Be advised, this IS a 195 degree thermostat. Also, the gasket that comes with this thermostat is slightly smaller than the OE. This concerned me, but I haven't had any leaks or issues since replacing it three months ago. Otherwise the fit is perfect."

3148,0,we will see after it rains...... as far as the product clean for now.... packing was superb and all was well
168692,2,"Very disappointing. The build quality is not bad at all, pretty rugged construction. The unit is fairly large, unnecessarily, does not seem to have a lot of circuitry inside that justifies the large size. The LED is RED ! The product display picture shows an LCD display. This is NOT the case, its RED LEDs, just awful ! thats so old school. Tested it on my car battery Before a 14 mile road trip and it displayed FAILED. After the trip I tested it again and it reported PASS. So which is it ? Is the battery good or bad - this is confusing. OTC's own manual does NOT even endorse its tool'sresults - ""....MAY indicate a bad battery..."". Capable of detecting a surface charge - NOT ! After driving for 14 milesit was supposed to detect that, but it didnt. Driving 14 miles and testing the battery and it cannot dectect a surface charge ? How accurate can this tool really be ? Dropped it down to 1 star from 2 stars. I just use it for an expensive voltmeter now. Also, The power cable is negative and positive (twin wires), NOT the single black cable as displayed in the picture.I recommend DO NOT buy. OTC is generally known for good automotive products but this one sucks !Purchase a basic carbon pile tester instead ! Its much more accurate, rugged, reliable and cheaper.If you are rich you can buy the Argus Digital Battery Analyzer or a digital battery analyzer frommidtronics. Those are top-notch stuff."
149937,0,"The product is as presented, but unfortunately did not provide the level of relief anticipated. It does provide some relief while sleeping, which is enhanced by the fact you can adjust the level of inflation. Worked better when sleeping on one's side as opposed to sleeping on one's back."

33300,0,I bought this because it's a reasonable price for neoprene seat covers. When they came in I really liked their feel and they were easy to install. But I discovered I only got the 2 seat covers and the console cover was missing. I contacted Amazon who promptly shipped me out a new set. I opened the box and again the console cover is missing.I've sent back both sets to Amazon for a refund and I'll be buying them from Coverking directly.
182742,1,"This has been a time consuming task...So to help out the next guy who has a Kodiak or Bruin, I think 1999 - 2004, could be wrong.But here are the parts you need to add a plow to your bike:Superwinch 2202855 Mount Kit - You will need to get a Roller Fairlead. This kit does not come with one. There is one which comes with the winch, but you will have to cut the holes because the holes will not line up with the Superwinch Mount Kit. This is the worst part of the install. Get a hammer and bring a lot of patients. It is difficult to align holes for the mount with the frame and the ATVs push bars. The mount is a very tight fit for sliding over the frame mount, then the bumper bar attaches to the mount to the frame using the bolts in the hardware kit.Warn 62100 Plow Base - It has to be this one because of the age of the bike. The newer model plow bases are to wide and will not mount to the bike.Warn 64670 Yamaha ATV Plow Mounting Kit - This is specific for the bike. I had mine mounted in about twenty minutes.WARN 68200 ATV Cyclone Angled Plow Blade - I did the 60"" blade so I could get the largest cut and funnel it from the bike.Warn 67870 ATV Plow Blade Control Flap - I added this to keep as much snow as possible off of me. The blade was not made to accept this. But the mounting hardware is included and I was able to drill the blade and install the rubber in ten minutes.Warn 69212 Cyclone Blade Premium Skids - I ordered extra of these. There is a pair which came with the blade. These drag on the road and I figure they will wear quickly with the weight of the blade resting on them then dragging the asphault.I went with a 2000 pound winch. I won't comment on that.A winch is pretty much a winch if you are only going to use it to lift and lower the blade a few inches.The winch itself is really easy to install.The worse part was pulling off the bike's tupperware to route the wires out of site.Hope this helps.Good Luck, you will need it when installing the winch mount."

Also the gasket is not as wide.It looks like the same plain white Purolator filters I used to buy at K-Mart for $2, except for the box and krinkle finish.

68970,1,"works great, easy to install,fit perfectly in air box. to install on none touring model with mock tank you open door to gas cap.remove all screws and 2 on front of tank. be careful, tank is 2 seperate parts. lift up instrument panel.slide tank apart a little, remove screw, lift out filter, put in new, put in screw, slide tank parts back in place, insert instrument panel,run screws back in. It is a good idea to have someone help you by holding the instrument panel up out of the way due to wires attached and so you dont scratch the tank. Also, when removing screws, look out for washers, so when you lift instrument panel, you dont lose them or drop them in the gas filler tube, because gas cap must be removed."

A couple things i recommend after using this charger are: keeping an eye on the clamps they get hot on high charging rate with high CCA battery, and on 6 volt low it is not a trickle charger, so don't leave timer on to long. All that said it is a good value for a small fleet or farm in a big charger."

I took it apart to try to fix it, I found it must be internal and I could not fix it. But at that point, it was too late to send back because the whole unit was in pieces and could not be fixed. Out it went in the trash."
75631,0,I bought this in the store some years back. It looks great and the picture of the dragon lasted longer than I thought it would. I expected it to rub off within a few months but it held. My only major gripe is that it heated up right along with Cali summer temperatures where heat waves and droughts run rampant. Not only that it also held the heat in even with the A/C on making it difficult to drive for a while if you didn't have time to wait for it to cool down. I ended up replacing it with something fuzzier.

12552,1,"The Yakima Megawarrior is a great cargo basket, designed to get your packages out of the vehicle and on the roof. It has quality construction, and the hardware is well thought out and easily installed. I use this on a Thule rack, but the install was easy. I am a bit concerned of how the mega warrior attaches to the Thule rack, as the rack bolts to the Thule square load bars. The clamping brackets are composite material, and from past experience with Yakima universal kit mount to square load bars, I have had cracking of the clamps that lead to on road repairs. The additional accessories are somewhat expensive, in my opinion, particularily the spare tire holder as well as the high lift jack braket. Both items are over 70 dollars each. Hopfully this will stand the test of time. I have more experience with Thule products, and find them to be consitently good. Others swear by Yakima, but I have a had a few problems as mentioned above, including 2 anckle biter bike racks that I can't seem to keep at 90 degrees on the load bars. Havn't lost a bike, but it is a little unervinig for me to see my 2000.00 Trek loaded up at 90 and arrive at my destination crooked. Yakima dosn't make them anymore. perhaps for that reason.

112392,0,"This stabilizer is lower in cost and lighter weight than others on the US market. I'm using it on a utility trailer to ease loading. It works well in combination with wheel chocks. I can't recommend using the stabilizer by itself on trailers, as slopes or high wind combined with wheel movement could twist the frame. The screw and nut need to be greased during install. I used white lithium from spray can and that works well. It's easy to crank up and down with the supplied tool. The problem is there are no stops to prevent going too far when lowering. There was no damage from over-extending the legs, but you must apply some pressure on the front of a leg while cranking to get threads engaged and raise it. This stabilizer will work well on small RVs with parking brakes set. The directions are clear but should emphasize the need to prevent rolling."

48250,1,"Roy Rogers was known as the King of the Cowboys. When his career started to take off he was making up to six movies a year and had the world's largest fan club (at the time). He eventually had his own tv show and made several radio serials. Cowboy heroes, like most other heroes, had to have a sidekick. The difference with cowboys is that their sidekicks tend to be their horse. Roy Roger was no exception as his horse Trigger became just as famous as he. Trigger starred in all of Roy's movies and was on the tv show, too. When Trigger died in 1965, Roy decided to have the horse stuffed and placed in the Roy Rogers Musuem, even though Roy's wife, Dale Evans, wasn't too thrilled with the idea.This bumper sticker is a clever allusion to Roy Rogers and Trigger. Trigger, the horse, doesn't want anymore hay because he's been to the taxedermist and is literally stuffed. This is a great bumper sticker to own because not very many people will understand the reference and those who do will appreciate you."

Only after I applied it to the hood of my car I saw that this product should not be applied to objects in direct sunlight. Before that I used the Por-15 on a battery tray under the hood and it holds up great. The parts on top of the hood I applied are now peeling and turning grey. Not too enthused with only being able to use rustproofing on some parts of the car.

33626,2,"Update: After just a few short months the low heat no longer works. High heat still works but now I'm forced to turn it off after a few minutes because it gets too hot. The low setting was perfect for me, I could drive all the way to work without getting too hot. Now I have to keep flipping the switch. It's not even worth sending it back since I only paid $14. It's just so disappointing when something you really liked fails so quickly.Original review:Amazon has a knack for knowing exactly what you need and when (it's actually getting spooky). The heated cushion I bought last year on fleebay failed miserably and got returned (FYI, the previous POS heated seat cushion was also sold under the Peak brand name, so please stay away from those.)I wanted to try another before it really got cold this winter and as soon as I logged onto Amazon this little beauty showed up on a time limited sale for $14 with free shipping! I figured I'd give it a shot. As always I received it immediately. I didn't bother attaching it to the seat since my hopes weren't high enough to warrant spending the extra time in case it didn't work. I just laid it there and sat down. In no time my buns were getting warm and so was my back! Amazing! Someone actually made a product do what it's supposed to do, cheaply and effectively.Luckily for me, my car has a switched cigarette lighter so I don't need to unplug it everytime. I can leave it on low and it will begin heating as soon as I start the car.The only drawbacks are the cord does appear to be rather short for using on the passenger side. You cannot avoid it, the cord is positioned on the right so it will be a longer run to the center console from the passenger seat. And as stated in other reviews the attachment straps appear rather weak but I can live with that as long as it keeps working."

8214,1,"I've done a few oil changes with the Fram SureDrain already in place and have come to the conclusion that for the price it's very good, but it has some minor flaws that may be an inconvenience for some.First of all lets look at the pros. It's made of brass, it comes with a copper washer, it has a backup system if the valve fails, it's also low cost. Now lets look at the cons. You need to screw on a plunger cap with an attached hose to open the valve, the oil takes awhile to drain if you don't open the oil cap on top of your engine.Now, for me the pros far outweigh the cons. In my experience the slow oil draining issue can be easily remedied if you just open the oil filler cap on the top of your engine to release pressure from the draining oil. By doing this it allows the oil to drain much faster. As to the stiff hose, it would've been better if the hose was made of soft silicone to allow it to flex while you screw the plunger cap on. That said, if you want to be creative you could probably buy a plastic valve to attach to the hose to allow more control over when you're ready to start the draining process instead of letting the plunger initiate it."

The Thule fairing sits on top of the sunroof of my wagon and creates a huge down draf into the cabin during freeway speeds. This should be a foot note to anyone who owns a vehicle that has the cross rails sitting direcly behind the sunroof. A fairing works better if it sits directly in front the vehicle sunroof.

102230,1,if you are into tuning bikes this is a great exhaust to have. allows you to dial in the torque exactly where you want it in the rpm range. also helps to compensate for altitude changes and you dont need to build a new exhaust ever time you have changes to the engine.another side benefit is that it makes life easier for the guys riding behind you as the sound wave doesnt hit them directly in the face. after riding with loud exhausts for years i find this much more comfortable on the highways(can actually listen to music) without losing out on performance. and it lasts a long time.the black finish scratches and gets destroyed very easily. honestly i dont think it sounds very good or thumpy but it gets the job done.you can carry it from bike to bike.

177589,1,"I installed these airbags on a 2005 Toyota Sienna. Installation was easy, but make sure the ground is dry and try to do it when it is warm as you'll be spending a lot of time lying under your vehicle.It should first be noted that these don't increase the carrying capacity of the vehicle. The weight limits of the tires, wheels and axle aren't increased. What it does is allow you to sit level and ride more comfortably even when loaded. If you are thinking about these consider first that most minivans (including my Sienna) have pitifully small carrying capacity. The GVWR won't allow you to carry a full compliment of adults in the seats let alone any significant storage. Many minivans fully loaded with the soccer team and all their gear are over the GVWR on a regular basis. I've put my minivan on the scale with 2 adults, 2 small kids and luggage for a week vacation and found I was at GVWR. (having pointed this out I am now able to convince the wife to pack a little lighter).Installation of these bags was done in under an hour but I'm anal and spent a lot of that time finding a clean place to mount the filler valve and route the lines. I put the valve in the gas filler area concealed behind the door. Unfortunately the Sienna filler area is formed with soft rubber rather than metal or plastic like some other vehicles so the valve is not mounted as rigidly as I would like, but it keeps the valve clean and is conveniently located. I considered mounting the bags upside down like another reviewer suggested. I think that would protect the lines a bit better but the minivan is not an offroad vehicle so I decided that the airlines would be safe and I went with the recommended installation which has the airlines enter from the bottom of the coil spring.When the vehicle is jacked up during installation there is a lot of extra space above the bag and I was initially concerned that I got the wrong size but when sitting on the wheels there is much less space left and as soon as a load is put in it sits on the bag. The ride at the rear is a little firmer but nobody else in the family has even noticed. The ride height now stays level even when loaded up to GVWR even without much air. I found that I put about 10psi in and even empty it isn't too bouncy and that is sufficient for a full load as well. I only check the pressure to see if the bags have leaked but so far after 2 months and 3 lengthy trips including 2 in the snow there has been no leakage at all.On initial inspection I was concerned that the material and parts were of inferior quality and I was inimpressed. It is not the same product as the air suspension for my HD truck but it is also only a fraction of the cost. I don't know how long the bags will last inside the springs because there must be wear but so far they have worked extremely well and are showing no signs of wear or of issues. I am reassured by the positive reviews that everyone else has posted. I'll update this review if they show signs of wear after a longer time. In the mean time I would recommend them to anyone who would like to resolve the sag issue when loading up their minivan. But I would stress the initial note that a minivan is not intended to carry heavy loads and this may hide the fact that you are overloaded."

The process left most of the leg work in my court even though the error was Amazon's. The biggest hassle was having to take the parts to the post office myself instead of Amizon doing this on their end. The people I dealt with were polite, but I still wish companies like Amazon would stop outsourcing to India. I never feel that the person on the otherside really get what I am saying. Sure they speak English, but there is a culture gap that leaves you unsure if they really understand the context of what you saying. I guess my lession here is to double check the part number somewhere else to confirm compatibility with my vehicle myself and not completely trust Amazon's device."

Amazon has since changed the desription to reflect what the correct purpose of the tool is."
141257,0,"This is one of those products that is very much borderline for its advertised use. The panel rating claims a maximum of 125mA, but that's under fairly ideal conditions. Since this panel isn't rated for outdoor use, it will sit behind a car's windshield. Your typical piece of glass will absorb about 8% of the sun's energy. Adding to that a less-than-perfect install and you're lucky to get half that 1.8W rating.I performed my tests in December, when the sun is at its lowest in the sky and the days are shortest(unless you live in Australia, then forget what i just said) . I live in northern California, which isn't ideal for solar, but is much better than many parts of the USA in terms of daily solar energy received.Performance on an OVERCAST December day, near solar noon:-Voc or open circuit voltage was 13.3V-Isc or short circuit current, a whopping 1.8mA-Charging current to battery was 0.18mA. The battery was at 12.0V at the time.Performance on a SUNNY December day, near solar noon:-Voc or open circuit voltage was 20V-Isc or short circuit current was 60mA behind the car's windshield. Pointed directly at the sun and not behind glass, the panel managed 87mA.-Charging current to battery was 50mA. The battery was at 12.0V at the time.My sunny measurement was taken 3 days after the overcast measurement. My car drains the battery at 45mA continuously. Given that the solar panel is lucky to deliver decent power 8 hours a day, roughly three times the drain current is needed to keep the battery charged. This is beyond this panel's capabilities, even on a nice summer day. Given the 50mA of charge current delivered on a sunny winter day, the panel was barely keeping up with the discharge during the day and the rest of the time the battery was losing charge. As I didn't want to get stuck with a sub-par setup, I opted not to keep this unit.The packaging states there is overcharge and overdischarge protection. While a diode does keep the panel from running ""backwards"" at night and draining your battery, it has no overcharge protection whatsoever. The manufacturer is relying on the panel's low output to keep you from toasting your battery. If you were to use this product on a motorcycle, you may possibly overcharge your battery, as i'm expecting their battery drain to be virtually nil, aside from the usual self-discharge of a battery.I have since decided to build my own solar car charger using a 10W Instapark panel and a Morningstar Sun Guard solar charge controller. While this setup will end up costing about $70 it will produce plenty of power to keep the battery topped off in all but the worst weather days. It's also using a quality controller to properly charge the battery, without worry of overcharging it. This setup will work with virtually any lead-acid battery and should be useful for many years.Whatever solar charging system you opt to buy, I suggest you do the following simple calculation:1. Take whatever panel you want to buy and cut its current rating in HALF. In this case, that's 62.5mA.2. Now that you have a more realistic figure, divide it by 3. Since the panel will only produce decent power about 1/3 of the day, 'tis the reason for this division. In this case, averaged output of the 1.8W panel will be ~20mA.3. Measure the drain on your car battery. If the car battery drain is less than what we just calculated, you'll likely be OK. If it's higher, you'll need a bigger panel. I'm currently of the opinion that a 5W panel WITH a charge controller is the way to go for many people. My 10W setup will be only slightly more costly and give extra ""headroom"" for when the sun isn't shining as bright.On a final note, take into consideration where the car is parked. To get any power out of a solar panel, the panel will need DIRECT sunlight. Park it in a carport and you can forget it. If it's in a shady spot half the day, you'll need to double the size of the panel you buy. I live in an apartment with lots of shade. There are a few spots available that offer a good view to the south most of the day. I'll be taking advantage of those spaces to keep the panel size to a minimum.This product is reasonably well-built for its low price. I think it earns its average 3-star rating due to the misleading advertising of having overcharge protection (it doesn't) and the likelyhood it won't deliver the goods for many applications."

The tube is also pretty small on the inside diameter, which makes it a bit slow, but it works. A larger tube would be faster, but would be a bulkier as well.If you're looking for something fast or for using on viscous liquids like oil, probably best to look elsewhere.

24463,0,"Just installed this last night on my 2007 STi.I knew I was going to have to remove the diffuser (never had any real faith in it actually doing anything in the first place - so no loss there). You also have to remove a mounting plate that holds the diffuser in place near the bumper. You also have to remove the driver side rear tie down hook and exhaust hanger as well as the passenger side tie down hook. (If you don't know what I'm referring to, the tie downs are what they use to hold the vehicle in place during shipping or for a flat tow).The fit is very tight. The passenger side theres a black box with a vacuum tube going into it (not actually sure what it does) about 6-8 inches by about 2 inches by 4-6 inches. Its mounted with rubber bushings so it has a little play in it and the hitch takes up all of that play (ergo tight fit...)I have a Cobb turbo back exhaust and I was able to *make* it work, but I can't same I'm particularly please about it... The mounting bolts on the driver side cover up one of the holes for the left hand exhaust hanger, and you can't use the supplied bolt for that side as the hole and the attachment point on the muffler are too close together. I remounted the hanger with one bolt instead of the two it wants. The right hand hanger is too far by just a little bit, and this is really where the *make* it work part comes in as you have to stretch that hanger pretty good to get it on, and you kind of have to do it, otherwise you'll need to get either a longer hanger, or find new attachment points and get a new hanger welded in. I elected to *make* it work because I didn't want the exhaust to hang any lower than it already does. As a result, the exhaust tip is in direct contact with the metal piece that is welded in place to go over the muffler. Its pretty tight so I'm not real worried about it rattling, but still. I may slide a piece of rubber in there just to make me feel better about it.My last gripe is that on the passenger side, the hitch contacts the underside of the bumper causing it to deform slightly. The plastic is fairly resiliant so you won't notice unless you get under the car and look at it, but the fix would be to either cut a little chunk out of the bumper, or cut one out of the hitch. I'm leaning towards the hitch since the only thing I'll ever be towing is my bike rack, but I don't know how crucial that part of the bracket would be if I were going to put a real load on it. Probably not a problem, but maybe...I give it 3 stars because even if I had the stock exhaust (or no exhaust for that matter), I don't like that it hits the bumper and that box on the passenger side. I have no qualms about the build quality of the hitch, it looks strong and whatnot, but a little more testing could have gone into it. I'm pretty sure the rear bumper between the STi, WRX and normal Impreza of that year are the same (google image search is failing me...) which means that more than likely they'll all have this problem. Aside from that, the mounting holes line up fine and I'm sure that the 200lb tongue weight limit is a very conservative estimate."

I was shipped the wrong item (a bug deflector, not the tonneau cover I ordered) which I had to return, but was never contacted about getting the tonneau when the shipping error was realized - as was promised I would.I finally stopped waiting and purchased a Lund Genesis tonneau cover from truckaddons.com - and got a better product for a lower price.I gave it three stars because I've had an Extang tonneau in the past and liked it - which was why I ordered another one."
91224,0,"These lift supports work, but I'd expect that from any brand. I'd be shocked if any manufacturer made supports that didn't do their job when new. Normally I'd give a product four stars if it did what I expect, but I expected slightly more so I'm indifferent at best.Installing these is not difficult. I've done it before and had the necessary tools. The manufacturer even says that no special tools are needed but the first review I read said that you'd need a Torx T40 socket. That reviewer didn't have one, and I'd bet most people with a basic set of tools won't have one either.It shouldn't be a big deal to read the instructions and figure out what tools to get, but there were no instructions. I bought two of these and neither box had instructions. Not everybody wants to buy an entire Torx socket set (I would not recommend an Allen wrench style L shaped driver) so I wouldn't consider telling customers what they need trivial.You might think that these would be easy enough for anybody to install without instructions, so none would be needed. As I said, I've done it before. So I knew when the uncompressed strut was about an inch longer than the maximum that my tailgate would open, and there was no way to compress them to get them to fit, that I'd have to disconnect the motor arm that opens and closes the lift gate. But if you don't understand why they don't fit, you might strip the threads trying to force these in.Even if you still consider all this trivial, I still think it would be nice to have a phone number for customer support, and have warranty information. Sometimes things go wrong with products, and a company address or phone number don't seem like much to ask for. Perhaps you don't care for pages of warnings telling you to prop the door open or it might fall on your head, or perhaps falling on your head is the reason you are changing these in the first place. But I can't buy a hair dryer these days without pages of warnings telling me not to use it while asleep, as well as giving me basic instructions. I think it's reasonable to tell users the basic steps needed to install these safely. If these fail after 60 days, is there even a warranty?Overall, these are not difficult to install, especially if you don't have a motorized lift gate. If you do, you disconnect it using the same Torx socket. You prop the door open, unscrew each end of the old struts, and screw the new ones in. The result is a new set of working struts that at least for now seem no better or worse than any other brand. Perhaps in 5-10 years I will decide that these are somehow superior. But if the manufacturer truly felt so, they would guarantee it."
60631,2,"Because it's so cheap, and the only match I could find, I'll probably buy another one but wouldn't recommend it. The thing broke in less than a week making it impossible to open the tailgate without pushing on one of the release bars with a screwdriver.The only thing I will say that is not included in description, yes it does come with the lock and keys and hardware; crappy picture shown for a crappy product."
161908,2,"I was VERY disappointed with this product. It didn't offer much shade at all from the sun coming through the back window. In fact, my husband and I agreed that there was only a slight difference between having it up or not. Additionally, the suction cups absolutely didn't hold."
102319,2,"Meguiar's products are definitely great products, but i wasnt too happy with this tire spray . It doesnt have the high gloss like some of the other products ive used."
113909,0,If you have the mirror mounted back up camera system this shade takes a little extra effort to place in the window. Other than that works great.
33976,1,"so far so good. bought this cushion for my parents backseat. they have factory heated seats in the front, but for the one who sits in the back it was chilly. not anymore. do wish that the plug in had a toggle switch for on/off instead of having to pull the plug from the outlet."

2621,1,Use this type of connector for fish finder power wiring connections on a kayak. This one is great - waterproof enough and easy to wire up due to the color coding - sometimes it is tough to keep things straight. These a inexpensive enough to use more than one to make my wiring modular and easy to change.
48851,2,"I bought this and have used it less than 5 times when something inside popped. I took the unit apart, and it appears as if an internal fuse has blown, which (of course) is non-replaceable.

21634,2,"These gloves fit very well and are comfortable. However, they look better and more durable in the pictures, which is kind of misleading. They are very thin and flimsy, and I do not trust that they'd hold up in a crash. For shorty gloves they aren't bad though if you only do slow speed in town riding. It's been 3 months and some of the stitching is sticking up, and I'm really hoping that it doesn't come apart. Honestly, I wish I had paid a bit more and gotten better full gauntlet gloves. If you just want some comfortable gloves, these are it. If you are looking for protection, then keep on looking.edit: it's been about 4 months now, 2000 miles of riding and these gloves are falling apart. the velcro stitching is coming undone. gloves look nice, but are not durable. get something else."

103352,1,These tools paid for them selves with the first use. Good quality but stick to cars and small trucks or you might have problems. Wish I had them when I rebuilt the front end of my Chevy S-10. I will never touch a pickel fork again!
22326,1,"This is a pretty good product. It is tough with cargo mats as most of them are not exactly what you hoped for but it works well. I particularly like the upturned edges that keep water and snow and whatever else on the liner, instead of allowing it to run off the edges onto the carpet.The Husky liner fits pretty well, although it has a bit of trouble relaxing into the depressed areas of the trunk because the fit is not absolutely perfect."
103874,0,I ordered this for our motor-home. The oak countertop is beautiful but it arrived without the hardware to install it. I did not want to return it as we loved the oak but I will have to buy some hardware which is a little annoying

157089,0,"For any serious detailer, this product is not for you. The science itself works - the water does sheet off the car, and it will dry without spotting if directions are followed to the letter. The achilles heel of the system is the barely detectable trickle of water that comes out of the unit when you try to rinse the car. Because it is filtered water, the output pressure is barely above zero, and it probably took me about 20 minutes to rinse off my SUV adequately.In that amount of time I could have easily dried the car by hand twice. This means blowing the car dry with my leaf blower (takes 5 minutes), then finishing with a light spray of quick detailer to remove any early spotting (another 5 minutes).If you have one car and you don't mind taking LONGER to get it done, then this product is for you. Perhaps if you're retired with nothing to do for a day, you don't mind waiting LONGER before you can apply your sealant, you don't mind being stuck with the Mr. Clean shampoo, and if you just want to sit back in a lawn chair with a beer, to enjoy watching the car dry spotlessly, then this will suit your needs.If you are truly in a hurry, and want to move fast, then this is not for you. You'd do much better to blow the car off with a leaf blower, and dry the few remaining drops by hand. See [...] - Corvette section - detailing. Also, if you prefer to use Zaino shampoo or Duragloss (my favorites), or other name brand, then you won't like this . In order to get the spotless dry without wiping, you really need to use the Mr. Clean shampoo. These are all reasons that I do not think any pro detailers would use this.If you're still interested in a spotless dry, without wiping, then check out the industry standard, CRspotless - easily located with a web search."
184278,0,I purchased this item. In the description it stated it was of high quality and had been powder coated and great black paint!Well i got package on time well wrapped but missing a nut and bolt the bag had been opened and it removed so i got 2 plates 5 nuts 5 bolts item to install needs 6 of each also no lock washers or shims in the package.The item was taped and partially wrapped in cardboard to help protect it! In removing the protection the paint aka powercoat and rust protection flaked chipped and fell off almost half the item I wrote to seller asked for the bolts and stated I need to install and use this item due to having to move a trailer that i had to go out prime/ protect and repaint whole unit and would like to at least get some return of money or reduction in billing been few days have have zero responce !Comeone at least discount the money for me to fix this and send me the proper parts in a timely fashion!contact me and provide a time solution?Buyer beware do not use this vender!!!!!!Been days still no response
36344,0,"Purchased this item for a 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT. Got the shipment 2 days ahead of time! Great service!!! However the reason for just 3 stars -->> The cover does not sit flush with light and finding alignment to secure was difficult due to the machined holes don't exactly line up to the factory light. After fiddling with it for awhile, I was able to get the provided longer screws in place but on slight angle in each hole. Kinda iffy, but it worked. Looking at it from the rear its pretty good looking. Side view, well again, its not flush and screws are visible. Oh, and its not quite level either. If you look careful enough from the rear, you see it drops down to the right slightly. Overall, besides the nit picking I'm doing, for an average Joe this should ok. But if your meticulous like myself, this $30 item may not be the one for your $35,000 truck. Hope this helps.JR in CT"
150732,2,"I often prefer to shop with Amazon when compared to other online alternatives, however for this item, I was quite disappointed that Amazon does not include an adequate description of the item. Specifically it is difficult to confirm exactly what is included with this purchase because the generic description provided for both the front and back seats. Since I wanted to only purchase front seats, it was too difficult to confirm which one to purchase, so I found it elsewhere online. Too bad, Amazon missed out on my business this time. The lack of a phone number to call and confirm product details also does not bode well for Amazon."

109316,1,"It's amazing how much junk is out there in this category of the tire guage market. Truely worthless junk, is mostly all you find now a days. It's like they assume everyone is so stupid they won't know any better either way so why make a proper working guage. Even other items from this same brand have not work very well for me in the past. With that said this one does seem to be a very decent product that actually performs as it should with repeated consistency.I understand some of the complaints from the others about the bleed feature, but I just basicaly use this bonus item to bring me close to my intended pressure before finally releasing the guage and manually resetting it and retesting it once I get closer to my mark for a final confirmation reading. The thing to remember and be realistic about here is that although you bleed the air at the the guage there is likely still some left in the line creating a slight off reading on the next go-round. Not a big deal or anything to be loosing you're hair over. It's going to be alright I promise"
142232,1,"This is a great panel to have, if you take good care of it. In full sunlight, it will put out the full 15 watts and is fully weatherproof. It is not heavy duty though, so you cant just have it somewhere it might slip, or have it angled up with the chance of it falling down--because it will break. And you can't fix the glass in it if you take it apart. Even when broken it still puts out the 15 watts, it just needs to be kept weather safe.I got it at Amazon's lowest price ever and I saw they went back up. But I would have already got another at that same price I got the first.This 15 watt panel is the perfect size to charge batteries without a controller."

54727,1,"They say pictures are worth a thousand words. View what it is looking like on my 1993 Bounder. Good luck with your application.Apr 6th.I want to add some additions to my previous comments. If you use a buffer, plan on doubling or tripling your order. I used a buffer on 1 side and discovered I was running out fast so I ordered more. I wanted to see how much I would save by applying by hand and it uses about half doing it by hand. I had to buy 2 sets for my 34 foot Bounder class A. You will have an over abundance of the third step the final wax but the nice thing is, you will be applying it 2-3 times per year and you will have plenty to use.Step #1 is more difficult by hand but I reached the same result by hand as my Makita orbital. The time that you take to use the orbital is 6's because of tiresome hoofing it around and applying so often. I felt like i got a more even application when I did it by hand.Step #2 seems useless because of what the first application does but it does make sense to polish after you just deoxidized. It is not too noticeable by view but the touch is a difference. It's like it adds a gel coat back to the oxidization you just peeled off. It looks just beautiful.Step #3 goes on so smooth and polishes off nicely. Smells good too... :)...I was totally impressed, that's why I gave it 5 Stars.The Fiberglass loves it...Good luck to you..."

That was not a big deal for me because the harness wiring had some slack so it could have reached. My problem is that the diameter of the bulb base itself is larger than the original 9006 bulb so it could not fit in the bulb holder... Buyers ensure that the entire model number is compatible with your car! Not all 9006 bulbs are the same size..

As if that wasn't enough, the gauges held up my whole shipment for a couple of weeks and in the end shipped separately anyway. Lots of stores carry these and are usually cheaper than Amazon, so save yourself the trouble. If you need the full retail display, I would suggest leaving Amazon completely out of the equation.P.S. I hate reviews of sellers in place of product reviews as much as the next guy, but this is a special case.

157431,2,"I have owned the ratchet for almost 8 months and used it on a daily basis and have had nothing but problems with the ratchet randomly not working. The battery is charged, but it seems to have a problem with the switch that activates the motor. I disassembled the unit to have a look at the switch and possibly install a new one only to find that the switch is soldered to a circuit board. So its not a simple switch replacement. The ratchet is fantastic and a real time saver when it works. but overall a total waste of time when you need to use the ratchet and it stops working while your in the middle of an assembly job and have to stop and dig out other tools to finish your work. I have read on many other tool websites about customer complaints that the tool just stops working. It's a real shame the tool just lays down and dies. I would say i have used the ratchet enough to have paid for the original cost, but I won't be purchasing another skil ratchet any time soon."

106965,0,"This waxer works fine and it's great to do the work cordless. There is a cigarette lighter adapter also. I did not purchase it from Amazon, although that was possibly a mistake. I did purchase extra bonnets from Amazon because the two supplied are not enough. The place I purchased it from no longer carries it. My waxer came with 2 batteries, one of which was defective. Since the retailer no longer carries it, I can only return it for a refund and can't replace the defective battery. When I called Waxmaster customer service, they refused to honor the warranty (supposedly 3 years). They said that they don't carry replacement batteries because it's not worth it to do so. They recommended I return it for a refund if the retailer will take it back. I bought it just a month ago. So, the product works fine while it works, but don't expect any customer service. The 3-year warranty is a joke and a lie. I'm glad I found out now. I wish I'd bought it from Amazon. At least then I could return it to get a working battery.

180380,0,Mirrors work as advertised. But they are pretty ugly and will cover the reflector on the front of the mirror. The mirror is pretty small compared to the amount they extend. I decided to install the factory towing mirrors instead and prefer them to the add ons.
77985,2,"Bought a set of these for my Jag XJS. They were purported to be custom cut but they do not fit the foot well and have to have folds along the edges and are not fitted like originals are.Trying to make contact to anyone that cares or could do anything is impossible.Will be returning these and will get a proper set.I wonder if any other vehicles have the same issues, but seems that for my Jag, their template was off."
142458,0,"Aerospace 303 protectant very good but too pricey. I purchased for use on a hot tub cover. i must admit, it appears to do a great job at restoring and protecting. I just found the gallon jug at over $60 to be very expensive. I feel that i could have gotten similar results from a gallon of armor all for half the price. I probably won't buy again but that decision is purely based on cost. If i could find for $30-40 bucks then i would probably buy again."
48459,1,"I am quite happy with this gadget.It took a while to get familiar with it, but after that it works great. It takes me about 10 minutes, once a week, to make sure that both my cars are properly inflated. Definitely one of my more worthwhile purchases.The only issue I have with this is the crude dial setting - between 30 and 40 psi that I need, there are no markings and it requires some guesswork and trial/error. It is not a show stopper though."
120143,2,It is not the right one for my Vehicle. It said on the ad that it fit my 2002 Vue but it doesn't.

53054,1,"I did a lot of forum reading about Redline Shcokproof Heavy.As others have said, it just plain works!I put it in my 2004 Fatboy with over 21,000 miles and had instantly smoother shifts and easier neutral from both directions.This stuff is thick and coats very well."
120524,0,"I purchased this cover in July for my 1974 Chevy Nova which I have not begun restoration on. I was very excited when I recieved it. It fit well, seemed to be crafted well, and secured easily with a small bungee cord thru the reinforced center holes. I thought it would buy me enough time to finish my current project. In September I noticed a very small hole near the driver side headlight, and thought to myself 'Oh well, its still holding up well for the price'. I sewed on a small patch and went on my merry way. By late November the cover was falling apart like a wet paper towel. I am still a month away from finishing my current project and starting the Nova and still haven't taken the cover off once. Initial quality seemed fairly high for the price but now I am left wanting, out $60 and a cover."
70160,0,"Bought this cause I heard that it can lower the operating temp of your cooling system by 10%. I noticed no differece in the temp range, but I also havent had any downsides to putting it in either. Id say its a wash."
150057,1,"I bought this for a huge stain located in the passenger seat of my car. I had to use multiple applications becuase it sort of spread the stain a little at first, but eventually it removed it completely. I also used it for stains on my bedroom floor and it did as good of of a job at removing 90% of those stains as well."
184099,2,"Lock shaft is 1/8 inch short of fitting the receiver on my 2010 Tacoma. Thought it was the rubber casing preventing the shaft from passing through the receiver with enough room on the end for the lock, so I cut off the casing. All that did was make it so I couldn't return the lock. Hate it when products are not as advertised."
90954,1,If you need an old school mechanical fuel pump...this one is much better than the odd-ball units available at most local parts stores. Everything about it looked much better and it's now installed and working great.
74651,2,I received this item in a firm plastic sleeve that might have been opened previously. The wiper inside was dirty. The other blade I ordered (same one in a different size) was in even worse condition. These are going right back to the sender.
86024,2,I Bought These filters for a 2002 Suzuki 800 Marauder VZ-800.They Do Not Fit. You can not put high flow filters on this bike. I strugled for mounths trying to adjust the carb but it was imposable. Finaly I had to spend more money and buy OEM filters. Don't wast your money If You have a Suzuki VZ-800.

91805,0,"This wiper fit my 2005 Ford Escape but not very securely. The spring pressure keeps the blade in, but it would be better if it clicked in and locked."
137508,0,I've purchased these leather covers over the last 12 years. I've noticed the quality of leather that is used seems to have gone down. The first one I bought was very close to Italian leather; the last two did not have the same buttery soft leather. I've also noticed that price is significantly more than the first one I purchased....which would be understandable if the quality was the same.
156270,1,"This product meets my expectations, the only minor glitch is the height, wishit was 2 inches less so it would look tighter, or you have to put the holesfor the pins all the way to the top edge, so there won't be any slack onFord F-150 Bed, other then that, thumps up, find a good price between $30.00to $40.00 dollars and you got a good deal, Yes I recommend, had two monthsno problems..A BUTT EYE REVIEW."
154594,1,"When I ordered these blades, I thought there were two to a package. NO! Note there is only one wiper blade per package!"
131624,2,"Overall quality is good, but definitely not a dump cart. I bought this to haul behind the ATV to pick up manure and the last thing I want to do after shoveling it into the cart is to have to shovel it out. My husband had to put a different latch on it because the original did not hold up. Nothing worse than going down the lane and having the damn thing let go with a full load. He also raised it up on the frame 4 inches so it would dump better. It helped, but the scoop design on the back just holds everything in unless I back it up so the thing hangs over a hill.It may work for firewood and other general chores, but it is not at all user friendly around a farm being used for what I bought it for."
102469,0,"These gloves simply didn't fit my hands at all. I tried two different sizes. The large size was too short in finger length & hand/palm coverage. the wrist strap connector was too low on my wrist. The XL size was waaay too big to fit snugly on my hand, though the finger length was adequate. The connection at the wrist was too large for my hands and don't allow the gloves to fit comfortably at all. My hands are constantly slipping inside the glove. I've never had a pair of gloves that simply don't fit no matter what size I chose. I like the looks & the feel/texture of the glove, but they are not very practical in terms of fit, grip or comfort."
119622,1,Bought this for my Sears Lawn Tractor. It's a spark plug - it sparks and starts the engine and keeps it running smoothly. Highly recommend!
89877,1,"This cover is nice once you get it on your wheel, but it is so tight that it's extremely hard to get on. It is stiff, not like one of the cloth ones that you stretch over your wheel, which makes it that much harder because you do have to stretch it and it resists."
72175,2,Not what I expected from what I heard on link to YouTube. I wanted a LOUD horn for my motorcycle to get other driver's attention when they are too busy TEXTING or too busy fumbling w/ their phone. This was about equal to what I already have. I bought a BadBoy air horn locally and it does the trick.
44047,1,"It was very hard to find an affordable rack for a BMW on the market. After some time researching I came across this rack, which does what it supposed to do. Good quality and great price. I used to transport snowboards from Texas to Colorado back and forth.Great product from a great brand!"
8063,0,"Dont get me wrong, the lights are nice.. Just not what I was expecting. I wanted my parking lights to be brighter than the stock set of bulds. These were not. They are no brighter than the stock lights when the turn signal is not on. They are a little deeper orange than the stock one and are somewhat brighter when the turn signal is on."
187107,2,"The first time I used the tool the glue on the knob failed and, instead of loosening the clamp to remove the whole thing, the knob just came right off. That left the tool stuck on the caliper. Luckily I was able to remove it with some pliers, but having to deal with the stress of the tool breaking on my first brake pad replacement was something I didn't need."
96073,2,"I have been installing (and installing and installing...) this lamp in my 2000 F250XL 4x4 for 3 or 4 years. I have analyzed the problem upsidedown and backwards. I have no voltage spikes, overvoltage or any other conceivable electrical issue that would contribute to reduced life. I can get about 4 months max out of the low beam afterwhich I operate on high beams aimed a hair low just to get some value out of the purchase. Local prices are awful but I see online pricing is much better. I have polled other owners but no one has these lamps, nor have they experienced premature burnout. I expect to leave the 6054 on the shelf in the future in favor of any alternative I can find."
179800,2,After two years of use there are holes/rips in the material even where there is no apparent stress points (front center of hood near window and sides by door windows). It is not water-proof and the material even when new is susceptible to rips and tears if pulled too hard. I need to have it replaced and I cannot recommend this product.
109190,2,"NO...... I cannot support the use of this product given how most users interpret it's intended use!The kit description does use the word ""Winterizer""! We associate ""winterize"" with freeze protection.In my opinion, the manufacturer would be wise to provide full disclosure and details that fully explain the Raw Water cooled I/O and I/B engine T-stat housing, the sea water ""by-pass"" porting, and explain to the user that most all sea water is being directed towards and out the exhaust system. (sea water = antifreeze when the kits are being used)Otherwise, the user may inadvertantly believe that his/her engine will be filled with ""un-diluted"" antifreeze, and that their engine will be protected against freeze damage.Let me explain:With any Raw Water Cooled Marine I/B or I/O engine, only a portion of the supplied sea water is required for actual engine cooling demands, compared to that which a sea water pump is capable of supplying (for both engine and exhaust demands).The ""porting"" within the T-stat housing allows for a proportunate division of sea water..... The engine circulating pump charges the engine block with the amount of coolant (sea water) required via T-stat's open position..... The greater balance of coolant (sea water) is being sent to and out the exhaust system.In simple terms; this means that more sea water (antifreeze when the kit is used) is being sent to and out the exhaust system, compared to what actually enters the engine block/heads (until we reach engine loads that require greater cooling demands).This is pretty much the case with any Raw Water Cooled I/O or I/B marine engine.The warming up of the engine in order for the thermostat to open prior, is somewhat of a misnomer.... and in particular when these kits are introducing the antifreeze during low RPM and no engine loads.Now we connect up the Camco Kit antifreeze container:Again...... only a portion of the limited 4-5 gallons of Camco Kit antifreeze actually makes it's way into the engine cooling system during this rather short duration.The greater portion of the Camco Kit antifreeze is going right on out the exhaust system (just as the sea water does)!The user must understand that when he or she sees antifreeze exit the exhaust, this is NOT an indicator that un-diluted antifreeze made it's way into and out of the engine block/heads.If not educated, the user is left with a ""False-Positive"", so to speak!By the time he or she finishes up, any Camco Kit antifreeze that DID make it into the engine, may have now become diluted by the residual engine block sea water.If we begin with a completely drained engine block, the liklihood of antifreeze dilution is reduced.These kits are intrinsically an OK idea if in the hands of a professional Marine Mechanic. The Marine Mechanic will likely drain everything afterwards anyway.However, in the wrong hands, and when the user is lacking the understanding of the above info, it can leave them with freeze damage come spring time.For those who insist on using these kits, probe your drain ports and drain completely afterwards, and you should be OK.OEM service manuals will always suggest to completely drain engine components of all sea water during the winterizing procedure.The need for the rust inhibiting properties of antifreeze (during the lay up) are greatly exaggerated, IMO. The amount of rust/corrosion that could occur during the lay up are paled by comparison to that which occurs during the normal season's usage.If you're after that ""feel good"" feeling, then do it, but drain again afterwards.Otherwise, winterize according to your OEM manual.Remember.... just plain air will not freeze, expand, and crack our expensive cast iron components."

55638,0,"These look really thick and cool under my hood.As far as performance is concerned, they actually have quite a bit more resistance than the CSK Nascar wires I took off with 35k miles. They also had more resistance than some stock Toyota wires that had 100+k on them and had been in a box in the shed for years. That being said, I didn't actually notice any decline in performance, and since I really liked the looks, I let them stay.I don't get any ignition noise in my radio or cell phone, so that's a plus for them."

6532,2,"The spark plugs were the correct size; however, they were missing the top piece that allows the plugs to better fit into the wiring harness. I had to purchase different spark plugs to obtain the necessary top pieces to fit the wiring harness."
183433,1,The gloves fit great. My only complaint is that my finger nails which I just cut back to nothing get stuck on the seam inside the fingers. I had a friend try them on as well and he had the same problem. Other than that which I think I can get used to I love them. The titanium plates make it look very agressive. I ride in Texas and my hand has not sweat yet in our 90 degree weather.
39677,0,"I like having a tire gauge and I like having one that fits on a key chain but it is small and delicate for getting a good reading quickly. The end must be matched up flush to avoid air escaping and I am left wondering if an ""O"" ring or other gasket is missing from the unit... other traditional gauges I've used suffer similar problems... hard to read at night or with even modest vision impairments."
133961,0,"good quality and adhesivness, but the letters are as wide are they are tall. it makes the 2 inch letters look alot bigger than they should."
83511,1,"This product works very well provided that you have somewhat of a machined surface that you are mating together. If your parts are made of stamped out sheet metal and have some curvature, then red silicone works better. Gasket Maker is superior to fiber based gaskets because it never does get hard and brittle, which causes leaks. Will not work on exhaust related components. Clean surfaces are important in all cases."
1450,0,"It' came out of the box damaged because it so heavy the bottom has a bulge in it. The end caps for the wheels were missing and had to go to home depot for the parts. Once assembled, it looks fine. I've not had the chance to use it yet so I just hope it works. I just hope the company will stand behind the product if it fails to charge or operate as intended. They need to find a better packaging system to protect their product for transport.Regards,Tim Terlecky"
82494,1,Great quality!!! In OEM packaging!!!! Fast Shipping!!!!Buy multiple items because it is a good deal and they are not that easy to find localaly
110830,1,I prefer this product over the spray as it gives you more control over the distibution. Works well and is easy to use.
146254,1,"I originally bought a ""Jeep"" all weather radio for my husband for Christmas - I thought paying more might mean a better product; not so, the hand crank broke on 2nd use. I then ordered this one - my hubby loves it. It contains everything we would want for an emergency radio; we have no problems picking up any of the t.v., National or local stations. The light is sufficient for an emergency and the Alert would definitely get you out of bed. The only issue we have seen is that we had it on one night and the alarm went off for no apparant reason...If not for that I would have given it 5 stars. I think this is a must for any household that lives in a storm prone area (which seems to be just about anywhere now a days): I definitely feel comfortable going to bed if severe storms are predicted using this radio rather than spending the entire night watching the t.v. which is what I always did in the past...A good buy in my book."
162614,0,"This was a gift for my 1977 Olds 88-the cover is actually a bit on the bigger size-perhaps designed for the pre-1977 models? Once the wind gets underneath it, it's off. The grommets should help-I've got some plastic one-gallon water jugs saved up so that should help weigh it down. There are better covers out there, but then you're getting into hundreds of dollars. If you've got a paint job to be concerned over-go for the more expensive covers. Nothing will stop the ocean air though. Not even a garage!"
126460,1,I took a gamble and ordered the low cost door actuator.This gamble could not of turned out better. The part supplied options for a perfect fit.This was over a year ago and the actuator is still going strong.
27723,2,This doesn't fit my 2003 Jaguar S-type even though they say it should. I tried to put it in too late to get a refund. Beware.
68314,0,"I expected something a bit heavier. Maybe it could break automotive glass, but it doesn't seem heavy enough to do the job. The handle doesn't have the length to give extra wallop to the swing of the hammer either. Unfortunately, I can hardly test it...unless someone will donate a car window to me. Hopefully, I'll never have to use it for real.On the other hand, delivery time was phenomenal. I didn't pay extra for express delivery. Regardless, I had the product within three days. And, the seatbelt cutter recessed in the structure is much safer than scissors flying everywhere out of the door storage if you should find yourself in a roll-over and the belt won't release."
97893,2,"I bought these less than a month ago for my Plymouth Voyager, first of all one size fits all doesn't seem to apply to these, they are too big for my seat and are always slipping off. Secondly the seam is ripping on both of them already. They are pretty don't get me wrong but for what we pay for these things they should last more than a month."
40608,2,This product is a waste money. All the little air bubble will flatten out and be useless. All in all it's just a piece of junk and not worth buying. I might take it if someone gave it too me.
131967,1,"Although the manufacturer's web site doesn't state that it fits a Honda Nigthawk 250, with some work it can be done. Simply use a half inch drill bit to enlarge the opening of the semi-circle slot on each bracket, do so at the extreme lower end of the slot. Use this newly enlarged hole and your own headlinght mount bolt and it works very well. The overall product is well made, the brackets are stout and the shield itself looks great on the bike. As a a previous reviewer noted, it's not going to take all the wind off of you, I'm 6'1"" and I set the fairing at a pretty raked angle and I feel the wind at my shoulders and helmet. If you raise the shield more vertically you do get a lot of extra wind noise - almost a roar. I have it dialed in just right for me and it makes freeway handling much more enjoyable."

179275,2,"So I ordered this brush because of its pretty pink color. When it arrived in the mail...it was black. I did not order black, i am still mad about this. Obviously if I wanted a black brush I would have ordered a black one. I would suggest not ordering this if you want a pink brush. Im sure it is a good product, I was just very upset."
124244,1,"I used this in the automatic transmission of my 1996 Honda Prelude as per the recommendation of this seller. I couldn't be more pleased with the result. The car was shifting poorly, lurching and hesitating, not surprising given the 160K miles and lack of maintainance of the previous owner, but it immediately shifted almost perfectly as soon as I drove it after ""Xadoing"" it.I was told to use two tubes but only used one.The gel did not mix well with the ATF in the bottle so... believe it or not... I nuked a small amount in my microwave oven (for one minute) and added it into the bottle with the Xado gel which solved that little challenge.I highly recommend this."
176468,2,bought spark plugs with the promise of a rebate or refund with each one. so far have not recieved a rebate
132950,2,"I have owned this unit for 14 months and used it fairly often. The unit looks very good and feels solid. However, all the voltage setting were the same for AGM, Wet and Gel,... and they were too high at 15.1 volts while the recommended voltages on batteries were either 14,4 or 14,8,.. there is no ability to adjust,.. this would probably be even worse for Gel Cells. These AGM and Gell batteries are very sensitive to voltage, as the electrolyte can be dried up by over heating.After about 6 months of use, the cooling fan started making a horrible noise and the vibrations keep it from running at top speed.Now, in the past week the top charging voltage has dropped from 15.1 to 12.9 when set to 10 amps and 13.5v when set to 40 amps. This is not enough to fully charge the Battery before the charger turns off and says that the battery is ""Full.""Perhaps I have a defective unit from the start,.. but this has been very frustrating."
107931,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
82823,2,Claim to fit a 97 Accord EX sedan but be careful it doesn't. To late to return for me which is totally my fault.
97387,0,The quality of components for this kit is very good. Installation instructions had one error. When wired per the instructions/diagram the unlock button actually locked the doors. Operation was reversed for lock/unlock. Reversing two wires resolved the problem. Most door lock remotes have the buttons recessed so they aren't pressed accidentally and also when buttons are pressed on factory remotes there is a small delay before the doors lock or unlock. This helps to prevent accidental activation of the remote for short mometary accidental presses of the buttons on the remote such as when inside pants pockets. This remote does not have this delay so if a button is pressed accidentally while you are away from your vehicle the doors may actually unlock without your knowledge. The range of the remote is not very far so you will likely notice that the doors were unlocked since the lights will flash but it really should not be so easy to accidentally activate the remote. The two significant changes that should be made to this kit is to recess the remote buttons so they aren't so easily pressed accidentally and add a short delay after pressing a button for the doors to lock/unlock so if there is an accidental momentary press of a button it doesn't unlock your doors while you are away from your car.
117956,1,"This Brute Force intake is the best bang for the buck, Amazon was the cheapest and quick ship.Installed this on an 06 Nissan Titan, fit great and looks awesome."
65018,1,bought this for a customer.... he cut it to his liking but other than that i was a nice piece.. (i have UFO plastics on my CR500 and like them A LOT)
159649,0,"First off, the final result is worth everything I put into it. My steering wheel was looking worn and gross and I don't like how thick a standard steering wheel cover feels. It took a long time to lace it up and it was very rough on my hands. The worst part was not pushing the needle it was pulling the lace tight. I ended up giving myself a small rope burn like thing on my fingers. After a couple hours I had to stop to rest my hands and when I went to finish I used gloves but it was definitely harder to get the holes wearing gloves. The leather isn't the best quality ever but I like it. It has a coarse grain to it and is pretty heavy and rough but it matches the rest of my steering wheel almost perfectly. The only thing that isn't quite right is the lacing; it doesn't quite match but it's alright. My only suggestions for anybody buying this item would be, have pliers, wear a pair of gloves like mechanics gloves or riding gloves, and keep a good count on the holes as you go over any spokes so that you don't have an uneven number of holes at the end."
135150,0,"I bought this for siphoning old gas before storing various engines. It works well enough for equipment with larger fuel tanks like a riding lawnmower or motorcycle but is pretty much useless for smaller tanks like pushmowers or snowthrowers as the siphon requires a good 4""+ in vertical liquid height in order to provide enough pressure from shaking to start the siphon."
131412,1,"I have had this helmet for awhile now and can offer an accurate opinion. My medium fits me perfect. It is snug but not too tight, although until broken in it is more snug than later. If you are touring and will be taking this helmet off all day, your ears may get rubbed somewhat raw.(the back of my ears do) This helmet is very quiet, although I almost always wear ear plugs. I installed a NOJ Quiet Rider fabric insert on the bottom of the helmet and it really makes a helmet much quieter. I had one on my last helmet also, took it off once while on a trip, put it back on before I went 10 miles. This helmet is also very light; in fact, it is one of the lightest helmets available. I have a white one because I think a white helmet or one with a primary color (red, blue, yellow etc.) is more easily seen by others, especially at night or under dim conditions. The ventilation is good, not great, but decent enough and I live in the Phoenix area. The faceshield is one of the best out there. It is easy to remove and install, is nice and thick with good clarity, and operates smoothly. Compare the faceshield to a different brand helmet and you will see what I mean. This helmet is also priced well, as I consider it a premium lid. Oh, it also looks nice and has a clean aero shape."
75578,0,"Bought this for a 1982 Yamaha 650 Seca. Fits properly, but wish it came pre-oiled like other K&N filters. The informational sheet says to use 3/4 of the oil packet, but following K&N's directions to oil every crease, I easily used the entire tube."
11482,2,"DO NOT waste your money on these pricey bulbs. Mine lasted about 6 months. My original equipment bulbs were still working after 5 years but were not that bright so I decided, unwisely as it turned out, to replace with these brighter bulbs. On the back of the pack it says they do not last as much as 4 times as long. They were right. Save your money and buy the regular bulbs unless you have a lot of time to spend changing them every six months."

118078,1,This product works as advertised. I started with the single battery tender and it worked so well! I bought two more dual bank battery tenders for my bass boat and saltwater boat. Excellent product would and have recommended to many other people! You can not go wrong with this product!

52870,0,"This scanner (KIT) reads both OBD1 and OBD2 systems. It helps alot with troubleshooting emisions systems and controls. It also reads out data on systems with the engine running,O2 sensor, T.P.S.,coolant,rich or lean fuel injector setting and more.

88871,0,"I have the Magic Shades in the super jumbo size, and I received the grey material that is somewhat sparkly but certainly not highly reflective mylar material. The black side seems to be very hot to me when I get in the car, and the ""shaded"" dashboard also just seems to radiate heat back in my face. Granted I am in Texas, but I am fairly certain that my old accordion-style sunshade, which was green tinted mylar, did a better job of deflecting the heat away from the car interior. I've been using these about 4 months and so far so good on them staying in one piece and in my ability to fold it now, by twisting my wrists! The kids have fun and laugh, trying to fold them up in the back seat!"
27590,1,"My son bought an Auto x ray 6000 about 10 years ago. I don't understand all the negativity about this thing. His unit has performed flawlessly on everything we have tried it on. Well, except my 95 Geo Tracker. Only Suzuki dealers are privy to this car. (Good luck finding one) Anyway, it has diagnosed EVERY car we have used it on for 10 years without a hitch. If it fails the next time, it won't matter, because it has paid for itself many times over. We have never used factory support, we have never had a problem. I need to buy a scan tool for myself now, but, am confused with all this bad hype out there. I realise, this is not a high end unit, but Snap-on, Genisys, and others are no better for much more money. I see many Snap-on scan tool owners crying about their $5000 units not working, or, not being upgradeable. It's a tool, and tools must constantly be bought as old ones become obsolete, or get broken."
96619,0,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
19306,0,"These gloves simply didn't fit my hands at all. I tried two different sizes. The large size was too short in finger length & hand/palm coverage. the wrist strap connector was too low on my wrist. The XL size was waaay too big to fit snugly on my hand, though the finger length was adequate. The connection at the wrist was too large for my hands and don't allow the gloves to fit comfortably at all. My hands are constantly slipping inside the glove. I've never had a pair of gloves that simply don't fit no matter what size I chose. I like the looks & the feel/texture of the glove, but they are not very practical in terms of fit, grip or comfort."

181468,0,"Bought this to try out because Royal Purple gets such rave reviews. There are two 20W50 formulas from Royal Purple, but I had a hard time discerning what the difference actually is, so I got this one (cheaper). Compared to Mobil 1 20W50, my motorcycle runs hotter and the valve train makes more noise. After about 2500 mi., I drained it out and put Mobil 1 back in. Much better. Also, the oil causes the engine to produce a ""sweet"" smell. This is normal according to Royal Purple and due to its formula, but, mixed with exhaust, it smells awful. My bike doesn't burn oil... it's just the smell Royal Purple is associated with. I don't like it. Also, Royal Purple oil new is very dark (and dark purple). Mobil 1 is the standard synthetic light brown/amber color. At least I can tell with Mobil 1 that the oil is contaminated - it turns dark, not starts dark. Not a fan, and will use the rest of my bottles in the primary or hand it over to friends who are willing to trust it. I'm sure it's fine, but not for me."
52537,1,"it has been several years since I bought it and i am 100% satisfied. Product is still in its original shape and still same quality as when new. It has been used under rain and sun of South florida and had stand strong wings: still in very good shape! I recommend it 100%. Forgot to mention: I can use it on top of convertible top AND also when convertible top is down. So, its pretty convenience when you want to keep momentarily the top down under a tree, or for half a day, etc and will protect it from the environment."

I will probably just buy the normal air filters from now on and save the hassle of trying to clean this one every so often. You also have to wait a while for it to dry before putting it back in the vehicle, and I would rather just pop in a new air filter and go on about my business."

162130,0,"This product is great except the USB support stopped working. I used the device in several cars and the reception was quite good. There was a little hiss, but you can't hear it after you start the engine and my car is fairly quiet. It changes frequency at the lower end of the FM range so you can pick a spot where there is no interference. I found that the first spot was the best so I never had to adjust it. I used a preset on the FM radio so I could always jump to this frequency. This device is great for traveling when you rent a car.At first, I relied on the USB port to play mp3s from a 250MB flash drive, but this eventually stopped working. Now it plays for a few minutes, makes some strange noises and stops playing. I tried the same mp3s that I first played on it to no avail. So now I use it to broadcast an mp3 player. This still works."

31480,1,"This fit great in my 1999 Honda Accord, V6 3.0LI can tell there's increased power, but haven't seen a difference in fuel economy: it might even be lower due to more 'spirited' driving. The added power was the reason I bought it, so I'm very happy. It's also nice to know I'll never have to buy another air filter for this car. I've driven about 4,000 miles with the K&N; filter and haven't had any trouble with it."
178118,1,Fit my 2004 F-150 XLT Supercrew with 5.4L Triton. Very easy replacement with the quick disconnect tool (a must have). I was amazed at the gunk that came out of the old Motorcraft Fuel Filter. Obviously it was doing its job.
104699,1,I have a k & N air kit on both my cars and my Harley. I have never had a problem. I have increased horsepower and better gas mileage. Enough said.
168337,2,"I was very impressed by the design and materials of this tire-stepper. Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not tell you that it will not fit onto tires where the vehicle's wheel well design leaves little room around the tire. This means that my Honda Odyssey minivan and compact SUV Subaru Forester did not come close in allowing this stepper to fit. Yes, I could return it easily thanks to Amazon's fine customer policies, but I wish the manufacturer was much clearer in its representations about the specific vehicles their product would fit."

127967,1,I use these behind clear lenses in rear of my R1150R motorcycle as brake lights/turn signals with a Kisan Signalminder. They are as bright as the stock bulbs and don't produce any of the heat. Behind clear lenses they look great - highly recommended.Note: These do match the picture with the two surface mount LED's on the sides. There is another version of this same light using three regular LED's instead which adds additional length.
60484,0,I have a pretty large head. These look like kids goggles on me. There is no way for my eyeglasses to fit inside either. They seem to be built pretty well.

145211,2,"I Love Manik's products, they are very well made and well worth the money, but DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF IT IS BEING SOLD BY AUTOPARTS WAY. this company does nothing but lie, and is the most unreliable seller i have ever delt with on amazon. twice i tried to buy this grill guard and both times autopartsway canceled my order and never told me. i had to try to track it down, not easy with a company who doesn't even have a working published phone number, the only number you can find on thier web site is out of service. After the agravation i had durring the first order i almost didnt try again, it was only after being told the grill guard was instock i gave them one more chance. But once again the order was canceled. this time i was told that the order was canceled because that company doesn't carry that item, not only did they tel me before that i didnt get it because they were out of stock, then told it was in stock, but if you enter the item number into the company's website search engine, it will take you to a page where the company themself have it listed as a carried product. For whatever reason i could not leave sellerfeedback but you can see from others that have been able to that the company is not one you want to do business with. STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!!I ended up ordering the grill from another company while saving almost $100 from what these lossers are charging. dont be fooled like i was, be ware!!!"

Since the Protege5 has two O2 sensors- one before the catalytic converter, and one after- I decided to buy both of them. I debated whether to buy them from the dealer or from a local parts place. After finding them on Amazon, I'm glad I made the right choice. I saved over $100 and there was no soldering or splicing was needed and the wire / connector lengths were perfect.

I don't know what other people are smoking, or maybe since that review they changed something.It worked great for me on my Windshields, headlight lenses, and rear brake light lenses.As to whether it repels the rain, I have not really tested that yet. I just wanted to state it DID NOT film or streak at all for me. Infact, how well it did perform makes me dubious of the reviews that before me.EDIT: I've found that this product performs better on plastics than on real windshields. I would stick to Megiuars glass cleaner."

99826,0,"This dashmat is not an exact fit. Although it is contoured to much of the dash, it is too long in areas. This makes it buckle in certain spots. I have given it time to ""relax"" in the heat, and if the dashmat were cut to fit better, it would probably sit evenly across the dash. The problem is you can't trim the mat without cutting the binding on the border. If you did it would fray. Thus, an imperfect product that is fair at best. The Ultimat is a Dashmat product that is supposedly an exact fit to every vehicle, but it's not made for this car. I emailed the company to see why they don't offer their Ultimat for the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder. I was sent a very basic response that indicated to me that they just didn't care. I don't think I'd recommend this product or company."

Those skills belong to the armed forces, obviously.What are we going to do? Get rid of our military and simply send everybody to help out third world countries? Because, I assure you, sending our MOSTLY non-muslum citizens over to a Muslum country (no, this is not an attack on Muslums) where extremist Muslum terrorist organizations operate ... to try and ""volunteer"" and institute health, education, and environmental programs is NOT the way to fight terrorism.

52884,2,"My model didn't appear to come with the right cables -- the key power cable didn't look anything like the picture in the somewhat cryptic instructions, and as a consequence none of the adapters could be fitted to the solar charger.

I have a 15 gallon, and at 90 psi that is all it would last before the compressor kicked on to recharge the tank. If you do it this way you have to repeat this procedure over and over to get a max vacuum something large like a a/c system. All said and done all at best I could get it to go to -25psi. Specs say it can get to -29, but I don't believe it. Also like the other review said it has a cheap plastic cap to cover the r-12 port when it should have come with a metal one."

6633,1,"Once you've used these type of split-cable traction chains, you'll never use the traditional ones again. With traditional chains, you have to lay them out, move the vehicle, then fasten. The split front cable allows you to park the vehicle, whip the chains under and around the tire, fasten, then be on your way.The one downside to this, is that if there is heavy snow accumulation on the roadway, ""whipping"" the chains under and around the tire isn't the easiest, but typically, the tracks in the snow that you've just made by getting to the install site, are sufficient enough to provide a flat surface.We've used these type of chains for years now and have always been very happy with the performance. Keep in mind that our use has never been off-road. We are avid snowboarders and have used these traction cables on freeways/highways/roads traveling to and from ski areas - - - in other words, we've used them only on snow covered paved roads."

First with the tire, the opening is too small to get in because the blade can't be angled enough. After overcoming that, the blade doesn't lock into the wiper bar - tab too wide. Won't try this brand again."

The grab handle is the same length as the other strap, so there is really no loop to place your hand into. You have to wedge your hand in between the handle and the rollbar.It's a good price for what you get. When these get stolen, I'll probably buy the exact same ones again."
38695,1,The part was perfect. It was delivered rite on time. The part number was a perfect match and it was the best price around
72214,1,Fitment is perfect on my 2011 (gen 2).. I know the power-gain is probably not significant enough for me to notice but it seems a little faster coupled with a slip-on..Overall very satisfied with this air filter.
22593,1,"I had heard great things about the GranTour bag, so I decided to purchase one before a planned trip. Received the item in a timely manner and began to install it. I had to do a small modification to the hooker pad, as I have to mount under the pillion, but it was no big deal. I used the bag a couple of times with no problem, but on my third use, the buckle broke. I contacted the seller, along with a photo, and they promptly sent me a new buckle. After a week, so far so good. Bag holds more than I expected, which is always good. Comes with a rain cover, also good and the zippers appear to be heavy duty. The bag is stable, even with just the straps holding to the pad under the passenger pillion, and being fully loaded! Overall a great purchase, I just hope the buckles hold up."
153504,1,"This is a negative battery cable, not positive as the picture shows. The secondary lead is the correct gage, not like what you would get at your local auto parts shop. Be very careful and use 2 wrenches when removing the block end. There are 2 wires with very short leads behind the battery cable on the same stud and if they turn at all, it will break the terminal and there is very little room to put a new one on and make it reach the stud."
153163,1,I received the dashmat and unrolled it for the night. It fit very well and looks great. I needed more velcro strips than came with it to hold it in place. If the company could supply a few more strips it would be a great product.

Paid for overnight shipping (3.99 for prime members!) and it came the next day despite saying it takes 1-2 days to process. As with the other review, the box it comes it seems a little weak for what it is, as the hitch did poke through the box, but as it's a very solid hitch, it was not damaged at all, didn't even notice a scratch on it, I wouldn't be too worried if the box looks damaged. Additionally I did find the bolt distance to be off as well, however that was not a big problem, it does fit.Probably the biggest issue was that I needed to make a trip to the store to get the correct bolts, because the holes were threaded on my van, so they either had to be drilled out, or the correct bolts purchased. They must not all be this way, but I'd suggest checking if the holes are threaded so you don't need to make another trip if you don't have a way to drill them out."
75524,2,"I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in, but not without considerable effort. Now that it's in the bike, I am a bit worried about it sealing properly. If I had it to do again, I would go with a different hi-flo aftermarket filter, or the OEM."

From the pictures on the webpage you are thinking beige/tan.... product is actually more of a medium brown and a far cry from anything beige. Not wanting to deal with the hassle of returning the item, I will just deal with the color. Other than that, good product."
123646,1,"We just returned from our vacation in Myrtle Beach SC. It is about a 7 Hr. drive for us. While searching the internet a came across the this bag and was worried about it's size and being able to handle heat and 75 MPH, so after looking at the reviews there was all kind of worried going thru my head rain,straps breaking, having to live with my wife if i left our luggage in the middle of I95. I am here to say that besides a little tough to load on a Ford expedition it is GREAT, Great PRICE, and weather proof! We ran through rain that slowed traffic to about 40 MPH on the interstate,we got home everything was dry.Size? WE actually got 4 peices of luggage( one good size and 3 ""carry-on "" sized)in the bag with plenty of room for other loose bags. I will recommend using 2 rachet straps for extra tie down sercurity. In the end its weather proof, sturdy, great price, and did the job! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

133551,2,I wanted to darken the plastic trim on my 2006 Xterra and this product seemed to fit the bill. And it does darken the trim as long as you are looking from a passing car at 60 mph. Up close it is full of streaks and blotches. As bad as that is the design of the applicator is worse. You have to push it against the areawhich wish to treat but if that area is on the side of the car where most trim is then it run down in a black river all over the paint. RUnined a perfectly good towel in wiping it off before it dried.

I tried breaking up ice as they show in pictures and videos, but nothing worked. The design also makes it impractical to clean the front windshield because it REQUIRES 2 hands to keep good pressure and to stabilize it."

144705,0,"This unit (Milton 506) seems very sturdy compared to theCampbell Hausfeld MP6000 Tire Inflator with Gauge. I would advise against dropping either one more than a few inches, however.The Milton's pressure gauge is tiny, making readings less accurate compared to theCampbell Hausfeld MP6000 Tire Inflator with Gauge. The Milton's pressure gauge is oil filled, possibly making it less susceptible from damage from being dropped. Neither of these units have any way to adjust the gauge accuracy.The Milton's gauge has no tick marks below 10psi, so is unsuitable for low-pressure measurements.The chuck on the Milton 506 does not clip to the valve stem, requiring 2 hands to operate (one to hold the chuck onto the valve stem, and one to hold the lever). The chuck on the Campbell Hausfeld MP6000 clipped onto the valve stem, which I found convenient.The Milton 506 does not have the deflation action built into the spring-loaded inflator lever. The Campbell Hausfeld MP6000 had a convenient deflator button next to the inflator lever, for one-handed operation.For ruggedness, the Milton 506 wins. However, for the larger gauge, convenience of one-handed operation, and 1/3 the price, the more fragile Campbell Hausfeld MP6000 may be more appealing to some."

147807,1,"This organizer is a very reasonable price and very handy. There are an amazing amount of pockets and places to slide things. The only potential negative I found is that when all its main compartments are empty it will collapse but for our full life it's not a problem because it's never that empty. I would defiantly recommend this product for moms with small kids it has made my ""home"" (van) away from home very organized and I always have diapers, wipes, snacks and other necessities very handy and well organized!"
156438,0,"I bought these splashguards for my 2004 Dodge Ram. They fit nicely and appeared to be very sturdy, however, the standard tires on this truck are about an inch wider than these splashguards. Since I bought them to keep the snow off my running boards, I feel that they are going to be only partially effective. This product would have been just perfect if it had just another inch or two width to cover the splashback."

163786,0,The part came on time and installed easily. Only after it was installed and tested did I notice an exhaust system vibration. This was due to the new muffler hangers not allowing enough clearance between the exhaust pipe and a frame member. This can be corrected by bending the hangers for more clearance or obtaining rubber hangers longer than the original ones to provide more clearance.

As this is being written in mid-winter, folks should read the directions and make sure [as the manufacturer suggests] that the can is reasonably warm for best results.I've used them for several flats and slow leaks over the last 25 years, and they've worked beautifully.Note: Honda (at least for my 2005 Pilot) advises against using products like this, if you have the automatic tire pressure checking feature.

1586,0,"Got this Xantrex in anticipation of hurricane Irene. Unboxed this powerpack and first thing I noticed is the LCD display did not work at all. I could not tell whether it was charging or working or anyting. Unbelievable. I left it plugged in for 24 hours hoping that it was taking the charge. Irene hit and electricity went out. This device worked well for powering up small stuff like iPhones, Macbooks, jambox and running a 60 watt light. however, when I plugged in my very Small coffeemaker, it didn't work ... wouldn't charge. My only real disappointment is the failure of the LCD display - I could not tell if the unit was charging, I could not tell how much juice was left in the battery as I ran it, etc."

82261,2,"I bought this ATF because KIA Diamond type III was listed as a compatible ATF. NOT SO!!I found this out the hard way. When I replaced the transmission ATF with Valvoline MaxLife in my 2001 Kia Optima, I immediately experienced rough shifting and severe slippage. I drove several days thinking that the ATF needs to be stabilized, but the shifting did not improve.I did some research on the Web and found out that the OEM ATF for Kia calls for Diamond type III (3) which is used by Mitsubishi and Kia. The two other ATF certified to replace Diamond type III (3) are Mobil 1 ATF and Castrol Import MultiVehicle.Valvoline MaxLife ATF is NOT compatible with Diamond type III (3), contrary to the label on the back of the bottle.I immediately replaced the ATF with Castrol Import MultiVehicle and saw a drastic improvement in shifting. Because I did a drain and replace, some Valvoline Maxlife ATF is still in my car. I'll have to do another ATF change with Castrol (or Mobil 1) to get the correct ATF mixture.If your car ATF specs are for Diamond type III (3), stay away from Valvoline Maxlife ATF."
115032,0,"I bought this item for my 1978 Chevrolet G20 van's back door lock. Evidently, the back door lock is not the same as the front door locks, as this item wasn't a direct drop-in replacement.Being too lazy to return it, I simply modified the existing lock bracket-arm (the part that actuates the locking latch) with a Dremel to fit the new lock. Unfortunately, the new lock is in the always-locked position (meaning that you must insert the key and turn to unlock and open the door, but you must return the key to the locked position to get the key out) but it's not a big deal for me.As for the item otherwise, it has fine build quality and all the parts you need to replace the FRONT door locks."

It's pretty, it looks like it could be very useful, and it has a nice design. But it won't charge."
160544,1,"I've put these things on all of my cars over the last 15+ years, and I'll keep putting them on. They're stylish, clean, easy to apply, provide great functionality, and hold tight for years in all kinds of weather. One thing I would suggest however, if you are looking at a set of ventvisors for your car... get the &#34;ON CHANNEL&#34; ones, not the &#34;IN CHANNEL&#34; style. ON channel means that the fisor sticks to the outside of the window channel. IN channel style models slide up into the groove that the window goes into at the top of the door, and sometimes don't sit exactly perfectly right, which means they can bind on the glass when you are rolling up the window. This is particularly a pain when it happens on any window other than the driver's door, because you can't reach it to fix it without getting out of the car! So... definitely buy the ON CHANNEL ones. Other than that, A+ perfect, I love them and I'll keep buying them for any more cars I get."

158740,0,the housings are barely put together and the cut off line for the beam of light is very distorted. not too happy with this product.
7843,0,Got it as a replacement for the one that came with my camelbak. Old one got a small hole in the plastic where it always bent as I put it back in the pack after re-filling. Duct-tape only worked so long. So far this one is working fine. Last one lasted about 2 years.
21354,1,"I really like my AVS VentVisors, this is the 5th car that I've put them on. I just wish they'd offer them in an in-channel configuration. These particular visors are taped onto the doors rather than being secured into the top of the window channel, as every other visor I've used has been.Pros: Does what they say! Keeps out rain, lets you ventilate the car (important in both summer AND winter), and it doesn't look terrible.Cons: This particular visor is taped to your door. That tape will eventually give way, and you'll either lose the visor or it'll flap against the door until you pull it off.Suggestion to manufacturer: If the window has a channel, that's the only place the visor should go. I understand this design for (ex: BMW M3's) cars that have no surround on the door, but not this particular one."

144019,0,"High quality springs, good progressive rate allowing a relatively smooth ride while still being very sporty in the turns and when breaking. However, I really don't recommend them with stock Honda Civic or Integra dampers. The drop on them is too low for OEM dampers causing them to bottom out way too often which will ruin them pretty quickly. OEM dampers just don't have enough travel left to assure proper damping. Also the wheels scrub into the fender wells (especially the front ones) and I'm riding 16 inch wheels with semi low profile tires. To be fair, I have to say I don't have a sway bar upfront, but these are meant to be used by people riding 16-20 inch wheels. So buy them with aftermarket dampers, or get the Pro-Kit, which is what I'm switching to."
1736,1,"Installation was a bit of a Payne, but all in all product is great, make sure to have two people doing the job as you have to have someone holding the hitch while you drill and bolt, installation does not state that you have to take the exhaust mount off and move the exhaust to the side to access the right hole, also make sure to push the mount back as far out as possible so the trailer head does not rub on the bumper. use a thread sealant on the bolt so it stays on forever, its been a few months since I installed this mount several months and its still sturdy. I would recommend to a friend."

45214,0,This battery works well but don't expect more then 3 years of life from it. As a professional photographer for some 30 plus years now I can say this for sure as I use plenty of batteries. Chinese batteries simply don't last nearly as long as the Western made ones use to. However most manufacturers have moved to Asia now and it's pretty hard to find a US or Western spec 8 volt battery. So this is pretty much all that's left. The equipment that I use this in use to be shipped with a Sonnenschein battery (Made in Germany) and I still have some that are over 10 years old still working perfectly. However even Sonnenschein has moved some of their manufacturing to Asia now. For the money I guess I can't complain.......
14480,1,"This hitch is great. It is very unobtrusive, as it fits close to my bumper. It arrived in great shape, and mounted easily in under an hour. That included unpacking the box and gathering my tools. I didn't even have to drop my spare tire.

Very happy with this product. It looks great and I'm sure it will work great."

The price was the best I could find and the delivery was as they stated. The product is something I was already familiar with and the quality is excellent. I truly do not have to shop around just enter it in the search no matter how obscure the product you are looking for.

(Why even Bother asking us what make and model our car is, right?!)It is Completely ridiculous how expensive these mats are, and you still have to ""Cut"" them. And what doesn't make sense to me, is that if I cut them, then it loses the ""barrier edge"" which is supposed to hold the stuff in, else dirt and liquids will just run off the sides making the mats COMPLETELY USELESS!!!Even with trimming it wont fit, and I feel so unsafe using them as the driver-side mats."

The system did seem to add performance, along with an aftermarket intake filter system and programmer added at the same time to increase towing ability for a 25' travel trailer. Unfortunately, the exhaust sound was a constant, tiring, annoying ""drone"" at about 2000 rpm, which is where most highway miles happen.I contacted Magnaflow with a list of questions, but received only a partial answer and they did not respond to a follow up email with the unanswered questions. However, per their recommendation and the advice of a local dealer, I had a larger (longer) Magnaflow muffler installed. The noise was even greater! I then had Dynamat installed throughout the vehicle (doors and floor) at significant cost, but with no appreciable noise reduction. With no response from Magnaflow, the dealer then recommended a GM stock replacement muffler - problem cured, but at still more cost to me.The additional performance may be as advertised, however, the increased noise was not worth the extra hp, and the lack of appropriate mfr response to specific questions was the reason for the rating."

For those who are interested in actual measurements of what you receive, here they are: Driver side: 25-1/2 inch x 17-1/2 inch x 1/4 inch thick - yes only 1/4 inch thick, but mats appear sturdy -(manufacturer lists specs as 26 x 17-3/4 x 1-1/4). On the Driver side the rubber type heel rest is 10-1/2 inch wide x 6 inch. There are no holes in the mats and my car has 2 knobs that stick up so that you can attach the mats at their rear points. (If you want this, you need to make your own holes provided your vehicles has the knobs to attach the mat). The rear mats are 13 inch x 17-1/2 inch - I could not figure out which way to lay them as the longer side cover the full back, but the longer side also can cover the feet that may rest under the front seats where the kids put their feet/boots. The Passenger mat is about the same size as Drivers, but it does not have the rubber type heel rest. The rubber heel rest starts about 13 to 14 inches above the top of the Driver mat. Overall, they don't fit exactly, but I did not expect them to. And, they do the job at a low cost. I had them one month. If they hold up for one year, I will be satisfied with this purchase."
33991,1,"I had one of these years ago and finally after about 10 years it just worn out. I was so pleased to find these seats at Amazon, I put it in my car the day it came and the wonderful fast heat was so fantastic in the -10 degree weather. Thinking about buying another one jic, because I don't ever want to be without one!"
84927,0,This was my first experience ordering floor matts online. I was not impressed by the product when it arrived: the material is rather thin and soft. This makes cutting the material a breeze but I fear longevity of the product will fail. I recomend going to your local auto-store or junk yard and buying one there.Pros:Easy to cutNice pricePlenty of grooves to catch dirtCons:Thin/soft material

144898,1,"The winch is great. Very good quality, warranty, solidly built, etc. But geez, you'd think a company as well known as Warn could provide some assembly instructions. This unit comes with multiple small books in a half dozen languages on using the winch, but in all that there is half of one page on wiring, which is pointless because they engrave which wires attach to which posts right on the housing. Nothing about mounting the electronics box at all. The box allegedly has several mounting options, but the only guidance is the pic on the box, so I'd count that as 1 option. And of course, that option doesn't work for my layout, so I had to McGuyver the thing together."
76183,0,"First of all, I'd like to say how pleasurable it is to shop online here at Amazon.com. The whole buying and shipping process is always a breeze and I hardly shop anywhere else online now. Highly recommended.This review is for both of these related products:CIPA 48000 Ford OE Style Manual Replacement Driver Side MirrorCIPA 48100 Ford OE Style Manual Replacement Passenger Side MirrorI have a 1991 Ford F150 XLT and after nearly 20 years of exposure, it needed new mirrors. I thought about trying to restore the old ones, removing the rust, etc., but decided to get new ones instead and these CIPA ones seemed reasonably priced. They do look good and fit the existing mounting points on the doors perfectly. The brackets are a little different than the factory ones, but still work OK. They even come with hardware to mount them if your truck had a different factory mirror setup, though you would have to drill holes in the door in this case.The bad news is that both mirrors distort the view ever so slightly, but just enough to be annoying. Backing up is especially troublesome as depth of vision is off. A couple of times I almost backed into my garage when I thought I was still 3 feet away and was actually less than a foot away. Bottom line, they are nowhere near the quality of the factory originals. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I did hope for better.I'm still using the mirrors for now, but have decided to go ahead and restore the originals ... a little naval jelly, steel wool, flat black paint, new mounting bolts and they're looking a lot better. My advice is to pass on these and spring for the Ford ones or shop around a salvage yard if yours are wrecked."

40719,0,"I bought this to help fix some problems my '99 Buick Century developed, mainly the climate control system. However, this book covers light maintenance at best. It doesn't even mention the climate control system that was an option on this vehicle, let alone how to troubleshoot it. It felt rushed, as some of the pictures/information didn't even seem to belong to this generation vehicle."

141270,2,"This product functioned, but offered no description in the instructions as to what the blinking light means. Sometimes it was on solid, sometimes it blinked.The first time I drove in the car I hit a pot hole and it cracked the solar panel. Keep in mind, the item did not fall off the window. The suction cups held it, but somehow the jarring force cracked it. Now it only blinks intermittently and a voltage meter test confirms that it doesn't charge reliably now. I gave it to my kid to play with.I would recommend looking for something a little sturdier unless you are going to take it out of your car before going anywhere."
103250,1,"I have a system that holds 16 quarts, so draining and refilling is pain.The first one that was delivered had a small chip out of the inside of the gauge.I returned it and they immediately sent out a new one, that arrived without defect.Since then I've used it about 5 times, works great! I highly recommend it if youdo much of this type of work."

84771,0,I do like the steering wheel cover except for a couple items:1- The smell of the steering wheel cover has lasted for over a month now and the smell comes off on your hands.2- The white Steeler emblem started coming off a week after we put it in the car. It was tacky feeling from the first day and started wearing off shortly after that.
70702,0,The prescription is fine for the glasses but they are too small of an area to work with. I have to move my head around in the lenses to see read anything. They are not for everyone. If they made the reader lenses larger they would get a 5 star but as they are now I can only give them a 3 star rating. If they have a good return policy to get what you need I would pay more for the right ones.

101770,0,"I bought this to replace a bottle of ArmorAll 'Extreme Tire Shine'. It's better in most, but not all ways.First, smell. This product smells like a grape snack. It's delightful. I kept having to tell myself it wasn't a food item when I was applying it.Second, mess. There isn't one. Applying ArmorAll is a two step process: rub in the shine, then clean the brown overspray residue from the rims. This product requires no rim cleaning. Apply it to a sponge or cloth, wipe it on the tires, and whatever hits the rims will be clear.Third, endurance. ArmorAll lasts maybe three days for my garaged Nissan. This product lasts a week before the effect begins to fade.Fourth, shine. Here's where it falls short. The shine is not high gloss. It's a mild gloss that doesn't quite do waxed black paint justice. On a glance, most people probably gauge your detailing more by how shiny your tires are rather than the quality of your paintwork. The ArmorAll will impress them for the minimal time it's effective. This won't. But if you're not trying to draw undue attention, the mild shine could be asset.Would I buy it again? No, probably not. I'd shoot for the same endurance with a bit more shine. But it's still worth a try for any would-be sleeper."

33188,2,"Product failed at the beginning of the first use on a relatively new Kubota RTV 500. Directions were followed and the oil extraction tube inserted through the oil dipstick tube went in with no effort. Before pumping up the unit, I tried to bring the extraction tube out a little, and although I never felt it hit bottom, it became stuck somewhere in the oil pan. The oil was drained manualIy, and new oil extraction tube remains inside the oil pan. System failure. The extraction tube was cut off, dipstick reinserted, and after talking with the Kubota folks, I will end up taking the Kubota to the dealer to pull the engine, remove the oil pan and remove the oil extraction tube. I would call your dealer if you plan on using this product for any ATV type vehicle."

43732,0,"I purchased this scanner at approximately $80 before the discount went into effect. At the time, I had a 2004 BMW 530i and a 2004 Dodge Viper SRT-10. The scanner read OBDII codes flawlessly for both cars, and was extremely easy to use. However, the ""erase"" function was completely broken -- it just said ""FAIL"" on the screen when trying to erase codes.I wrote the company for a resolution, but was unable to receive one. They wanted a receipt, which I understand, but refused to accept a duplicate receipt printed from the point of sale register. Now, I have a half-working scanner."

176470,0,I bought these as a replacement for my originals which had become seized. I noticed that one caliper had reused pistons that appeared to be sanblasted to remove rust as they were pitted but without rust. . Not sure how this affects integrity or reliability. Within a month the calipers have rusted on the outside as the metallic paint they came with wore off. Even the new zinc coated bolts rusted. Also one caliper drags slightly. Overall not so impressed from a brand like Raybestos. Had higher expectations for these.
156433,0,Spend the extra money and get ones that fit the truck. I bought these for a 2005 4x4 toyota truch. Took an effort to install and they still don't look right. Much smaller than originals and don't line up to original flaps.

65977,1,"After reading over many forums and a great bit of time on various sites pondering what mods would be best for our F350 7.3L DRW 4x4, and using Donalson products in my line of work, I decided that this setup would do the most good for air filtration and letting that diesel &#34;breathe easier&#34; and bring down EGTs.Donaldson designed this unit for Ford and they have been making air filtration systems you see on Catepillars and Semi's all over this country. At my work, I have first-hand knowledge - having gone away from paper/foam combinations offered by many small engine manufacturers as OEM and gone to Donaldson. Two ways an engine goes downhill - Don't change your oil and filter enough ( an/or use the right grade) , and don't keep the air going in clean - ...get you every time.This unit isn't incredibly different from what was in the truck as it was, but I feel there's much more open surface area on the new element and that's where; combined with a 4&#34; SS exhaust system - it will perform as intended."

I bought one of these 19"" blades and a 24"" blade for my car this past Spring.As this was a hand-me-down car, I had not changed the wiper blades before, and was a bit worried I'd screw it up. No problems, however, with a quick YouTube how-to video and these ANCOs were installed in minutes.They have performed well above what I'd expect for the, about, $11 I paid for them (purchased at WalMart).We do not get much rain here in Southern California but we get plenty of sun and my car is parked outside at work all day. As such, these budget blades have lasted around 9 months before showing signs of replacement, which is what brought me to Amazon to purchase them again.Great buy, do not hesitate to purchase!"
180060,2,"I got this product for road tar and bug stains after traveling to Florida. I had used Klasse All-in-one for most of the residue but was having problems removing smaller stains and thought a product made strictly for cleaning might work better. Not so. Basically very few of the really deep road tar stains came out even though I rubbed it like a maniac ( of course, using a soft cloth). Really, I would have to say that the Klasse worked far better with less effort."
182183,0,"One little plastic piece that held a suciton cup in broke. Now one suction cup is floating around my car somewhere. Maybe I tried to get it off my window the wrong way, but it gave pretty easily to breaking.The other suciton cups stuck for a bit, but one really hot day, they gave in. At least I can still use the product with it only missing one suction cup. I still like the product, because it keeps the sun out of my little guys eyes. So that's good! I'd probably buy it again, because I like the cover, and the 4 little suciton cups that aren't in my way. I would just be extremely careful with the suction cups."
95599,0,"got one of these for my Honda Element and it was delivered in time by Summit Racing by UPS and that was well.The box it was in, was for a about 12"" longer than it needed to be and didn't have any paper or filler to absorb shock.

172927,0,"I had Weathertech mats in my Infiniti FX35, but when I bought an old truck I thought I would save some money as these are about 1/3 cheaper. I was not impressed with the fit though, and they aren't as rigid as the weathertech mats either. The look was ok, but for the price I wasn't pleased. Amazon took them right back so no problem there though. I went with a set of 30 dollar mats from my local auto parts store and although they don't give the complete coverage, they don't get in the way and are a little thicker and certainly cheaper. So I would suggest either going with exact fit mats, or something cheaper and which you can see in person."

71671,1,What I like about this filter besides the added performance is the fact that it is reusable. That means you never have to buy another filter again. It is also covered by K&N; 1 million mile warranty. I would suggest going on K&N; website and filling out the warranty form (left side on their site close to the bottom click on warranty then scroll down to the bottom and click on the form link) just in-case you might want to be covered by the warranty. They suggest cleaning the filter every 50k miles that also depends on your driving conditions. I useK&N; 99-5050 Filter Care Service Kit - Squeezeto clean my filter.

50097,0,"I thought this would be a perfect fit for the rear of my tahoe given that each product is made specifically for the intended vehicle. The rear mat required cutting before we could insert it and it didn't give any warning of that on the item description. I almost sent it back before I found in the directions that you may have to cut in the center of the mat to allow the mat to fit around your front center console. Obviously we aren't professionals and haven't done that before so we didn't cut it perfectly and now there is some exposed carpet around the console which kind of defeats the purpose of this waterproof mat. The sides don't fit perfectly and are kind of floppy around the door frame. For the most part it works and covers most of the carpet to protect it from my two year old and all his mess. But I do think the description is a little misleading in that ""laser cut for your vehicle"" doesn't necessarily mean that its going to fit exactly right. and I think they need to tell you about the need to cut the rear mat for some vehicles."
114957,0,"If you're deciding whether to buy this, then this review might not help. That's because I'm really conflicted over whether I like it or not. So it's A LOT bigger than the picture makes it seem, which is a good thing, and it fits comfortably in my bucket seat. It stays on fine too, and I'm not sure why other reviewers had such trouble with this. But it makes me look like an old man taxi cab driver, and I think the wooden beads smell a little funky. I bought it to keep my back cool this summer, and for that, it's been working just fine."

143589,0,"This is an edited review. I had a pair of these lamps installed in my 2006 Ford Focus. I tried to install my self but found it very difficult to do due to very little clearance. I since have found out how to do so that I did not have to take the car to a repair facility when one of the lamps failed after less than two years of service. I am a 'seasoned' driver and require every lumen I can get so I am happy with the increased output of the lamps but had hoped to get more life from them. They are not cheap by any means but if you need the extra light as I do they will do the job. Yes, I replaced with the same lamp and would do so again now that I found a way to change them myself. A hint, use a lubricant on the ""O"" ring when trying to seat the lamp into the headlight assembly and yes, saliva works well."

A couple of weeks later I rode about 200 miles in rainy conditions as well as rain while I trailered my ATV to the trail. The box kept all of the water out as well. I am not a huge fan of the lid bungies. When the originals wear out I will come up with something better. For the price, this box has a lot to offer."

49918,0,"Take a good look at the little picture of the unit here on Amazon. That is the best explanation that you will get of how this device should look when assembled. I am a very technical guy but I had a hard time with this. I suspect that the less technical among us will not be able to install this device successfully.The instructions are horrid. And very small. They try to get many different languages on two sides of one piece of paper. Multiple pages, with pages of illustration, would be more appropriate, and at the markup they must be getting for this, surely not too costly.There are really puny plasterboard fasteners in the package, as mentioned by other reviewers. Hanging the cargo box from plasterboard as Thule would have you do is nuts in my opinion. The entire weight of the box will be resting on brittle plasterboard and whatever few screws are holding that plasterboard to your ceiling. It might all come down, destroying the box, or bashing your car's roof if that's what's under it, or injuring whoever it falls upon. Get the pulleys into the studs. Go get good screws from the hardware store. I used 3-inch #14 self-drilling screws with hex heads which I found in the home depot, they're next to the deck screws.Seven separate pieces have to be attached to your ceiling. Getting the center shaft bracket aligned with the other two is so difficult that some folks just leave it out. The holes in these things aren't set up to hit studs. I ended up getting one side of each pulley in a stud and the other in a plasterboard fastener - but a better one than came in the box. I put the center shaft brackets in a drill press and made holes in the right places to get them to work with studs.Thule, this needs a redesign.Bruce Perens (bruce at perens dot com)"
114625,0,"The filter promises more horsepower and improved mileage. From my standpoint, in my car, there is no noticable improvement in acceleration, from a performance standpoint, it seems to be the exact same car.As for mileage, I was averaging 25.x MPG before the filter in mixed (highway/city) driving. This has improved to 26.x MPG, so on average, I picked up between 1.0 - 1.5 MPG, so that was nice.The longevity of the filter is appealing and since it will be a while before it needs to be cleaned, I can't comment on the maintaining the filter. I will likely buy a MazdaSpeed 3 before the filter needs to be cleaned."
126433,0,"Some parts fit, some parts don't. And despite following the directions and only using the larger spring for a street pump, the pump then put out far too much pressure. 12-14psi instead of 4-6psi. Put my old spring back in and all was good.Biggest issue was that Amazon would not freight this rebuild kit internationally. No reason was given why. Pretty annoying really."
60094,0,"Ordered a set of front mats for my 2005 Ford Sport Trac. Quality is average, price above average. Fit is poor. Took out old mats as told, but floor clips are in the wrong places to hold down new mats. Directions say to make sure to use floor clips so new mats don't move around. I could have just gone to any auto store and purchased a much less expensive set that would have fit the same way. Oh well, another lesson learned."

1006,1,"Expensive! That's what a lot of people say about K&N; filters. However, they are typically less than the cost of two OEM filters, which are not reusable. So in the long run, you can (and do) save money. However, this particular filter (BM-1205) is no longer used in current vehicle production, so I was able to get it less than half of what it normally costs.Also, K&N; gets a lot of criticism for ""letting in dirt"" and for ""messing up MAF's"". If you use it and reoil it right, it performs just as well as an OEM filter. Its when you over oil it that you start messing up MAF's and when you don't do any maintenance on it is when it starts letting dirt through. I've used them in many of my vehicles over the years and have never had a problem. MY UOA's (used oil analysis) have come out clean over the years I've used this with minimal silicon being reported (silicon = dirt).Also, even though many report having an increase in power/torque/MPG's, I have not. So don't expect to, either. But you will save some money in the long run if you intend to keep your vehicle and you service this filter as recommended."
88299,1,Great product for the money spent. Bought it to haul my kayak on top of my camper shell equipped Toyota Tacoma. Other rack systems are so much more expensive so I thought I'd give this a try after all the reviews on here. I was nervous at first hauling the kayak with this racking system but after a couple of trips on the highway totaling 200+ miles I am very happy with my purchase.

32173,0,"I realize that all such products originate overseas nowadays, but at least for an electronic device this might even be a plus. Unfortunately, I found the quality of this device even below my modest expectations.#1 - The red banana jack was the wrong size! It had a smaller hole than the black, so much so that I could not insert a banana plug! To fix this, you must disassemble the unit, unsolder the jack, put it in a vise and drill it out to the proper size, and then solder it back in. This is unacceptable for a brand new out-of-the-box purchase.#2 - The instructions include a picture of the device and state several times not to try and get more than 7 amps out of it. The power supply itself and the outer box state 10 amps. That's quite a difference. Which is it?#3 - The fan is very noisy -- much noisier than the old PC power supply I was using before.#4 - There is no ON-OFF switch, so to get the fan turned off you have to unplug the power cord.There are several worthy competitors to this product, in retrospect I wish I had purchased one of the others."

128665,0,"I needed a bike rack for three people but didn't want to hassle with taking the front tires off and putting them back on- after all, we didn't have far to drive. Anyway, this bike rack fit the bill. It assembled a little less than smoothly but we were able to get it muscled into where it needed to be. I agree with other postings here, if you spend some time tweaking the adjustments once you have it in your vehicle you will find it works just fine. Try to stand back and look at it and then adjust the tension rods so you have it as centered as possible in the truck bed. This will pay off when you are transporting more than two bikes. Other good point to note: the directions tell you to put the bike's back tire into the rack. This is crucial and stabilizes the bike.For good measure I bought an inexpensive set of long bungees to secure the bikes from hopping around and collapsing when we drive over big bumps in the road. I run the bungees from the bike rack through the front tire and back to the rack. This has been a great help in stabilizing the bikes.I think this bike rack works well for the price if you are on a budget and especially if you prefer to keep your front bike tires on when traveling."

54635,1,"When I bought my new bike, the HD dealership was really pushing the purchase of a battery tender, claiming it would double the life of my battery. The ""official"" HD Tender was $39.99 + sales tax. I read on the HD Forums about the 021-0123 Battery Tender Junior 12V Battery Charger, and based on those positive comments located one here at Amazon and purchased it. The Tender arrived on time, and since my Superglide was already wired for a Tender it was simply plug-in and charge. No wiring whatsoever on my part, and the Tender works perfectly. I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I'm sure this would work just as well for snowmobile, boat and wave-runner batteries. It comes with the piggy tails you need to connect to your battery if your toy isn't already pre-wired. The Junior version has a single LED light, Red=Charging, Blinking Green=80% or more charged, Solid Green=100% charged. All in all this is a high quality Tender and looks exactly like the one I considered buying at the HD Dealership except for the branding. The best part? I saved almost $18.00 by purchasing here at Amazon :"

It is every bit as good as a snap on impact I borrowed from a friend. yesterday I did two vehicles ,one was a snap the other had studs on it that had been over tightened and rust as well and after I was done the battery still had two full bars left. I am impressed with the power and the way I can change the position of the battery. I now own three Milwaulkee V28 sawsalls and now this V28 1/2 inch impact. I highly recommend this product to anyone that really needs to have a dependable tool that won't let them down while on the job."

32959,0,"When this MSD Ignition 8680 Timing Controller worked, it worked well and I could adjust the timing from the driver's seat for different conditions. If I was in traffic I could advance the timing to get the engine to run a little cooler. If I needed higher idle speed when the engine was cold (no choke, race carb), I would just advance the timing. For optimum performance I could adjust the timing accordingly. It allows 15 degrees of adjustment. It is relatively easy to install and I am using it with an MSD billet ready-to-run distributor and a MSD Digital 6 Plus Ignition unit. Overall when everything was working, the engine (502 ci 600hp) ran great and started easily with no kickback (20 deg retard from Digital 6 Plus ignition unit). The engine even started great when hot. Overall a great unit with one major exception. It quit working just over a year after I bought. I doubt that it even has 500 miles on it. The unit is installed in the passenger compartment so it never gets hot or wet (car is not driven in the rain anyway). I really expected better from MSD as they are supposed to be the best. So that is a $150 down the drain and I hate to think that every year I'm going to have to buy a new one. If you are willing to risk the cost and downtime when it fails, then go for it. I need this system for this particular car and so I'm going to buy two so that I have a spare for when it fails again.I sent in the failed MSD controller and was pleasantly surprised when the repair cost was only $11.50! But with shipping both ways, the total came to about $35, still not a bad cost for repairing a $150 controller. Because of this very reasonable repair cost, I have changed my rating to 3 stars."

This is perfect! My car is rather small (Lexus IS 250), however this organizer fits only 1/2 of the trunk. It is somewhat sturdy, and has 3 organizers dividers. The dividers are rather flexible, and so is the organizer itself. If you only need one compartment, the organizer will not squish so you must use the whole organizer width and length.The extra compartments on sides are wonderful! I have used one side to put my umbrellas, and will definitely find multiple uses for the other sides.For around $20, I am rather impressed at the quality of the materials. Especially, the extra side compartments (the net is sturdy), and on 2 of the sides it also has velcro.So far, in the 3 compartments, I have fitted in 1 of them: 2 2"" 3 ring binders, and other folders; another compartment--all of my re-usable bags-Be Green!-- 3rd compartment-my gym bag.Now, I am looking to get another one to fit the other half of my trunk space!

88285,1,"Given the economic price didn't expect great things from this rack however I was encouraged by the reviewer who had no place for J clips (me neither) and that a strap across the inside worked. I did the same thing and it works great with my kayak, nice and secure. Did have to glue the rubber pads on but that was no big deal. You do need to know however if you are travelling in rain, the strap gets wet and seeps down into the inside of the vehicle (hence the rating of 4 not 5) Other than that am very pleased, for me this works better than a permanent mount roof rack as I don't lose gas mileage when I don't need the rack."

I've had it on a window which gets hit by rain, sun, etc. and it isn't fading one bit and is still holding on strong. Love that it came in a pack of 2 also.

140051,1,"I wish I would've taken before and after pics but I wasn't the least bit optimistic when I started my ""project"" with this product. We have a convertible that had sat, in inoperable condition, for the better part of two years. It has a cloth top and gets extremely dusty even when the top and windows are up. I used Vinylex on the dash and all vinyl and plastic parts and wow, just wow - the results were so much better than expected and it was so quick. Next project was the convertible boot that affixes to the car while the top is down to give it a finished appearance. I am ashamed to admit that we had left this poor boot hanging in an area that gets rust overspray from a nearby air conditioner, again for two straight years. This thing started out black and after two years of neglect was a mixture of dirt and rust color, with one end being almost solid dirt and the other being almost solid rust. I fully expected to have to discard but thought I'd try the Vinylex - Just In Case. Two applications within minutes of each other restored this thing to like new condition!?! We honestly could not believe it. I now use this for bonded leather furniture, aka vinyl ottomans, in the living room and family room, too, and of course - it works beautifully. In my opinion this is nothing short of a miracle product. I loathe writing reviews (I guess because I usually don't have anything new to offer) but depend on them heavily when making purchases so I felt compelled to share my experience with this Amazing Stuff! =) If you need a vinyl cleaner, try this - you won't be sorry!"

8597,0,I bought this becuase the manufacturer website for Bulldog remote start systems said this was what I needed for a 1999 Chevrolet Silverado pickup. The Harness was what I needed but there were supposed to be grooves/spaces in the connector where it connected to the back of the fuse box of the truck. I had to cut out the grooves/spaces that were needed to allow the harness to fit/snap into the back of the fuse box as it was supposed to do. Either the factory forgot to make the space/grooves in the harness end or it was not the correct harness that I should have ordered like the Bulldog manufacturer website had indicated. Anyhow I did get it to work.
153760,2,Like my title says the tach is cheap. Went to hook it up to my 96 S10 and it needs an $35 adaptor but it doesnt tell you unless you look at a list they include with it. So it goes from $35 for the tach to $70 for the tach and adaptor. There are many cars and trucks that need the adaptor so i suggest you read up before ordering. Also the lighting in mine doesnt work because it's a cheaply made tach. Id recommend an Equus tach or Autometer over a Sunpro anytime.

Nowhere near as beefy and as heavy duty appearing as the original. However it does fit and is correct for the vehicle according to Hayden. I have my doubts about it's longevity. The original lasted 141,000 miles and I will be very surprised if this lasts half as long. It seems to be very light duty. Time will tell and I hope I am wrong.

I have used a similar organizer for years in another vehicle, and they are very handy. For some reason the only type of organizers I could find locally were ones for CDs. This Auto Expressions visor organizer works well for what I wanted. It is secured with velcro straps, which is much nicer than the flexible band types that tend to stretch and loosen over time. The pockets are just big enough to hold essential documents and small items. The slot for sunglasses is pretty slim -- I suspect many would not fit in this slot -- but I use it for a pen holder.Pros: inexpensive, holds several small items, covenient velcro straps to attach itCons: no color selection available, very small sunglasses slotOverall, I'm pleased with this purchase. It could be improved with a larger sunglasses slot and some color choices besides dark gray. But if you are like me and only need an organizer for identification items, a small notepad or other small items, and a pen it works great."
39759,2,"After looking on the Delco website and checking the listing for this pump I bought it to install on my 78 GMC 454 truck. Being an inline pump, installation is as easy as it gets, and I also installed an inline filter just before this pump. My first test drive was a let down because the engine hesitated and cut out several times over the course of 20 minutes. Back at home, I pulled the fuel line and found that the pump was only dribbling gas. I replaced it with a Carter pump and all is good now. It could be that I received a defective pump, not sure, but I wasn't taking any chances with a replacement Delco.Also, the pump photo on Amazon is not correct. The EP12S has one 3/8"" nipple on each end and has + and - leads for hookup."
50430,1,The License plate is just as pictured. Easy to install. Has held up well to many years of use on my Father in Law's car.
116924,1,"My family has been using the accutire brand tire gauges for more than 6 yrs now. When I got my car, I thought I will buy one for myself. I ordered this and got free shipping with my Prime account ( Amazon by far has the best collection of accutire gauges at unbeatable prices and free shipping with Prime or orders over $25 ). This has lots of features which we normally don't use. You can program this with predefined pressure settings for all 4 tires, so that you need not remember what should be the pressure in your from and rear tires (Although we generally tend to remember the numbers by heart). That is as far as I have explored in terms of the features.I have been using this for just 6 months, so I do not have an idea about the battery issues most of the reviewers have posted about. I also read a handful of reviews that suggested getting an o-ring to make an accurate measurement. However I found out that mine works perfectly without the o-ring ( I have used this on a 2002 Nissan Maxima and a 2001 Civic ). Also it gives a beep once an accurate measurement is made ( It takes about 2-3 seconds ). It also powers up automatically upon placing it on the tire nozzle.I would easily recommend this to anyone. At $12 this beats any tire gauge ( Analog or Digital ) at any price range."
145276,2,"We used to buy electric (not electronic) fuel pumps for $12 back in the day. I was surprised when I went shopping for a new one, and this was the cheapest one I could find. Well, I guess you still get what you pay for. Mine did not even make the 10 minutes, more like 2 minutes. Obviously a very poor product, and the bean counters at Mr. Gasket would do well to drop this manufacturer and shop elsewhere in China. I will definitely be wary of Prestolite products in the future."
77642,0,"These wipers are overpriced for their performance. They worked ok for 6 months. I was driving last night in the rain, and could not see anything. It is 10 months now. When I looked at the wipers when I got out of the car, the driver side wiper was all warped. The blade was missing all the water in the middle of the windshield. I know that blades are supposed to last only 6 months; but I have gotten a year out of Trico, Anco and others. Hell, I had my factory wipers for 4-5 years. There was some streaking, and chatter but at least most of the water came off the windshield. I just am not impressed."
30762,2,"Even amazon listed this as being compatible in a 2000 mercury cougar. I removed to stock stereo only to find that this adapter is not the right size/number of pins. Amazon won't let me return it, only replace it. I should have paid extra and bough one from a local store, then I could have actually returned it. You're letting me down amazon"
155772,0,The end links and bushings are not included. Otherwise these are a great upgrade for my 20 year old stock sway bar bushings.
100698,2,The wiper blade does not fit the vehicle application that the site recommends for the wiper blade(Infinity QX56-rear window). Perhaps I can use it as a shower squeegee.
6354,2,"I purchased this helmet simply because it said it was DOT approved. Well I am in the military and any helmet I wear is subject to inspection by Base Police, hence how I found out that this helmet was not DOT Approved as the title says it is. I was stuck spending more money on another helmet just to be able to get the bike of base. DO NOT BUY THIS FALSELY ADVERTISED PRODUCT. Save your self the headache and just go to your local motorcycle shop and see if they can order you a DOT Approved German Style Helmet."
65333,2,"The box is original made in USA design. When I purchased the tire plug,it was made in Taiwan and had a different design. I call customer service and they could not find the made in USA king. I find the Taiwan broke off easy and don't go in the tire smooth. I wanted to return the product and the company was nice enought to give it to me at no charge. It takes about three weeks to get the credit money. Its a good thing I bought from a known internet dealer. Thanks Amazon."
166410,0,They hold a lot of CD's but when full they get kind of chunky and they block some of the vision as the visor can't fully hit the roof of the car so they are in your face some. I wish there was some awesome solution to CD storage in cars.
159297,1,"Got exactly what I asked for, in new, off the shelf condition in a reasonable amount of time. I would definately reccomend this vendor."
139454,1,took about 20 mins to install took that long because we had to cut a 2*4 to help pull the rear apart a 1/2&#34; to place in the bolt holes but really easy just make sure you have a friend I used my wife and it only took 20 mins
37695,0,"Bought This for my wie to use,but she refused,found out the jack did not extend high enough to lift the wheels off the ground.This will work if your vehicle is low to the ground."

113249,1,"Put this on my '02 Dodge 1500. Installation was simple, and took about 20 minutes. Gas mileage has increased noticeably, and I think power has increased, although it might just be the sound, which is noticeably louder, and sounds cool.Increase in mileage pays for the unit in under 6 months, so well worth the cost."
21290,0,Ya so this horn was not what we expected. It was not quite the sound that we were looking for and it made many of faces laugh.
168058,0,"The repairs made with this product hold up very well, but if you don't use up the whole tube, no matter how tightly capped it is, the product dries out after a year or two. I am sure there is a way to package it so that this doesn't happen."
184018,1,Great looking item. Ford emblem is chrome but the insert into the hitch is plastic. It came with 2 inserts for differant sized hitches.
155989,1,very happy with this product fit no problem better then the stock one from honda ! bosch is outstanding product
119028,2,"I got the compressor and decided to give it a try before I put it in my trunk. I turned on the car engine to make sure there is enough power, connected the 12V plug and first tested the flashlight feature, works great. I then went and connected the compressor to one of my tires. First thing I noticed was that the reading on the compressor was off, it showed 28 psi on a tire for which a simple pressure gauge showed 36. Not a big deal I guess, it's a compressor not a gauge. The real problem was that the compressor never worked, turned it on and off a few times, played with the shut-off knob, but nothing complete silence. This unit is heading back to Amazon...maybe it's great when it works.On another note, the unit has a compartment for the power and air cables. It's extremely tight and pretty much once you take those cables out and stretch them it's almost impossible to get them back in there, would make sense to make the unit a bit bigger for easier storage."
36978,2,"I recently purchased this tool primarily for bleeding brakes. Despite repeated attempts and following the instructions explicitly, I was unable to develop a vacuum in the bleeder container. The pump by itself could attain a modest amount of vacuum with my finger held against the inlet opening, but the tool did not work as advertised. I returned the tool and am awaiting a refund. (And I bled the brakes without assistance using clear plastic tubing and a small container.)"
77952,2,"This blade does not fit Honda CR-V 2009. It does not match curvature of the windshield. It presses too much on one side and hangs in the air on another side. The same issue with 26"" blade for the driver side.Amazon indicates that this blade fits Honda CR-V 2009 if add it to your garage on Amazon. That's incorrect."
140427,1,"You can clean any kind of metal with this product. I think you should buy it. For the most part it's like copper and silver polish, only it's intended for metal. Sometimes it may leave a few streaks here and there if you don't wipe the surface of the metal entirely. If that happens, apply a touch of water and continue rubbing until the streaks go away."
12097,1,"I was tired of my RV batteries not correctly maintaining charge. Had used other ""Bargain Brand"" chargers with poor results. Seems to be working fine. I use it to maintain two 6 volt batteries wired in series. I am monitoring the price of this item and plan to buy another if and when the price drops. (Easy to do if you leave one in your Amazon Cart.Steve"
68355,1,"I bought the life hammer to keep me out of a potentially life-threatening situation if ever had an accident that trapped me underwater. Then I realized, ""hey, my motorcycle doesn't even have windows OR seat belts. So what good is it for a motorcycle rider?""OK, I won't call it deceptive advertising, but you really need to read the fine print BEFORE buying this. I do think they should make one specifically for motorcycle riders, since no other company is right now - it's a great niche. Until then, I'll continue to use it to crack open walnuts and cut my belt off when I find myself trapped in my pants after eating too many walnuts. For that purpose, it really is a life saver.Thank you Life Hammer! I'll be getting one for everyone I know who owns a car or likes walnuts.Buy this item with confidence - you won't be disappointed! (unless you own a motorcycle, scooter, skateboard, hang glider, ultra-light, ATV, snowmobile, or convertible)."
84289,2,"The quart size in white is discontinued, supposedly due to slow sales. So now, if you have a 8 foot pick-up bed, you have to buy two gallons. I will buy another brand, even though this has good ratings for product."
110348,1,"This product is working great, I used as an aftermarket adition to my car to read with an extra gauge the emisions of my car, I'm very satisfyed even when this is not a pre-heated sensor it does the job good and give you accurate reading after a little time of running your engine to let the sensor to be heated.I would recomend it, great quality and good price."
15724,1,Cylinders work well on the hitch mounted Thule rack. It would be better if they just included these in the price. They do give some security especially for short trips when you don't have the time to secure with cables.
3907,2,"The locker I bought was not good cause the locker I bought was master lock but I got the other company, also I bought the new one and they gave me the used one. It has little rush on it, and the yellow thing was teared."
25805,2,"Blitz has an oil collector with a sloped lid to aid in containing sloshing oil as the pan is moved (dragged) along garage floor. I have used both types, yellow & black, go with the black plastic model with closed top unless you have a high end garage with 'lots of room' and really good tools at hand."
137758,0,"The cover fits perfectly, but the bike is all wet when I uncover it in the morning. My old cover did a better job of keeping it dry."
131981,1,This odd fuse is used on Fisher Snowplows. It was impossible to locate in autopart stores with out purchasing a combination kit. These kits had only 1 of this amperage and 9 of other assorted sizes. got juest what was required.
81520,0,Pump works adequately but I am concerned that it may be made with plastics too light to last long - feels a little flimsy.
95709,1,"OVERVIEW: An overall improvement in stopping power over ""premium"" pads from the auto parts store, but not overly grabby and harsh, and so far have been able to take the heat of my spirited driving style.PROS: Great stopping power, low dust, not grabby/jerkish under light braking but surprisingly powerful under moderate to hard braking.CONS: Had to file off some imperfections in the paint to allow proper sliding of the pads in the caliper and bracket.I would definitely purchase again for the front pads on my 1992 Honda Accord EX with Akebono Calipers."
37030,2,"after 3 bottles of this product on my driveway it did nothing even after 4 applications just cheap bottle of degreaser did a better job, would like to see proof of any kind this cleaner works on new or old oil spots"
87032,1,"Great price, I like the brass fittings as opposed to the PVC fitting my camper currently has. One thing I am upset about, which is my fault because I didn't look harder into it. The white part is plastic not metal like i wanted. No problem though because it works without leaks and makes my camper look that much better because this piece is clean and new, not stained and broken."
156891,0,"The wiper blade itself performs as advertised, and does a nice job of wiping the windshield and maintaining contact across the entire length of the blade. However, I went to lift the blade off my windshield to scrape some snow from underneath it. I grasped it by the plastic that connects the blade to the windshield wiper arm, and it broke like a brittle toothpick. The blade wasn't frozen to the windshield, and I didn't force it by any means. It just broke with hardly any force applied to it, plain and simple. I will probably not order these blades again. For $15 a blade, they need to be of higher quality than that."

100448,2,"The item I was sent is completely different from the picture. I've chosen to keep the product in case it comes of use, but I am VERY unhappy with your services. I expect to get what I see and at this time I was greatly deceived!"
162138,0,"I have owned this for about an year. It is almost dying! Here are some key observations:[1] You have to experiment a bit with frequency. Once tuned, it has a sort of ""break-in"" period! It will perform better if you don't keep changing frequency often and dedicate a specific channel to mp3 listening. In my case 88.5 FM worked the best.[2] You can achieve balanced and almost static free audio by playing with >| button on mp3 player and volume control on your car stereo. Read mp3 player's instruction booklet for more.[3] Over the time (6 to 9 months), mp3 player developed loose contact problem. USB stick slides out just a little of a slot due to gravity-pull and road vibrations. You will end up pulling out and reinserting USB drive again and again. The ones with SD slot do better in this regard. I do not get loose contact problem with SD slot.Also, the 6-position hinge becomes very very loose and will loose its ability to hold positions and will always dangle to the lowest position making display unreadable.When it works, it is good, It does not offer you playlist capabilities with USB stick or SD card. If you own a full-featured mp3 player, you can edit playlist there. It is cheap. Medium to heavy users: Plan to buy a new one every six months to an year!"
130660,0,"I bought these for my 98 m3 4 door, they are working fine but I was disappointed with the price and fitment. There are two studs available for each of the roof rack mounts and these clips only use one of the studs. I bought my Yakima rack used, and it came off of a jetta with Q103 clips. The Q103 clips actually used both studs for each mount but the bend in the clip was slightly off and I want to have the correct fitment. It would have been nice if the Q18 clips used both available studs, and remember the package includes 2 clips, you will need 2 packages (4 clips) to fit your car."
56651,0,"Beware. The title of this product says it's the 12 volt model, but it is actually the 6 volt model. For the 12 volt, you need product number 021-0123. I bought this for my 12V motorcycle and now have to send it back."
23730,1,Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I had to use a wrench to tighten the nut hard enough to keep it from sliding around. Other than that the bend was perfect for getting in the spots I needed to and the orange handle to hold was key!
93232,1,"Great product went on a 15 hour vacation and got caught in the rain, no problems everything remained dry. It did exactly what we needed it too. Just be sure straps are all tied down as they will flap in the wind which gets annoying but once the ends are secured it is perfect."
15816,1,"I'm an avid do-it-yourselfer, but not a bearing expert. These fixed the grinding coming from my original bearings on a 2001 Impala with 130k miles. I feel much better having solid, American built, guaranteed hardware between my family and the road than the cheaper Chinese imports that are only rated to last 20k miles or so. The small price difference is more than worth the peace of mind. Thanks Timken, I hope you guys can withstand the flood of lo-fi foreign parts."
186351,0,"These installed very easily on my HELLA 550 fog lamps. I wanted to have protection from stones and other debris while still having access to the lights without having to get out and remove the factory white stone shields. These covers do not seem to inhibit the performance of the lights.However, be aware that this product contains ONLY ONE stone shield. I suppose this is desired if you have an odd number of lights. It would have been nice for this information to be in the product description.This seems to be a bit expensive for just one stone shield; but, if it works, it works, and I'd rather pay about $35 and have more convenient and protected lights than have no stone shields and have to buy another $100 set of lights."
131963,0,"The product is mis-leading on amazon.com. in the picture, it looks like the ventshades are mounted inside the door tracks, however when mine arrived, they could only be mounted outside of the tracks, directly onto the door frame itself. So be careful when ordering, so you get what you really want. It's too much a hassle for me to return them and re-order other ones. Otherwise, the brand quality is good and comes with a 1 yr warranty. Installation was easy- but make sure you put them exactly where you want them, because once you stick them on, they are ON for good."
84313,2,"There's definitely a reason why there are so many 1 reviews. I took the chance hoping my experience would be different, something you can do with Amazon's great return policy, and I lost. Installed easy enough, but you key it to the lock position and it's like what almost everyone else said, it still opens, with not much more effort than you would normally use to open it. The product simply doesn't work. If you want security for your truck bed, mine is a 2004 Dodge Dakota SLT Quad Cab by the way, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. My search continues."
120133,1,Bought this as a replacement for my car. Wipes rain away very clean and was super simple to install. Highly recommended!
119452,2,"I received the parts as advertised. Powersport Superstore and Amazon . com have not let me down. Always prompt, always get exactly what I order.Vance & Hines. They offer some of the finest LOOKING exhaust systems. And they have been in buisness for quite a few years.This is what brings me to my point, V&H; have been in the game long enough to know the difference between QUIET and LOUD, UNLESS they have all gone deaf from the error of their ways.TO CALL THESE BAFFLES QUIET or even use the word QUIET in the description has to be in violation of some Fedral Law. Times must be bad and sad for a Co. to have to resort to deception to get sales.If you live and ride somewhere that is enforcing noise Ordinance, DON'T BUY THESE, they are LOUD!!!. They will get you cited. And they make a HARLEY SOUND LIKE a Metric bike at 60, BLAT BLAT BLAT, idle sound, Deep but LOUD."
78853,1,"The carrier is solidly constructed of very sturdy material and was easy to install. I am 71 years old and have respiratory problems but attaching it to the bumper was a breeze, I didn't even have to take an extra breath. I don't know how it will work for heavier objects but for my Yahmaha 2400ishc generator and two full gas cans it is great. The generator weighs 70 lbs and liquid weighs 8 lbs per gallon so I figure the total weight the carrier supports is over 100 lbs and I know it could carry more. I for one heartily endorse this product."
88685,2,The backseat organizer is flimsier than I had hoped. Other reviewers wrote that it sort of flopped around. That's true. I realized that a shopping bag hooked over the back seat would do just a well. (:
37671,0,"like the title says, the driver itself is great and works as it's supposed to. However, the bits are complete junk. they break every time you use them.

170494,2,"My son left his car with me and the battery went dead. I hoped I could use this to get it going, but it didn't happen. I'm not great at using jumper cables. Guess this is good if my car needs a boost in cold weather - we shall see."
81840,1,I found this kit to work exactly as advertised. I used the product to repair 4 large tears and several small rips in an old vinyl covered sofa. The color mix kit worked well and the electric heating iron made the patches permanent and nearly invisible.
155828,1,This is exactly what you see. It is not a exactly a windshield but it stops the wind is light weight and doesn't cost you an arm and a leg. I would buy another when this one wears out. That won;t be soon from the way it is constructed.
15832,1,The Camco RV sewer hose and fittings were exactly what we needed. It fit as advertised and was shipped promptly. It was very reasonably priced.
34924,0,Tank is not the one shown in picture. It is a 50 gallon square tank. If you read the entire discription it says so at the very end.

134958,0,"The product itself is Ok. The Trailer light fit perfectly in the base. The amber markers and reflectors did not come in the package. I had to purchase them separately even thought there were included in the offer. Other than that, the quality of the parts are Ok, but i think wesbar has a better finish in some of them."
118443,0,The terminals don't fit the charger that it is recommened with. Still sitting on my shelve unused; looking for a use.
79719,0,Worked great at first. But almost exactly one year to the day I bought them they're now almost useless. Is that a normal lifespan for wipers? I don't recall ever having to replace them that often. I'm trying a different brand next.
162711,1,I got this online much cheeper than I could buy it locally.It has worked fine since we installed it a mounth ago.
30628,1,"I have used this brand of Octane and so far so good. Lucas has delivered again with a great product, I have used several brands of Octane booster and this one has by far been the best one I have used however it is pricier than most common brands."
179994,1,"I have bought alot of bad boxes in my days of road service, but this one gets my highest grade. I can crank an old 70's clunker until i give up, not the box(excellent cold cranking amps). This power pack will finish the day out with jumping 6 to 8 cars(completly dead batteries or some with no battery) without needing to be recharged for the next days activities. I only charge this unit maybe once a week."
13909,0,"I purchased a number of Mothers products to clean my new car. This polish works okay. I expected it to really buff up the chrome on my car, but it was not quite as good as I thought it would be. That being said, I have only tried it one time and plan to use it again with hopefully better results.I will update my review after using the product several more times."
125996,1,I have gotten compliments on this and it is a pretty heavy duty jacket to boot. Being able to zip it up the way in the picture is great for hot days in the summer. You can undo the two buttons and zip it all the way up for the winter as well. I have owned this for 3 years and it still looks great (no leather treatment yet and I have ridden this in the rain).
123386,0,"This is a decent unit for a laptop or basic AC power needs. My first unit would shut down, or the fan would refuse to turn on. I returned it for a new one, and it's working fine. I would probably get a larger one (400 watt would be ideal) if I could do it again, but for $20 - it was a great deal."
113753,1,"I've been using K&N; oil filters in my Talon and Evo for the past decade, through many different track events. They're very high flowing filters with low pressure drop. K&N; has charts on their website that shows how well they flow in low oil pressure situations, where competitors do not as well. Add to that the easy socket on the end for removal, and you have the best oil filter out there, IMO!No you probably won't notice any differences using this filter over others. It's kind of like peace of mind, trusting and knowing it will perform in tough situations. Don't go cheap on the little things for your car, especially when Amazon offers it for 9 bucks, it's only a few more then the cheapest Bosch's out there."
157642,2,this pos doesnt even have an allen/hex key slot to hold the tie rod end shaft while tightening the nut it has a tiny dimple which no tool can possibly hold .. i tried multiple things including an impact gun and ultimately had to take my car to the shop. POS!
27211,2,"Used it twice and worked fine, stored away dry and safe no batteries for a year and went to use it, will not work.Called AutoXray and they said $76 min charge even after I explained I used it twice and it is still brand new.Real crap if it only works twice and company will not stand behind it.Would not recommend it unless you only eed to use it twice and throw i away, Im tossin this brand new pc of junk in garbage.What a shame and a waste of money.BrianK"
157997,2,"It is no as powerful as a Lightforce or a Warn auxiliary light. Half the cost, though. Looks great in my 4 runner"
52345,0,"Good product. Schematics on the website for my vehicle (2000 Nissan Altima) were incorrect so I had to ad lib. I did get it to work but it would grind when turning the key with the engine already running. Instructions make no mention of an anti-grind relay or how to wire one. After a short google search I found the needed information and wired in my own anti-grind relay. Works good now, wife loves it."
148610,1,it works great - the only drawback is the solar panel is not attached that well since the plastic frame could break if handled rough. otherwise ok. no more battery flashlights for me!
16419,2,I got a REAR MASTER Cover and not the Dress up kit as shown in the picturewhat was in the picture says 3 pc what i gor is 2 oc on the site says fits on all VTX and on the packing says just for Retro
102448,0,Easy fitting with the brackets from my old Memphis fats screen. Less buffetting than the latter but more wind noise.
119981,2,"BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT!!! The packaging notes that it is safe for all wheels, however they neglect to mention that there is a twisted wire that holds all of the bristles in place. If you are cleaning the inside of your wheels, the wire brush will make contact with the wheel and scratch them beyond repair. I now have a new BMW Z4 with 4 damaged wheels as a direct result of using this product. I have contacted their customer service department as well, but no response as of yet. I am assuming that they will be covering the replacement costs."
137117,1,I recently purchased a trailer hitch cover for my Jeep & purchased this lock to protect my cover from theft... My husband really likes it and says that it's very sturdy and that my hitch cover isn't going anywhere!!! He also likes the cover for the key hole. He recommends this lock...
169458,2,This product arrived melted to the package and seems like it just glues the license plate to the car but obviously not heat resistant. I guess I'm gonna have a stereo shop try to install it or hopefully something better.
133616,2,I ordered these floor mats and waited 3 weeks for them only to dicover upon arrival that the two eyelets that were supposed to be inserted in the drivers mat were no present. Had the eyelets been present I would have given this item 5 stars as the mats are very well constucted. Now I have to return the mats and wait another 3 weeks for them to be delivered. That's bogus!!!!
102892,2,By far the most disappointing thing I have ever bought from Amazon.comVinyl itself is very soft and light and flaps around even when you place it on the ground.This cheap piece of viny has a folded edge where you are supposed to insert pieces of supplied garden hose to make the border!!!Do not waste your money on this....please!!
20746,1,"I took 1 star off because I had to get creative with the visor for the rear windows. The piece towards the back end would block the window from closing. I had to spend 20 minutes with a rotary tool cutting off the end into an angle so the window could get past it and close all the way.I would like to note there were a lot of scratches on the visors. One was deep and was white and very visible. I don't know if it was because of the way it was packaged, shipped, or stored."

63871,0,"Beware, the scanner works great but uses a parallel port plug rather than USB to connect to the computer. My computer doesn't even have a parallel port. I did not see anything in the product description to indicate that it used an obsolete connector--so buyer beware. If you're not interested in connecting it to your computer or using the software, it is a great buy. Otherwise, pay a little more for the current model that uses USB."
1528,2,"I've had this UPS for about a year now, and it has become practically useless now..Let me explain:At first it worked pretty good. I would be able to connect a 22"" TV, DVD and a small table top fan and run them for about 1.5 hours.Recently, the batteries die out in an instant, no matter how long I leave it charging.If I connect only the small fan (Which consumes only 40watts according to the LED), in about 30 mins the UPS starts beeping indicating an E01 error. After a minute or so, it shuts down.If I disconnect the fan, and turn it on, the LED says its at 100% charge...! Yet if I connect anything to it again, it starts beeping and shuts down in a couple of minutes!Furthermore, if I connect it to the wall outlet, it indicates it's charging from 90%, and it reached FUL in a few minutes...! What gives??? If it's at full capacity, why the heck is it shutting down??Seems to me that the batteries are faulty and are not retaining charge.I'll also note that this is my second Powersource 400, since the first one died out in a couple of months. During a power failure, it just shut down and would not turn back on. Even when connected to a working outlet.Steer clear from this faulty product. At $300+ you can find much better products out there.P.S. And to make it worse, the online tech support at the website actually CHARGES you for any question you may have...!$35 dollars a pop mind you! Bravo Xantex... You give new meaning to ""Thieves in suits""."

48367,0,"I bought this to replace the exact same model that we had bought in the early 1990's that was made in the USA. It had been through a lot of wear and tear, and after one final drop onto the concrete driveway, it quit working. I still have a service center address I need to check on to see if I can get it serviced.This older model was louder (the only real complaint I have-but it was soooo efficient), and didn't take as much time to fill the air in the tires as this new one.The new one is of course-made in China. It gets the job done (puts air in the tires) but takes a bit longer than the older model.I am using a longer extension cord, and have the ""automatic shut off dial"" set 3 lbs higher than I need so it doesn't suddenly stop in the middle of filling up the tires. I also use a different tire pressure gauge to check the PSI-so I fill the tire, then stop and check the pressure with the gauge. (Instead of reading the air stations dial).Also the valve/nozzle has been very tight to snap on when you clamp it to the tires air valve. With my small female hands I have had to be very careful, as the first time I used it it pinched my thumb in between it and I had a nasty gash. So I've been careful with it since.As with anything though, it has a system that works once you learn it, and puts the air in the tires at home or wherever at your own convenience-which beats going to the gas station to do."

116286,0,"This product is really very simple. It's all squeezing a small amount of clear resin into the windshield chip or crack so that it fills the entire void, and then let the sun's UV rays harden it. The directions are a bit unclear at first reading, but re-reading a couple of times and then watching the online video helped make it clear. I followed the directions exactly, including the ambient temperature conditions which they failed to mention in the product package. My observations:- The amount of resin supplied in this kit is very small, and the opaque plastic tube in comes in makes it impossible to see how much is left (important because you need to have a little left over from the first step, a point the instructions are pretty vague about).- It's hard to squeeze the resin into the well without a little leaking out, but having been forewarned I was prepared to wipe it up and so it wasn't a problem. I didn't have any problem with it leaking out around the sticky pad.- No problem with the syringe suction and pressure steps, and you can watch how it's doing at forcing resin into the voids from the other side of the windshield.- It proved impossible to remove the sticky pad cleanly. Not really a huge problem, just a bit of extra work to clean up all the stick bits left behind.- The transparent cover patch went on no problem, and the resin dried and hardened in the filtered sunlight just fine.- You should scrape off any excess resin layer on top of the windshield with a razor blade after it hardens fully, like they show in the video. I thought there might be problems with that, but it came off cleanly.The end result of all this looked better than before, but not perfect. In addition to a little rough patch left at the center of the former dime-sized chip, the resin failed to completely fill a crack between the layers of glass on one side of the chip. I don't know if that will get worse over time or not.In summary, the kit works more or less, but it takes some careful reading of directions, and the results aren't perfect. They're also a bit too cheap with the quantity of resin."

88895,2,"I ordered this shade a few weeks ago because it's already getting hot in Texas. I didn't start using it until last week though, and my first impression was that it was a really great product that was kind of neat to use. You fold it like a taco shell, twist, and it folds up on itself very neatly and secures with an attached elastic loop. Unfortunately, about the fifth time I used it, the thin wire that runs along the outer rim broke when I was folding it up. I've tried duct, but it doesn't help. The wire keeps poking holes through the shade and the shade no longer folds up. Bit by bit, the wire is working its way out of the shade, and at this point I can't even use it anymore. Don't waste your money. Look for a different product."
176623,2,"I used the Xtreme liner in conjunction with the Dynapad on the floor and rear wall of my truck. I was mostly hoping to dampen the road and exhaust noise, so I didn't apply it to the door panels. The Xtreme is easy to apply and cut. The Dynapad is 1/2"" thick and slightly more difficult to work with. Overall, it's an easy install, but requires some patience. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any results. The noise is just as intrusive as ever. I'm not sure this product is worth the hype."
163407,1,This is exactly what I was looking for. I searched every store in my area and could not find them. I was so happy I was able to find them on-line so purchased two and will keep one as a back up for the future. Thank you Amazon.

140469,1,"Great little scanner. I bought it because of a review on youtube, and it worked perfectly. It told me exactly which sensor needed replacing, and saved me about $400 in dealer repair costs. Everyone should have one, even if you don't work on cars, just to know exactly what is going on in your car. Having a check engine light go one can be a frustrating experience, and it's nice to be able to plug in your scanner and find out what is wrong."

76571,0,"I installed this cover with my 11 year old daughter. The instructions were easy to read and understand although it took us a little over an hour to install. The cover appears to be well made and worth the money spent although there are some issues with the way it was packaged. The side rails were shrinkwrapped together so tight that the foam seal was crushed which is going to let the rain run right in unless some sun and heat allow it to expand back. Also, the rod that holds the front of the cover in place was bent and pushed out of its track so I had to pound it back into place with a hammer and a bolt. If not for these two items I would have rated it 5 stars.The cover fits and looks as nice as any $400+ cover out there. For less than $300 I would say it is well worth it.I have had nothing but good experiences buying from Amazon in the past. The package was delivered two days ahead of schedule."

13464,2,"Bought this withTow Ready 118242 7-Way Replacement Tow Package Wiring Harness, and Amazon suggested that I purchase this bracket - ""buy together"" with that product. The 7-pin plug connector holes do not line up with the bracket holes - the bracket is too small by about a half-inch.I assume it would fit a Hopkins brand harness/plug, but it actually looks different than the picture - the part number is the same but there is a slot on the bottom to pull the wiring up thru.Amazon should not suggest that customers bundle these two items together."

I used only the adhesive squares that come on the back of the emblem and have had no problems with it peeling off.I have to say, though, my devout Christian friends are curious about it...but that may be because it holds a place on the back of my car across from my Darwin Fish.

After clicking for another hours or so, I could see numbers again, better then ever, although still much better at the barely readable angles. Can't say as to its accuracy of course, as I have nothing to test it against that is known to be accurate, but I'm glad it finally works now. Knocked off two stars for all the trouble."

153765,0,"I mounted them to an 05 F250 4WD CCab. Just finished the install in my driveway and they look great and are solid. However, I ended up buying $30 in aftermarket hardware to finish the job. After I installed the first one, I was impressed with the look and function. WHen I tried it out, there was some give and sponginess in the feel of the step. I'm 6'0 and 195lb, so it's not my bulk and girth creating the challenge for the step...I think... I found the spongy feeling unsettling and reviewed and parts included: The 3/8ths bolt kits don't include lock washers and the included washers are pretty small. The included sheet metal screw and their small washers scared me. How can a sheet metal screw be the right fixture for a truck step? So, I brought home a bag of custom hardware that was nice and stout. Put it on with great pain: needed to re-drill the hanger holes and bolted everything to the truck chassis - no screws, glue gun or tape!!! Fingers got destroyed reaching behind the rocker panel to hold nuts and find dropped parts, bit it was worth it. Suckerin' steps are on there like they were TiG-welded. Great hoops but beware of the down-market hardware. Maybe the stock set-up would be fine for someone who doesn't drive alot and is feather-lite."

156143,0,"Basic, black plastic license plate bracket with four identical, galvanized, self-tapping machine screws for mounting frame to vehicle and license plate to frame. Simple and inexpensive; essentially a flat piece of semi-flexible plastic with slots and holes. Performs its essential function. Purchaser should consider the purchase of nut-and-bolt fasteners to attach the license plate as the machine screws extend far beyond the rear of the bracket and will penetrate the bumper surface when the plate is attached. Nothing fancy but after all, its sole function is to attach a license plate to a vehicle. Find an alternative if you don't want to drill holes into the visible face of the bumper."

55916,1,"I recently bought a motorcycle and wanted a sturdy pair of riding boots. I searched online and in stores for quite some time, before finally searching amazon for a nice pair. Hands down, these are the most comfortable, coolest looking, functional, and durable boots I have ever owned.Pros:-They are extremely comfortable, lightweight.-Honestly my first impressions were that I could take a bullet or two in the foot and not feel it! These boots are legit! (I get compliments everywhere on them and people ask me where to get a pair.) -They do NOT hinder the riding ability or take away from the feel of the shifter on the bike at all.-I work on a military base which requires riding boots so I wear them 5 days a week for 8+ hours a day and I don't even know that I am wearing boots at all - EXTREMELY comfortable and practical.-True to size in boots. I tend to wear slightly bigger sizes in tennis shoes however as boots go, sizing is highly accurate.-Easy to take off / put on, don't let the look of the boot intimidate you into thinking they would be a pain to get on and off.-Breathability is extremely well, no complaints there.Cons: No cons really, very well made, most bang for the buck, practical without extreme overkill. Nice features (straps that tighten the top side of the boot for added comfort.) I have owned the boots for about 2 months now, wearing them every day no complaints at all to date!Seriously a very well-made, sturdy, safe, attractive riding boot. Would recommend to anyone and would buy again. They really inspire confidence while riding - sounds funny, but with a sturdy boot like this that is comfortable I do not worry about taking corners, shifting, or putting my foot down anywhere."

124612,1,I had been using this since i was driving my 96 civic. My car kept buring oil even i was using synthetic oil 5w30. Ended up i was using this and it helps to prevent burning oil that quick as before. It also help to lubricate the engine and gears for starts up. Now i am still using it for other cars.
74284,2,I was disappointed to see the product is only the replacement stones. The item description encompassed the honing tool. This is what I was after. A picture of the tool was also advertised. Very poor representation of the actual product. Now I will be shopping locally for the tool and will think twice about ordering anything else from this site. The only plus side is I now have replacement stones for my future tool purchase.- A Gearhead

97104,0,"I bought these bags as a replacement to the OL (leather) frame bags I had bought a couple years ago which I could never get used to the weight of. These are lighter and I dont dread putting the bags on.The only thing is, they are pretty short bags. I mean the distance between the top of the belt and the bottom of the bags is short. It's something that I'll probably get used to but I'm finding it a little awkward to reach into these bags being so high on my belt.Also, if you wear a size 33 or 34 waist pant, get the large not the medium like the fit guide tells you. I'm on the third belt hole with just shorts on and it would be nicer to have more belt extension. It JUST fits in the holder loop so winter it might not. Should have returned it but its such a pain.One more thing. I'm not using that weird single bag they send with it. Not sure if there ever will be a need for it. Definitely not in the back. Maybe in place of one of the side ones when doing a boatload of hand nailing which is never anymore. I put the hammer loop off the old bags on there. Nice to put the hammer in back when walking long distances. Less noise and less rattle. Company should provide that instead of that weird bag that no one would ever use behind them."
88638,0,"If you are looking to replace your front struts at a reasonable price, the Monroe Sensa-trac strut is good, the ride if fine, although you will feel every the road much more. It's not like riding a truck as someone said, but it is harder then the original Volvo struts. The original Volvo struts are double the price of the Sensa-trac strut, so if you looking for a Volvo original ride, get them. If you are ok with a firmer ride and you are trying to save some money, these will do."

172632,2,"A buddy gave me his California Blade because he didn't find it very useful. I used it maybe a couple of times and would have to agree with him. Not only did it not remove all the water like a good chamois does, it left white residue tracks, which I believe were mineral deposits from the hard water as it was drying and became concentrated. It might work for you if you have naturally soft water, or use rain water to wash your car, but if you have hard water, forget about it. If this thing was so amazing, it would have taken over the market from all the chamois type products. All I can conclude is that the glowing reviews you see are from people selling these things."
43989,0,"*****Update*****I have ordered this product two more times since my initial review below. (Yes, it is such a terrific product that I continued to use it despite the problems I had with shipping.) Both times, the order arrived with no problems. It's possible that the leakage problems I had before were a result of ordering the product in the dead of winter, which is a bad time to apply it anyway unless you have a heated garage. I would change my review to five stars, but the review system won't let me.I really gained an appreciation for this product when my windshield cracked and I had to have it replaced with an untreated one. I couldn't believe how much dirtier the new windshield got under the constant spray of road salt. I was glad when the weather warmed up enough that I could treat the new windshield.*****Initial review:I ordered one of these and applied it to my cars. I liked it enough to order two more for Christmas presents. Unfortunately, when we opened one of them, we found it to be leaking. The company was most gracious about sending first one replacement, and then another, both of which were leaking when I received them. The first replacement was leaking badly enough that the shipping container was wet. (Makes me wonder if FedEx knows this company is shipping combustible materials in fragile containers.) The other two leaking products arrived with no visible damage to the shipping containers. Eventually, the company gave up and refunded my purchase price. I am still unhappy because I have one less of these than I wanted.The company claims that it has not had complaints from other customers, but I find that hard to believe given my record of 3 out of 5 defective products. Customers should be aware that the cloth applicator tip should be a uniform beige color when the product arrives. The liquid is sealed inside the applicator in a glass capsule that must be shattered with pliers to release it. Any pink stains on the cloth are signs that the capsule has leaked. Inverting the applicator for a few minutes can cause liquid to appear on the applicator tip. If this occurs, the company should be contacted for a replacement.This is really a great product that lives up to its claims, and as a Clevelander I would like to see this local high-tech company succeed. But the company needs to find out what is causing the applicators to leak and do something about it."
171658,0,its not water proof. it just rained and now my cars soaked. the only reason i bought this was to keep the car safe from the rains while i wait for my back window replacement to come. I'm sad. it fits like a charm and is nice and all that but far from waterproof. and i did expect to see a soft interior but its not lined at all. its just one pice of fabric. inside and out are identical. just to let the others out there know.
140426,0,Works okay but not some miracle product like the ads make it seem like. I used rags to do this by hand and I have a feeling you'll get better results with a power tool. The shine isn't anything to write home about.
79428,0,I used this for the first time today and quickly found out that three hours to warm an oil pan is not enough. I will increase the hours needed until I find the right length of time for a proper warm up. I found it very easy to install and remove and would have liked to had better instructions as to how many hours would be needed to warm oil at certain temperatures. I have high hopes that the product will suit my needs.

28594,0,"This unit is advertised to go to 2200 watts. it cuts off way before that amount, if you are looking to run some motors that may be at the upper end of 1400 watts starting load you may want to consider the next largest unit. I may have to send this back, and I really hate sending things back. Unit works fine for lighter loads and seems well made however."
183332,2,My item arrived with paint scratched off and box the busted wide open in two places! I blame the manufacturer for not protecting the metal or placing anything inside the box to protect it. You basically just get a big empty box with a large heavy item inside the will clank around for the duration of the shipping process! UPS obviously was rough with it but the manufacturer is also to blame for packaging it so poorly. Now I'm stuck wondering if this scratch will rust and if I should send it back and deal with this nightmare again.UPDATE: Now while I am waiting for the replacement to be shipped the price has dropped! The same day they shipped out the replacement the price dropped $15 and Amazon will not honor the difference! All major stores will honor the difference if it occurs within a few days and this drop happened before I even received the item. They would rather waste shipping costs of me returning this item yet again than to provide great customer service. This hitch is large and heavy and I'm sure it's not cheap for Amazon if I return it. It would make more sense to honor the new price than to make me ship it back for no reason. As far as the item itself: Be prepared for a product that is packed without any padding to prevent the metal from puncturing the box. I wrote to Amazon to see if they could package the item better than the factory did so I could receive an undamaged item. It didn't seem like they were willing to help me out there. Pointed heavy metal needs to be wrapped in something so it doesn't just puncture through the too-big-box. This whole transaction has been frustrating and would it kill them to give me the 15 dollars difference for having to wait for a new one to be shipped out and the frustration? The product itself seems quality and I'm going to use the hitch to transport my mom's electric wheelchair. It sucks having to wait longer for a replacement and also having to deal with Amazon's outsourced customer service whom could care less about me or my situation. I really hope the one I receive is in perfect condition and packaged properly!
183583,1,"I have a '97 Accord LX. I don't know much about cars, but hooked up a diagnostic tester after the check engine light (CEL) came on and saw the code P0135. A little online research led me to conclude that the likely problem was an oxygen (or ""O2"") sensor. A little more research led me to conclude that even someone with no mechanical ability (me) could replace this part for a lot less than the $225 I was quoted. This Bosch sensor was a perfect fit, and removing the heat shield and old sensor was a breeze once I applied WD-40 and bought a 22mm wrench. Alternatively, you could buy an oxygen sensor socket, but this sensor is so easy to get to once you remove the heat shield, it's not really necessary. I screwed in the Bosch, tightened (not too tight) with the wrench, snapped in the wires, and was ready to go. I reset the CEL and a few days later passed my state emissions test, which should let me add a few more miles to the 233k she already has. Just as importantly, the car is idling much better now."
124472,2,"I bought these thinking that My truck would ride smoother and get rid of the bounce and pogo effect (2000 Dodge 1 ton Dually). After I installed them I called KYB and ask if they would soften up a bit. They stated that the MonoMax shocks are 40% stiffer than Stock! Enough said. Theses are a BIT harsh for me. If I was hauling 1500# all the time as a True Work Truck then they would work out fine, Not to great without a Heavy load in the bed"
171110,2,"item was exactly as represented...but came folded and rolled in a ""smaller than should have been"" box... haven't put it on yet, am trying to flatten it out... will be getting with a friend who is in graphic design/vinyl business to see if I can still use it."
143876,2,"Ahhhh C'MON!!!!I was going to buy these headlight bulbs - UNTIL I read most of these reviews and checked on some other material.--- 8 - 12 months!That is DEFINITELY not what I'm about to purchase. I've been driving for quite a while and know what is and what is not a bargain. These do not appear to be a bargain (for me).I know Sylvania wants to make a profit but - 8 - 12 months AND they start to dim even before that. I also do not buy the line that one should change out the lights every 12 months. At the ""VERY"" earliest, I would suggest, 'MAYBE,' every 24 months.But it is finally time to change mine out - I've had them in for a little over five years and they are dimming (I've been lucky I guess in the longevity of these bulbs - Honda Accord V6).I am really glad to have read all the reviews and am just not about to shell out for these at this time...."
133624,2,"I just re-read the description, and the above seat cover description is a gross misrepresentation. It incorrectly, if not fraudulently indicates that the covers were customized to fit my specific model. The covers are a sloppy fit, especially on the passenger side, and the controls that are not completely covered are available only through wide sloppy generic openings obviously made to account for any number of general configurations."
51955,0,Great price and love the pic but wish it said BOXER on it. Not everyone can tell its a boxer but I am happy with it. Thank you.
4236,1,GOOD STUFF AND GREAT PRICE. I USE THIS STUFF IN MY GLASS SHOP AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. THIS WAS A GOOD DEAL FROM AMAZON. THE PRICE IN THE STORES WAS A LOT MORE.
42754,1,"I was sort of apprehensive when many reviews I was reading were claiming this product didn't work. so I want out to try it for myself. Well turns out it works pretty good. It does not restore to of the lot shine or luster but it does most of its job. I used it on a corolla and the headlights looked very good but I was not able to remove scratches to the headlight. I also used it on a dodge neon, who's headlights were just this ungodly yellow hue that you couldn't tell if there was a light source inside. Well it did the job on these lights too! I was pretty happy with how the neon's headlights came out because they have been murky for years and at night and during rainy days this makes the headlights look clearer! You gotta rub hard to remove the oxidation but it should not take you more than 15 minutes for one car. I did two cars in 25!"
48465,0,Works well on tires for bicycles and cars. Not so good for bigger inflatables such as rafts or boats.
43587,1,Easy to use. No hassle. Plug and Play. I dont know much about Engine diagnostic but when i bought this tool i was surprised. Fixed my car without guessing whats wrong with my automobile. I highly recommend this for first time user. Get code search data base online research codes to pin point the problem.
35050,1,"I just bought this short ram a few weeks ago. And I am very glad I did. I installed it on my Civic 98 EX Vtec and you can certainly feel the difference. Not a big deal in low revs, and it is not as louder as you may think (this is better for me). But let me tell you the difference at high revs (4200 to red line). Performance is just awesome, you can feel it and hear it. Makes your engine sounds like it has a professional racing filter, I also have installed a header and the high fuel rail from AEM and when vtec opens you can feel this filter doing what it does really well.Installation took me around 15 minutes, very very easy to install (instructions are not very clear and it is a point maybe AEM should try to improve, but not a big deal cause you can not screw up anything at least you don know anything about your engine).I totally recommend this product."
76014,1,"Don't do bearings without one of these. Sooo much easier. You will do a much better, and faster bearing job with this. It will pay for itself."
170458,2,"Initially everything seemed to work fine and I stuck it in my car, never needing to be used. After a few months, I took it out to recharge it. After plugging it in, none of the 4 buttons (on/off, 2 function buttons, LED light button) were responsive. I let it charge for 24 hours at which point the on/off button was still nonresponsive but the 2 function buttons caused a high pitched wailing noise. The LED light didn't work.I unplugged it and checked on it the next day and found that the LED light and the other buttons magically started to work properly. Maybe I could salvage this thing.The next day, none of the buttons worked except for the LED light.I tried recharging it again for 1 day with no change in status. The only button that worked was the LED light. At this point, I realized it was completely unreliable and trashed it.You would think such a simple device would be reliable. You would be wrong. On a positive note, it makes a good doorstop or paperweight."
97756,0,I've had these on both sides of my cargo van for about a month now. The blind spot visibility is much improved. I found installation to be a bit tricky. The clamp on the auxiliary mirror is thick enough that it makes contact with the existing mirror on my van so it will make it harder to adjust it in the future. It seems that over time the auxiliary mirror is dropping a bit - most likely due to the fact that the ball and socket joint is too loose. I intend to caulk the mirror in place when it gets warmer. All in all a good improvement over just the stock mirrors at a price less than it would have cost to completely replace the stock mirrors with a double mirror system mounted on a bar.
109572,0,My husband wanted a charger in his semi to charge the tablet. The charger gets hot when it is charging. He isn't using it at this time. It did a GREAT job of charging but he was afraid it would cause harm to his truck.
104910,0,I use my motorcycle to work a busy field job in NYC. I've used these bags for 2 yrs now. They faded and totally ripped along one side so the bag was hanging away from the bike. I sewed it back along the length of the bag and am still use them daily.
169563,0,"The tool set is very cheaply made. You get what you pay for, since it doesnt cost much. Im wishing I had bought a nicer one though, that might hold up a little longer. Idk how long this one will last."

13724,1,"My office building is freezing, and we are unable to have electric heating blankets/pads due to the fire hazards involved. I bought one of these just to see if it would help me stay warm. It has really made my work life more enjoyable, because I don't have to bundle up with sweaters and blankets anymore. I heat it up a couple times a day, and I'm good to go. Definitely worth buying!!!"
1428,0,looks like a good heavy duty charger. the rectifier was laying lose being held only by the wires. might have been cliped on the bigger heat sink? pluged in and smoked it this gave power to the 12v dc cooling fans. I insalled a older 110 fan and made it work. poor job on the rectifer. they changed from 110v to the 12 v fans because it was cheaper. after this I hope it last as long as my old 30 year charger.
10587,1,"very good deal, great thing to have in the trunk.... I dont exactly know what people mean that is smells bad. the one i have i actually odor free, solid product,,, worth having"

164130,1,"I've had these mats in my truck for a couple of years and they still are almost like new. They are very well made, heavy duty, durable mats. Though they do have deep grooves (and that's a good thing if you are often in mud, as I am), they clean up easily with a brush, some soapy water and a rinse. I highly recommend these mats."
124557,0,"I got this to measure the temperature of my disk brakes and in our server room. On solid surfaces it does good and up close, but from a distance not so great. Seems to be okay for the price though."

164902,0,"I've just received two sets of brake pads. Akebono ACT573 and ACT 914 ProACT. Before I placed the order, it was unclear from the descriptions of each of the products whether a set of pads comes with a pair or with two pairs of pads. Just so I wouldn't have to order it twice I ordered two sets of each. After I have received everything and opened the packages I saw that each set came with two pairs of pads - that is 4 pads in one set. I plan to return the extra sets.I have not installed the pads so have no review as to the quality - will post it once installed and driven for a couple of hundred miles.Also - the shipping was much faster than the anticipated timeline by Amazon."
4555,1,As a 12 yr auto technician I am totally impressed with this item. It gives me at a glance any variable I want to know. I love the fact that it learns by variable (when you fill up you adjust the gallons used).Very nice product for an exremely well suited price!
30899,0,"Bought this for a 1982 Yamaha 650 Seca. Fits properly, but wish it came pre-oiled like other K&N filters. The informational sheet says to use 3/4 of the oil packet, but following K&N's directions to oil every crease, I easily used the entire tube."
64891,1,"This filter is a direct replacement for an '05 BMW K1200R air filter, part number 13717372602. If you check on the parts match it will tell you that it will not fit. This is not the case. Go to the K&N filter cross reference site and you will find that it does indeed fit. And by the way, there is some power gain with this filter and you will be able to hear your intake, provided you have stock exhaust. This filter will not ""seal off"" if you ride in the rain, which I do frequently. Happy riding."
11832,1,Does just what it says it is supposed to do. Easy to use.Super happy with the product and the price I paid.
23050,2,didnt receive the seat cover; got tow hook instead for some reason; called said they were out of seat cover didnt know why they sent me tow loop.
8533,0,"installed these, they work but a little disappointed about the angle of the visor, doesn't match up with the door frame, too acute. ended up following the line for the A frame. upper window part dips down. Also visor material has uneven plastic, and bubbles..., proudly american made. 3m tape works great."
168458,0,"Replaced some ancient Monroe gas shocks with these. While these have greatly improved the ride and handling, I am not certain they are as good as the Monroes when they were new. The Monroes were a lot heavier and had a larger diameter. The KYBs have a detectable jiggle when extended; the worn out Monroes still had no jiggle. Don't know if the jiggle will actually affect performance, but it makes me wonder. It is really hard to compare shocks without having a number of different brands to test on the same vehicle. I would call these good shocks, but not great."
48049,1,"I have had two of these over the years (13 + years full time RVing). Easy to set up and use, cooks even and with minimal flare ups."
16814,2,"The gap was a few inches wide out near the end, very annoying. I actually replaced it already with a refill for the old blade, but that one isn't perfect either.It was difficult to install, but that is because the directions were hard to understand and I was doing it wrong. If it isn't going on easily, try to reinterpret the instructions. There are two different types of hooked shafts."
104640,1,After having spent several hundred dollars with different repair shops trying to diagnose a rough running engine problem I decided it was worth just replacing the ignition coil. The part is easy to replace. Just make sure you label the wires so that you don't mix them up. And there is a small grounding wire that has to be reattached. The only problem is that it is difficult to reach in my car. I had to remove the intake manifold. That took about 30 minutes. Technically you don't have to if you can work in tight spaces. My car runs great now.
2275,0,"I originally wanted a Gates belt tensioner because I heard they were the best ones around. I found out Gates has a lifetime limited warranty on their products but it was up to the retailer to honor the Gates lifetime warranty. Napa wanted $50 dollars for the Gates tensioner with a lifetime limited warranty. I found cheaper retailers but I couldn't find a reliable retailer to honor the warranty. So I came to Amazon and went for the next best thing, a rebranded Gates tensioner with a 1 year warranty. How can I lose? Both this AC Delco and the Gates tensioner look identical and even share the same part number 38104. I waited patiently for this AC Delco tensioner to come in the mail. I was very elated when it finally arrived. I sliced through the little AC Delco sticker seal, opened up the white box, slid out the tensioner, lo and behold I was staring at a Gates tensioner, it even had Gates stamped on to the tensioner. The only thing that differentiate between this ""AC Delco"" tensioner I ordered and the Gates tensioner was the little sticker seal with AC Delco printed on it stuck onto the box. So now I have a Gates tensioner, I mean AC Delco tensioner with a one year warranty.The old tensioner was worn out and I could move the tensioner by hand, but I couldn't do it with the new one. There is no exposed parts on the new AC Delco/Gates tensioner, it uses a coil spring and not a flat spring as the cheaper tensioners use, made in Canada, nothing loose, didn't come with a new bolt but with a piece of paper that said to reuse the old bolt, plastic pulley just as the old one, a box to put the old tensioner in, and a 1 year warranty.I took off 1 star because it came out as a Gates anyways and I took off another star because oscillates a little by like 2 mm as the car is running. I expected it to be like a rock so I wonder if it has a dampener problems. The belt does run cooler and the pulleys are cooler, you can actually touch and hold your hand on them after you shut the car off."
38563,1,"When the directions are followed, works great on bullseye cracks. Less so on other types of cracks, but that's not a failing unique to this Fix-A-Flat kit.Kit is easy to use and resin can be precisely applied."
82598,0,This is an OK product I guess. I found better ones in Advanced Auto after I ordered these.The rear mats are too small and the front mats are a little big for my Camry and it gets in the way of pedals sometimes.
47346,0,I only gave this item 3 stars because the wires were so stiff. I'm not going to cut into them to find out but they feel like solid core wires rather than woven wire. On the other hand the alligator clips seem to be fairly high quality as the teeth all match properly and the spring seems solid and the plastic covers are adequate. The banana plugs work fine too. It's just the type of wire they used that I'm disappointed in.
4892,1,Well it arrived fast in the mail. Its an awesome sticker. Problem is I tend to tape these bumper stickers inside my cars back window and its got a black background and even though the lettering is nice and bright it doesn't show up thru the dark tinted glass on my Rubicon so not sure what i'll do with it!
76269,0,It does what it's suppose to do. This can scratch easily. I bought two and both came with scratches on the mirror.

103976,0,"The biggest disappointment was the fabric wasn't really what I had expected, the fit at the rear window area doesn't fit all that tight (I have a 06 Mustang convertible).The cover will work but I wouldn't order it again, you might be happy with one but I'm just o.k with it.The question is why didn't I return it, the simple answer is, it is what it is and I should have done my home work better....not the fault of the company."

132160,1,"the LED turning light light up bright and nice. the connection with the original socket just require minor adjustment. However, not every car would fit the bulb in, I've tried on my 09 tC, my friends 07 Civic LX, 96 Maxima. And turned out only the 01 Corolla S will fit the light bulb in there.if the original light bulb could barely came out from the socket without any margin, this light bulb might not fit. (For the Corolla S, it fit perfectly and works like charm!!!!)"
36035,2,Don't buy this jack. Not reliable. Will work sometimes but not always. Finaly died after sitting in the back of my car for less than a year. Only used a few times. Cheap plastic parts and gears. Cigarette plug doesn't even fit well and pops out all the time. Control switch is iffy and hard to press. Its a joke and it's not cheap either so don't waste your money.
165358,1,very convenient. not sure magnet was strong enough but because it fit snugly between two panels it was quite stable and the bottle was very useful overall
104788,2,"I have this trailer brake and it worked fine on my small trailer. When I bought a new trailer with 3 axles, you barely feel that it's there. I'm in the process of buying a new one. Anyone recommend a good one for a 3 axle 25k lbs trailer. Thanks."

123737,0,"We liked this carrier because it would store easily when not in use. We took a couple of short one day trips with this carrier without cause for concern. It was 8 days into our big 16 day trip that it started to flap in the wind, delaminating the rubber coating and wearing a hole completely through it. It also began showing signs of the strap anchors ripping away from the bag. I needed to purchase additonal straps from Walmart to ensure that it wouldn't blow right off the roof. My advice to others would be to reduce any excess space in the bag by either strapping it down or stuffing it full. In hind sight, I wish I would have gone with the hard case."

101098,0,"I've been using this product for 4 years now. It's the only product from Meguiar's that my car will tolerate. All other Meguiar's products basically fail on my car because the factory paint is just un-friendly. I like this product, but I've managed to find 5 bottles within a 4 year span that had a different solution in it than what it's supposed to have. Meguiar's Quik Detailer should be white in color. When applied, it should be easy to wipe off with no streaks. The 5 bad bottles I've come across had a blue solution in it and if applied leaves horrible streaks. In order to get rid of these streaks, I had to give my car a good wash and use a pre wax cleanser to remove the streaks plus the light film haze it also produced. In short, when purchasing Meguiar's Quik Detailer just make sure the solution inside is white and not blue."
146627,0,"This license plate ""frame"" is just a bit too small to actually frame my license plate. More accurately, it sits on top of the license plate, and the edges are visible outside the ""frame"" at the sides and bottom. But since no one will be looking closely at my license plate, it's OK. It's pretty, it's shiny, and it's slim so it doesn't cover my tags. Good enough."

After following the directions and repeatedly polishing and cleaning 1-Disc several times, the scratches were not buffed away and the gloss was removed from the game disc. The manufacturer claims that CDs and DVDs are repaired, cleaned and polished but did not do come close to that for me. The 2-stars is that amazon allowed me to return it soon after I recieved it."
148283,0,The seat wrap is nice but is defective. The two straps at front and back of the seat are missing. Also the elastic straps at the top of the back would not allow my seat belt to function properly since the belt is attached to the corner of the seat. Rather than take a couple of weeks for return/replacement I modified it myself. First cut the elastic strap and plaed it under the seat belt and simply re-tied it in a knot. Next poked holes in the wrap inside the edge binding and placed strings behind the seat and under the front of the seat. Works fine so far. The cloth seats on my GMC pickup were hard to slide my butt on so the sheep skin makes it easier to get in and out.

Also, because we took too long looking for a way to use the blades we were too late to return for a full refund. This if you buy from Amazon. We bought some blades from Auto Alley and they took back the blades with no issues. So watch where you buy the blades from and don't expect them to fit even if you know the size you need."
19663,1,I don't have a chance to try the glass breaker but I hope that I won't have the chance forever. I just kept it as a preparation. Wish everyone a long and prosperous life. But I got to say its design is smart. It won't break regular glass nor human body:) it is safe to put it with the key.

127692,0,"You don't get what you buy in this photo, which is really weird in my opinion. So part of my rating is that.Otherwise, it's a decent tool. I doubt it works too well, and I doubt it is terribly accurate. Gets the job done with the ease that a normal stick tool can't do."

121393,1,"Great buy! The pumice soap works well; I primarily use it to remove grime after working on my bicycle. The 64 ounces is a good value at this price. The hand pump is a little finicky, but works well enough...still a 5-star product."
96249,0,"Last year I bought one of these for the driver's door and was surprised to find that the open/close direction is now reversed. That is, press the button for down and the window goes up. Recently the passenger door regulator broke, so I looked up the previous purchase and bought this one. I suppose I should not be surprised that the passenger door regulator exhibits the same reversed motion. I inspected the power connector very carefully - there is NO way to accidentally plug it in backwards, so the motor wiring must be backwards."

26915,1,"The K&N Replacement Filter for the Road Star is a medium difficulty shade tree mechanic task. I call it medium only because the Road Star's filter box is not the easiest to remove and most people will need a long-nose plier to get the breather hose off the back of the filter box. The K&N filter has well over twice the ""breathable"" surface area of the stock Yamaha filter and the oiled fabric of the K&N flows a lot more air per square inch than the stock paper filter. The difference is immediately noticeable at idle - the bike no longer feels like it's gasping for breath as it idles. The difference is even more noticeable when riding - the bike pulls harder and smoother from idle all the way through the power band, accelerates more crisply, and doesn't surge like the stock filter did. For riders who keep the stock exhaust or go with a moderately higher flow after-market system, the K&N Replacement Filter offers all the air flow needed. I've used K&N for years and will always replace the stock air filter with a K&N when one is available."

120844,1,"I purchased a K&N air filter for my Ford Explorer (2002 model, 4.6 V-8) --there was an increase in power and gas mileage -- which led me to buy the model 59-3364 flame arrestor for my boat (5.7 Volvo V-8). It replaces the factory model which has much smaller surface area. I won't know until I use the boat if I receive the same benefits as I did with the Explorer, but from talking to other owners, I should receive about a 5% increase in horsepower and gas mileage -- which will easily pay for the unit in a year."
18701,0,The product was ok I didn't expect anything fancy since the price is cheap. but the quality is good I rate it 7/10
93954,1,"A couple of tips. The shorter you make the braided wire, the better. You're going to build up heat by using a back and forth motion on the sealant, and you will see your wire slowly move up the lip of the widow. Getting the hold started to feed the wire in was pretty difficult. The insertion tool (with handle) that comes in the kit was succesful in getting the wire through ONCE I had created a hole to insert it. This is a very slow going and labor intensive process. Be sure not to drag the wire across the sheet metal, you WILL gouge it and cut in to it. I would recommend calling around to see how much it would take to remove the glass, because at $45 for a little bit more you could have a professional do this for you."

The rotors were a good price and should last a while before we need another set."
163026,2,"I am very disappointed with Amazon, my favorite online shopping center, as far as this alarm is concerned. I did not order this particular alarm, so I was rather shocked when I opened the box and saw the unit.Nevertheless, I decided to keep it and give it a try. After installation it worked well until it rained and water wet it. Thereafter, it would beep once, twice, three times, then produce an embarrassingly distorted sound, which indeed attracted curious onlookers, all for the wrong reasons.This alarm has 2 wires-red and black-emerging from its body (nothing like what I had seen on amazon and ordered).The display on Amazon does not look like the one that was sent to me. I certainly would not recommend the unit that Amazon shipped to me in error-I suppose-that is, the one with the two wires.I am so ashamed of the sound from this device that I have removed it completely from my vehicle. I need a good quality, weather resistant and reliable reverse beeper to enter certain premises.So, here I am, once again on the market for a good reverse beeper.Hoping for a steady, consistent and pleasing tone from a new beeper.Best wishesHenry."

185456,0,"It was fairly easy to get on my seats with a little help from another person. O.K. product, BUT when putting the clips on one of the cords broke. This happened when running one of the cords underneath the seat (per instructions) to attach on the front of the seat cover. All in all - it's O.K. but I now have to readjust the seat cover when I get in and out of my car (which is a pain). Design concept was good.

47455,2,"I followed the charging instructions for the Power Pack 300 C. After 48 hours of AC charging, the light was still amber instead of green. The manual said, if the light was amber, wait 15 mins and press a button on the unit that would reveal the charging level. I did this and the unit said it was fully charged. The Power Pack ran a 40 watt table lamp for 4 hours as promissed!However the next time I charged the system the same thing happened. The light was Amber. After waiting 30 mins I pressed the button on the unit but this time it registered ""RED"". I moved the unit to another outlet and charged it for another 48 hours. Same Result (RED)! I plugged in the 40 watt table lamp and it lasted only 20 mins.I love the idea Xantrex had for a portable electronic generator, however their execution came up a little short on this one. The unit is going back!"
182644,1,This little air compressor takes up very little space and took me from 28-35psi in 30 seconds for each tire. The carrying case is very handy and fits everything in there without any force. Package came with a tire guage and attachments to inflate bikes and mattrasses. No regrets here; beats waiting in line at gas stations for air.
129870,0,Top down oil change is a life saver with the cars in our household. The Mityvac works well but there is a lot of pumping required to draw a vacuum and remove all of the oil. I wish i had ordered the version with the compressed air attachment.

These leather wipes streaked the car leather so bad I could hardly get it off once it dried. In fact, the only thing that would remove the streaks was their cleaner. Live and learn, not all Meguiar is good!"
55801,1,"I've bought bra's for just about every vehicle I've ever owned to safeguard from love bugs here in Florida. I bought one for a 2002 Saturn. Looks good on the car, the attachments for the fenders were different as the saturn has push pins so no clips, luckily has stayed in place, though I was doubtful. Only gripe I have is that one side doesn't line up, no matter what you do, how many times you take it off etc, so left side lines up with the hood, right side is up about an inch (and no you can't bring it down)."
40553,0,"I've found these tailbone pads to be a real help - especially as I have an uncomfortable car seat and a long commute. This one is well made, so far as using it daily for about a month and a half goes. The one thing I wanted to say is that the pad is not as thick as some others and the foam is not a high density foam, so it squishes pretty much. I find this acceptable on my office chair, but not so good in my car."
52541,2,"I was so excited to purchase two keys for $200, but I guess it's true when they say you get what you pay for. One of the keys broke 2 days after getting them programmed.

Keyless in Florida :0("

When one tries to lower the vehicle, it drops like a ton of bricks, there is no slow to it I have tried over and over but it goes from 0 to 50 in no time flat. I returned to the store. This was my second torin Jack, I guess I never learn. I realized it was bad design when I used my friend's 3 ton jack and it lowered so slow that it was hard to tell it was lowering. I do not recommed buying this jack unless you are looking to sue the company because eventually you will."

After exchanging the air filter, adding Castrol Power 4 RS racing 10w40 full synthetic and a K&N; oil filter, the bike came alive. It's fine now! I can feel it in the trottle.Shipping was really fast!!"
35402,1,"I really like this helmet, just be warned: for me it seemed to run a little large, I normally wear an XL so that is the size I originally ordered, but had to return it for the Large. The XL was just a bit too loose and I have a pretty good sized noggin. So if you are like me and prefere your helmet a little more snug than loose, order one size smaller than you normally would and you should have a perfect fit. Other than that, love the fit, the look and the feel; an all around comfortable helmet. I would recomend."
163378,1,"This is a great product if you don't want those velcro things attached to your windshield forever. The shipping was fast and free. I tried to find this locally, and couldn't find it, must be a hot item. I definitely would recommend this."

115924,2,I have to second the last reviewer. The bits have to be pried out of the box and it gets annoying after a while. I threw it away and replaced it with a case where they are held loosely.
60099,2,"I ordered the floor liners for front and back of Toyota Camry 2009, priced high, poor fit and the customer service is a joke. I was instructed by Email on different ways to Jerry Rig the mats to get them to fit right. From turning them inside out and placing a brick on them to reshape, to placing them out in the sun for 48 hours. The mats are puckered on both sides. Finally they sent me a new front set, they fit for about three hours and then they were puckering too! Funny they also sent me a few strips of velcro to keep the puckers out, maybe they have had this problem before, you think? Please think twice before purchasing this product."
19701,1,"I've always wanted one of these, just in case. I love the fact this is on a key chain. It is right in front of you in the event you need it. The size is good, it doesn't get in your way."
3058,0,"Unlike the factory paper element, the K&N air filter has rubberized edges. This makes closing the air filter box more difficult as the rubber is thicker than the paper plus the rubber has little ""give"" to it. For my particular application on a Toyota Sienna mini-van, the trouble was mulitplied due to half of the filter assembly was located underneath the windshield overhang. I ended removing the entire filter housing and ""set-up"" the filter using a clamp to lock down the cover so the filter would be compressed for final assembly. After compressing for several hours, the reinstall was fine."
115208,0,"These wires are excellent. This particular application does not work well though. The boots are too long for this car. The ""6"" cylinder plug boot sits against the leading O2 sensor. Additionally all the wires are too short to route the same way as the factory wires. The shortness is most noticeable in the front cylinder bank. May want to rethink these wires if you intend on using them on a gm 3800."

59977,2,"I don't know if the one I got was perhaps a defective run, but they didn't work at all. They had hardly any tar in them. I tried 4 of them, and on every one, air would just come up rapidly through them and come out the two ends that were coming out of the top of the tire. They were completely unlike others that I have used that were very tar-filled, so much so that they are rather difficult to get out from between the two plastic sheets that they came between and leave a bit of tar behind on those plastic sheets. These Slime ones left no tar at all and didn't seem to have much tar in them at all. I returned this pack of Slime plugs and bought a competing brand instead which worked perfectly as expected."

156131,0,"The Mass Air Flow Sensor on my Ford f150 had a crust of dirt. I use this product to try to clean it but could not. I had to use heavy duty degreaser and a small brush to remove dirt, then rinse with water, wait until dry and ready.I only clean the sensor electrodes with degreaser with a small brush, very carefully. Do you think the air is very soft and delicate?, the air erodes the rocks of the mountains. Sensor electrodes withstands some degreaserI know this procedure is not correct but to me it worked, you just have to let it dry and will not have any problem."
92514,1,What I like about this filter besides the added performance is the fact that it is reusable. That means you never have to buy another filter again. It is also covered by K&N; 1 million mile warranty. I would suggest going on K&N; website and filling out the warranty form (left side on their site close to the bottom click on warranty then scroll down to the bottom and click on the form link) just in-case you might want to be covered by the warranty. They suggest cleaning the filter every 50k miles that also depends on your driving conditions. I useK&N; 99-5050 Filter Care Service Kit - Squeezeto clean my filter.

The interval between oil changes as determined by the on-board computer is about 10,000 miles and when I check the oil in between it always looks clean. Your car is worth thousands of dollars, don't skimp on cheap motor oil, get this."

106574,1,"So even after seeing the reviews stating the hardware was not long enough i decided to order it anyways as i don't mind taking a trip to the hardware store.The issue is that the plastic insert that expands when you screw in the plastic screws are not long enough,so i took a trip to my local hardware shop and found some 11/16th plastic screw type automotive fasteners....i had to use metal screws in place of the plastic screw to get this to work and had to cut the ends off the outer faster as the hood in that area is to shallow..but after $2 and 40 minutes i got it fastened and looking good....would be five stars if the hardware was legit out of the box."

The annoying engine whistle, that my car used to make at high RPM when entering highway, is gone, and the throttle has noticeably improved that I don't need to harshly push the accelerator pedal; therefore it improved gas mileage. It's definitely a good buy for any car that needs the air filter changed."
132477,0,"The thing is nice once you get it installed. The fact that it is so nice offsets the bitter taste left after a long installation process. The box touts &quot;Easy Installation&quot;. Really it was not a terrible experience, but my expectations were way off. I just kept thinking, &quot;Easy!?&quot;. My particular vehicle required extra relays for the door locks to work as well as an extra relay for the dome light feature. Also required were resistors and some soldering. By reading the feature list, you are led to believe that the system performs these functions right out of the box. Not necessarily true. Good system but more honest representation to the consumer would be appreciated. There were some errors and contradictions in the installation literature. But if you're familiar with electronics you can navigate through. Just set your expectations on the conservative side (regarding the installation) and you will be OK. I would not recommend attempting the installation unless you have some prior experience in similar projects. As mentioned above, the system does appear to perform nicely."

Maybe given time it will get that big but not near that now."
143054,1,The original blend air door and door actuator were broken on my minivan when I bought it 2 years ago. My mechanic was gracious to give me the item names of the broken parts I needed and the cost buying them online was a fraction of the dealer cost. My mechanic said this item with the black housing had metal gears inside which were far better than the plastic gears in the original part on the van. It was a great find and my heat/air is 100% functioning now.
