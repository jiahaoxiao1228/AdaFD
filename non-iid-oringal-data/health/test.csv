205568,2,"SC Johnson makes the worst plastic wrap on the market today.The roll is wrapped so tight you can't pull it out of the box without the box falling apart.The tabs on the end of the box are supposed to be pushed in to hold the roll in place while you try to pull some out.The tabs were designed by an idiot. When you push them in the whole box falls apart because the folds in the box are in the way of the tabs.If you scotch tape the ends after destroying the box they still don't work.The wrap itself does not stick to anything. I have tried it on pyrex glass bowls, ceramic bowls, plastic bowls.They spent a fortune designing the box to get your attention but that is all you get.This product deserves a class action suit. Absolute garbage. Bordering on commercial fraud."

69008,0,I think cayenne extract great kick-starter to get nutrients from supplement in my system fast.On a cold day I could use cayenne extract in food or drink for a quick body-warmer.I have used Dr. Christopher's cayenne extract for years but recently discovered its many uses and benefits.
390912,0,Love the concept of precut walkerballs but the precut area was too small even for a duro-med walker...Had to make bigger...Did have a snugger fit (when compared to tennis balls that you cut on your own) which may prevent them from falling off which has been more of a problem than wear. Received on time.
226910,0,I used to use this but i dont know if they changed the formula because it stopped working. I switched to psoriatrax.
202077,0,I thought this product was just okay. I don't like the smell and the fact that I have to wear gloves to apply this. I ended up not using it as much as I planned because of the chemical smell.
351168,0,"After reading some of the other reviews I was a little disappointed, I guess I was expecting too much. It did what it said, it rinses out the nasal cavity. I guess my congestion problem is not in the nasal cavity."
43371,2,"Very flimsy, have to use 3 or 4 at a time for absorbancy, more the size of 2x2 than 3x3."
169246,0,"For the price this is a great creatine. If you take it with water it is tasteless. Of course at the bottom of the drink you're going to get a little chalky-powder taste. If you put something in water, it is no longer......just water. I put in whey too and it worked great. I've tried allllllllllllllllllll kinds of creatine and this is definitely one that made me break out. Not really on my face, but my chest/stomach/ and back. After about 2 weeks I think I could read braille on my back. Now I know that creatine is notorious for this, but this is the worst case I've had from a product."
341468,0,"I like the product because my gut has no problem since using it. The reason that I give only 3-stars because every time I count the number of Vcaps in the bottle is only 26 or 28, supposely 30 per bottle label. This happens 4-months in the row since I am a monthly subscriber. I believe that the manufacturer did it with a good reason...HIGHER $ PROFIT! Amazon should reflect this complaint to the manufacturer company, otherwise Amazon's reputation would be hurt badly. Other consumers should verify the quantity after you receive/open the bottle."
208742,0,It served the purpose but not nearly as good as the one I've had for years. Didn'tseem to be as stiff plus the bristles broke easily.
284932,1,"I have PCOS and irregular periods an we're TTC. I bought this hoping I could determine my fertile days better since it is a lot cheaper and cleaner than ovulation test strips. At first I wasn't taking the lens off the holder part and wasn't getting a result and was confused, then I actully re-read the directions and looked at the picture the have of how and where to put your saliva. Anyway, It worked. I actually discovered that I was fertile on CD9 (lots and lots of ferning/crystalization patterns, which they give you a diagram to read the results), crazy, so hubby put on his glasses and gave it his best shot! HAHA! It's only been about 1.5 weeks, but at least now thanks to this I can tell when I ovulate and am fertile. I would SO recommend this for others TTC especially with irregular cycles."
417435,0,"I used the Rembrandt Low Abrasion Toothpaste for more than a week, and found that my teeth felt clean. However, it didn't remove my stubborn stains. My unstained teeth appeared whiter, though. The stubborn stains will probably require a trip to the dentist. I believe the Rembrandt toothpaste would be ideal for maintaining your teeth's whiteness after having them professionally polished and for that, I can recommend it."
261442,0,"My daughter has been taking this for a few weeks now to help improve energy and endurance. Her muscular weakness condition makes many activities hard for her to do. She has reported, and I have observed, some small improvements in her abilities since she began taking this product. The results are very individualized (I know others that have tried this amino acid), so you won't know the affect it will have on you unless you try.I also tried Tyrosine (not the acetylated form, though) and found that it made me more alert late in the day and especially at night. I could not fall asleep until late at night, had lucid dreams, and woke very easily. I got limited sleep while taking Tyrosine, but I DID NOT feel tired. I think the effect of being more alert results in the perception of more energy, which results in being more active, which can have a positive impact in many ways. Try it an post the result you observe!"
111146,0,The product works as it says. It provides great support for your posture. The part that sucks is you must wear a full t-shirt to avoid the material from rubbing against your skin.
146444,0,Guess I should have read all the information prior to buying. You are tied to a cord because there are no batteries. It works.
147208,1,I like these pads. They absorb well and keep me feeling dry. I'll probably buy them again.
79878,0,"After using Norelco razors for over 40 years, I was disappointed when Norelco recommended that the shaving head should be replaced once a year. Earlier Norelco razors provided much longer service. The shave was satisfactory for a while, but deteriorated over time. This rechargable razor does not stay charged as long as former ones, running down in about a week, compared with three weeks earlier. If Norelco claims to have improved their razors, I wish they would go back to their former ways. If I can get some assurance that a new shaving head would provide better service, I might invest in a new head. Otherwise, I might be better off spending the money in a different brand."
360220,0,"These are great for everything .. shower,partys,massages,intimate times.The Batterys 3 AAA will last forever easy to change the batterys easy to clean ...But the only problem I've has is the Wires Break easily in the fingers so its like a 5min chore for each hand to get them on and off with out breaking them .. plus they come with NO WARRENTY so if they break your SOL.."
17601,0,"I received this as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago. My brother in law requested the same trimmer this year for Christmas so I was happy enough with it to give it to him.PROS:- Can sculpt and trim pretty well around the face and cheeks.- Adjustable trimmer height options give you the trim length you wantCONS:- The battery starts to go haywire after a year- Can't plug and trim. In other words if the battery dies you can't plug the thing in and continue to use it (not sure why)- Trimming around the neck is pretty hit or miss. It's cut me a couple of times, but not often.Because of the battery life and lack of ability to plug-in and trim I docked two points. But as I said, it was good enough for me to buy for my brother-in-law so it really isn't that bad."
160646,0,"I found the wax kit is very useful. The Warmer is good. Only issue is the wax. It takes the hairs off nicely but it's sticks to your skin so badly that it took me few days to get completely off my skin. I rubbed my skin with baby oil for so many time still there was residue. And worse part was removing it from my tiled floors, almost impossible. I rubbed my floors with baby oil several times. I have used wax before and they can be cleaned easily with water."
421468,2,"I have yet to get an accurate reading with this awful thing. It varies, like everyone else said, by a difference of about 4 degrees which is ALOT if you've got a sick infant - it could mean the difference of a hospital visit or just using tylenol. save your money and buy a product that you know is more reliable and not a guessing game!!"
358210,0,"This blade works as intended, cuts well and is definitely a notch above the $20 blades you buy at WalMart. I did run into problems when I wanted to start using a shorter height blade (0000 and 00000). The minimum length with the Fast Feed is 000 and it does not accept replacement blades.So.... I decided to upgrade to theOster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipperand I would recommend this to anyone who shaves their head frequently. It uses a completely different and much more powerful motor than all the other clippers out there. The blades on the Oster 76 are detachable so you need to buy the 0000 and 00000 blades separately for about $20 each. It is a lot more expensive, but worth it, in my opinion."
331207,1,"My parents kept one of these in my room when I was very young, and as an adult, I stumbled across one online. It works just as well as I remembered. Make sure to put in in the middle of the room or at least across the room from yourself for best results. Play with the tone and volume to cover up whatever you're trying to cover. I'll have one of these in my room forever!"
410312,0,The product is good - it produces a nice fragrant vanilla scent in the room that you place the reed diffuser in. The packaging that it comes in is pretty shabby. Many that I ordered arrived broken as they were only shipped in a flimsy plastic container.Other than that I am pleased.
378240,2,This is worst tub I have ever seen/used. It leaks worse than I could ever imagine a tub leaking. I haven't had to mop my bathroom floor since buying this tub because we're always cleaning up large amounts of water. Finally now that money isn't tight I have thrown the thing in the trash and bought a new one that is one piece.
39981,0,"I had hoped that this supplement would allow me to get away from taking levothyroxine (Synthriod). It didn't work out that way, but I have to admit that, for the fist 6 months, the condition of my hair, skin, and nails did improve. My nails were stronger and less brittle, and my hair was fuller and softer than it has been in a while. Oh, and I was able to lose some of the weight that the Synthriod packed on! My doctor has me back on Synthroid again, but I am considering getting more of Gaia's TS and trying a smaller dose (one a day or every other day) to see if it will have the some of the same results, even while taking the regular medication. I've read good reviews from people who say they were able to avoid going on a thyroid medication by taking this. For me, I think that the results were very promising, but I had already been on the med too long to be able to quit effectively. If you're not on a thyroid medication yet, but your doctor has suggested it, you might try this for a few months, first."
182740,0,"I purchased the Tweezerman Shaving Brush to go along with my new Edwin Jagger safety razor. This is my first foray into wet shaving and I admit that I didn't want to spend a lot on my first shaving brush in case it didn't go very well.The Tweezerman brush is a solidly-built product. The badger hairs are glued to the stand and hold a good amount of water when used. I don't have any other experience with shaving brushes, but I am guessing that this brush is probably on the rough side (you get what you pay for). Overall, I have enjoyed the wet shaving experience and the Tweezerman brush is a pleasant part of the overall experience. Having said that, I am sure that I will eventually want a more expensive, softer shaving brush.In the meantime, I will continue to use the Tweezerman brush. It seems to get a little softer with each use. It shed quite a bit of hair at the beginning, and that is tapering off somewhat. Again, there are some drawbacks to this brush, but, overall, I don't regret getting it. It does its job reasonably well. I knew that it wasn't a luxurious brush when I bought it and that is precisely what I got."
49515,1,I got what I expected - what can really be the surprise with pills. Yes the pills were in the bottle.
158980,0,"It's good. Far from great. Features are nice. Takes FOREVER to charge initially. Why doesn't it just come with at least a half charge? Retarded. The trimmers work nice. Everyone else is correct, not a close shave, but if you wanna be Don Johnson circa 1987 - it works great! It's the damned lack of a charged battery at purchase that drives me nuts, rest is acceptable, especially the price."
119058,0,"I had higher expectations for this new toy based on the other reviews I saw. It's ok, but just isn't as powerful as I was hoping for. It does get the job done, but not in a mind-blowing way like I was expecting. Probably just a matter of getting what you pay for."
351448,0,Product works okay but not as well as whatever the lady at the spa used for my pedicure there - or maybe it's just easier to use it on someone else's feet than it is to try and do your own?
421665,0,"I really wish Seventh Generation Paper Towels were scored down the middle of the 9"" X 11"" sheets like the Brawney ""Pick-a-Size"" towels are. I can see huge benefits to the environment if people could easily pull off just half sheets at a time which is really all we usually need."
213142,0,was hoping for a better taste and easier mixing. Very hard to get this without chunks. I think I will invest in the mixer as well to see if it helps
386720,2,"i've taken this on and off for a year now - no change in anything. no change in monthly cycle - no pregnancy --- it don't think it hurts to take it, but no change here."
11341,0,Pretty nice kit but the bag is stuffed to capacity leaving no room to add anything at all
403888,0,"I got these batteries because of the price, but I found the battery life is not so good. They look new but I'm not so sure...."
68048,0,"My experience trying the chocolate flavored Balance Bars was one I don't care to repeat! I followed the instructions on the package to drink a glass of water with the bar and the water was the only way I could swallow it! The taste of the bar was very chalky and dry and truthfully, the thing almost made me gag! In all fairness to the product, it did keep its promise to satisfy my hunger and sustain my energy, but unless they can find a way to improve the flavor, I'll never touch another one! If you can stomach the taste and texture, than it may work for you, but I don't recommend this particular flavor of Balance Bars. Perhaps another flavor would be better."
7866,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
325813,2,The pill kept sticking to the sides of the pill chute and wouldn't get into the mouth even when we practicall tipped it upside down. The pill stuck to the sides and didn't work. Even when we wet the pill first it still stuck and all the liquid would go in the mouth but the capsule stayed in the chute. Very disappointing for the price!! I wish I just bought the 4 dollar competitor product instead :(
34504,0,"I am 39 years old but very petite, I wanted to find an electric toothbrush to do a better job at cleaning my teeth (I was using a manual toothbrush before). All of the other toothbrushes that I looked at had a very large head or were super expensive. This toothbrush is very inexpensive and has the perfect size head. I could tell the difference in my tooth and gum cleanliness within two days of using this product.On the downside, it doesn't last very long - I have gone through 6 of these in a two year period already. Battery area conductor falls apart, etc. But, at this price, I have no problems just buying a new one. They do sell this product at Target, but they don't sell the refills there! I have no idea why - I ordered the refills here on Amazon."
371412,0,not as well as I had hoped for compared to the paste which works wonders on brass...the paste works 10x better and the stainless polish really doesnt work as well as other products i use.
419487,0,"I've had chronic sinusitis for years and tried this last year. Perhaps I simply didn't use it consistently enough to see any clear results. This is not to say it isn't effective. After a prolong bout of bronchitis, nasal and chest congestion this year, I tried something called SinuCheck. It has a ""special"" version of only one component of Gelomyrtol - eucalyptus oil. By the second day, it seemed to really do the trick for both nasal and lung congestion and it is considerably cheaper and easier to find in the US."
145711,0,"This product does remove hair, and it does hurt. I would never dare to use it on my under arms or anywhere but my legs. It does leave hair soft, but still there. You will never be able to get the same silky soft legs that you can with a razor.I would recomend this if you have high pain tolerance and thick hair, but personaly for me I don't like it. (Although my friend uses it on her chin all the time and absolutly loves it)"
287210,0,"I use nitrile gloves for working on the car, cleaning the house, polishing my shoes, and too many other things to list. They're ideal when you just need to avoid getting messy. 480 pairs is an awful lot of gloves, but this lets me put boxes all over the house, so they're always at hand, so to speak: a box in the garage, another in the workshop, one under the bathroom sink, and so on. The bulk deal here is the best price I've found on these.Update, August 2010: After using these for awhile, I've found that they're actually not the same as the more expensive nitrile gloves. They tear very, very easily, often without any obvious provocation. If you're working with something toxic or using them in a medical setting, put on a double pair and watch them closely, so you can replace the outer pair as soon as it rips. I've downgraded them to three stars - they're still a good bulk buy for general household use, but they're not quite the bargain I originally thought they were."
381260,0,"not much to say, fit nicely. recommended by our chiropractor. now i have to come up with four more words required for the review"
291873,0,The directions included are not as clear to understand as they could be about how to position the sphygmomanometer.
153188,0,not a bad plastic panty for the price it is a good deal.Hand wash and hang to dry they will last awhile....
286513,0,This is a flavor that might work for some but to me it was middle of the road. It was ok but not the best flavor they have. Then again taste is subjective.
285277,0,"best battery life in a shaver.i use an electric shaver only 1-2 times a week as i perfer a blade but i have had this for 2 years, and battery is still strong with no memory problems. you can shave while its charging.the foil did recently brake, and cost as much as new to replace.however it never got a close shave, and would occasionaly pull hair even when new, you would have to work it hard to get more than a marginal job."
299566,0,Tastes good. I only ordered one bottle and it recommends that you take the product for a minimum of 2 months. I didn't notice feeling any differently because of taking it but I finished it in a week or so I think. So you would need to buy 8 bottles. But from my research I know its good for your body so it definately didnt hurt. It may have helped me internally but I just dont know it yet.
104437,0,"Purchased this for a friend. reading the description it sounds alot bigger than it really is. No jumper cables, the strobe didnt work had to put in new batteries. shovel was kinda difficult to put together and flimsy. bag is just over stuffed. not easy to put things back into bag and close it once its opened."
387675,0,"I'd like to say that I'm an avid athlete, having played collegiate basketball. I bought this product, hoping that it will improve my running durability, not so much my vertical jump. I have to admit that so far I have only used the insoles to for my morning 25-35 mins runs, and frankly I can't say that my runs feel lighter. I would have expected to be less tired and much fresher when i get done running, but that's not quite the case for me. I will probably start balling pretty soon /once i feel in good enough shape/, so I'm secretly hoping the insoles are going to give me an edge on the court in terms of quickness and stamina.So, I can't really say whether this product is a success or not, as it has not done the trick for me. I'm in somewhat good shape, but I know I can be ever fitter, and I was expecting this product to help me make my runs longer and more intensive. I'd be satisfied, if it works fine on the basketball court, but that remains to be seen!"
27830,0,As a general rule protein shakes really do not taste good and this is no exception. I really expected a much better shake after reading the reviews about how good this shake was. I ordered the double rich chocolate and it had no flavor and was incredibly watery. No better or worse than any other shake on the market I just had higher expectations after reading some of the other reviews.
230005,0,"I debated between this and the Emjoi Optimax. I wanted something that would do facial hair and legs. I bought this one because it had better reviews and was half the price. I am here to tell you it works as promised, but it hurts. It does get more tolerable after awhile, but it still hurts. If 3.5 stars were available I would give it that, because it does get most hair in a couple passes, but I cannot give it 4 stars because it hurts too much for me to use it regularly. If I find I get used to it, I'll upgrade my rating."
378980,2,"I registered for this without really thinking things through. I have been disappointed with the quality of the items. We had to use the medicine dropper when our son was only 2 weeks old, and it's very difficult to use. If you don't get the medicine dosage right the very first time, it's almost impossible to adjust it. Way too much air gets trapped inside. Additionally, it's hard to clean. As for the bulb syringe- use the one you get from the hospital. It's soooo much better. The themometer is accurate, but it doesn't beep!!! I got very frustrated trying to take my son's temperature under his arm. He was crying, and I had to keep staring at the small digital screen as well as hold him down.The nail clippers are okay. I do like how they have a rather ergonomic handle.Instead of buying a kit, buy what you need separately. You'll pay more, but you'll get a better product."
188828,0,The unit shipped to me did not look like the one pictured. It had masage wheels that were in the handle and not on the outside as pictured. The unit is splintery and need sanding before use. Would be a great product if you didn't have to perform maintenance on it before you used it.
274628,0,"I bought this just as a copper bracelet. I couldn't care less, or believe less, in the ""healing properties"", and hence won't be reviewing them.I have tiny wrists, and even after overlapping the ends this bracelet is too large. When I adjusted it, the bracelet didn't bend uniformly (though I was fairly careful) and therefore is misshapen: hence the docking to 3 stars. The size (and resulting bending) wouldn't be a problem for larger-wristed folk, but they can write their own reviews. It's a perfectly fine copper band. Nothing fancy, a nice thickness, and a fine sheen (without being gaudily shiny). It also didn't discolor my wrists, which is nice. It seems a bit expensive for just a plain copper band, but all the other copper bands I looked at were more expensive."
14806,0,"I was looking into a home biofeedback device to help teach me to control stress reactions. I looked at this system, and the ""Journey to the Wild Divine"" system. I just couldn't take the New Age spin that came with ""Journey."" I don't want a computer program to help me to imagine being one with the universe; I want a computer program that says, ""Your heartrate is too high. Lower it."" When I saw the reviews about how badly written the ""Journey"" software was, I went with Heartmath in the hope of finding a more professional product, despite its high cost.I was disappointed with what I got for the money. You get the USB finger sensor, and an installation disk for the software, and a quickstart guide. No further information is provided -- such as, what is heartrate variability? What is coherence? Why would you care? Is this the equivalent of ""clearing Thetans"" in Scientology, or is there some actual medical research behind this?Turns out there is some real science that shows a correlation between HRV levels and stress and anxiety. But correlation is not causation. I am not yet convinced that if I learn how to control my coherence, I will be able to retrain my body not to stress. I haven't had the time to go hunt up the science and read it carefully. If you are thinking of spending the money on this system, I would suggest you do that homework first.The software is . . . well, amateurish, to put it politely. It crashes and has other bugs, although it is usually simple enough to exit and restart the system. The graphics are incredibly crude, and the program does not manage multiple windows well.The only reason this package does not receive one star is because there isn't a whole lot of choice on the market for what this package does. And it does what it claims to do -- monitor and report HRV and coherence. Whether that is anything you should want or care about is a separate question."
422996,0,"I really like this protein shake, but had to give it only 3 stars because of my concern with soy and female hormones. I have read quite a few articles about how soy can mimic the female hormone estrogen in the body. That isn't necessarily a good thing for someone trying to lose weight (and could cause other issues also). I have problems with gluten and dairy products so thought I would try this. It mixes fairly well with just water and the taste is not that bad. I would continue to use if it wasn't for the hormonal concern."
300987,0,"It is pretty good for what it does. I wish the tip was no so pointy. I will definitely purchase other items like this, I think I need more than just the ""mini"" - but it is good for a first purchase."
315453,1,"I steam clean our carpets about twice a year, and have been looking for a truly non-toxic product for this purpose. After a [..] search, this company came up, and I found out their products were on sale at my local supermarket chain. I used this product in our Hoover steam vac, and the carpets came out just as clean (if not better) than Hoover's chemical laden cleaners, and actually smelling much nicer probably due to the chamomile, bergamot, and sage ingredients. It gives me peace of mind and satisfaction to know that my 'special needs' 4 year old can play in her room without the concern and worry that an unhealthy, toxic chemical cleaner brings about. I will be using this carpet shampoo on a regular basis now. Mega kudos to the 'Earth Friendly Products' company for offering this godsend of a carpet cleaner!"

167208,0,I bought these tights to give me some mild support during pregnancy. The material is sturdy and does not run despite constant pulling and tugging. This is because the stomach and crotch are too loose and require frequent readjustment. I would either order one side smaller or the thera firma brand which is just as sturdy and stays in place.
356381,2,"My husband of 6 years has been a recovering meth addict for the last 15 years and he always seems to relapse. I had left him 5 years ago because of his meth use and began filing for divorce, but then I discovered I was pregnant with our daughter. I gave him one last chance and I thought he had gotten and stayed clean. Since our daughter was born 4 years ago though he's sworn he hasn't used. Although there were some things that made me question how truthful he was about that, I always ended up believing him because the First Check Drug test always indicated he was clean. Well his behavior over the last 4 months has been so crazy that I was certain he had to be using, I would even watched him urinate into the cup to make sure he wasn't doing something to tamper with the results, but once again when I used First Check Drug test he came up clean. I started thinking he had some sort of mental illness and started seeking psychiatric help for him. Well a month and a half ago I retested him, and once again it indicated he was clean. Three weeks ago he was in an agitated crazy state, I'd never seen him like that and he had never ever hit me before that night, He ended up punching me several times in the face and head, that not only caused swelling and bruising all over, but also a lump on my forehead that I have been told by the doctor may or may not ever go away. When the police finally found him to arrest him, they noted that they thought he was high on some drug, and then they actually discovered that he was indeed in possesion of meth. He later admitted that he had relapsed over a year ago, and that when he thought I was going to drug test him, he would disappear for a few days to get it out of his system, and then come home to gladly take the First Check Drug test knowing that it would inaccurately show he was clean. I tested him a month and a half ago, four months ago, and 9 months ago alone. Over the past four years I've used First Check a total of six times. Who knows how long he's actually been using because it doesn't work. It gave me a false sense of security which caused me to put my child and myself in a dangerous situation."

381968,2,"After being cheap and buying a 4-cell charger (Powerex MH-C204W $35) from Maha which restricts you to NiMH and has to charge in pairs; I finally got over my buyer's remorse and purchased this one and it's been great. ($65)Don't bother with chargers that requires you to charge 2 at a time. What I've found is that nothing ever drains the batteries evenly (one would always seems to get used up first); so when you charge them as a pair, the more ""empty"" one seems to never fill up and the cycle repeats itself! The battery reader I have doesn't tell me too much details and besides, how am I suppose to know which cell is more empty than the other unless I have some specialized ultra-sensitive battery tester?This is more anecdotal than actual science but I swear after a few charges, even brand new batteries don't hold as well so I decided to go with chargers that analyze each slots independent of others.So go with chargers that has independent control for each of the slots; this way each one gets it's own full charge.For me I liked the slow-charge feature and what I ended up doing was leaving at least one cell in the charger always so that any future add-ons are charge with the slow cycle (max 2 hours it appears.) If you take all the cells out, next time around any new inserts means you'd have to push the slow-charge button to set it up properly. With 8 slots I find that's plenty to go around and two hours charge time isn't going to be inconvenient.This one does NiCD as well as NiMH. Going to retire my Powerex MH-C204W to the garage for cells that I don't care much as about (flashlights, aaa based MP3 players for example) and use this one for the digital cameras & Flip video cameras.Also I've tried (over the last 5 years) various $10-20 chargers from Energizer, Duracell, BigLot-House brands, etc...those are all ""junk"" so to speak for digital camera usage. They're fine if you want to charge batteries to use for flashlights or where things don't get worked as hard. If this had been around years ago, I'd save a lot of money and headaches from experimenting with different brands and having the dreaded ""battery depleted"" message even with batteries freshly removed from the cheap chargers just a few hours earlier (imagine the irritation from the wife when the shot of the day is missed because the stupid battery and the spares you brought along are comatose...)I must have wasted at least $50 in batteries thinking it was the batteries when it was most likely the ""dumb"" chargers to blame....Update 2012-01-18: This thing stopped working 5 months in. I am careful with the unit; wasn't dropped; stayed indoors only and unplugged whenever not in use. But after 5 months, each individual battery slots would just blink on the LCD screen; no charging; I was so livid that I will never buy something this expensive again; went back to the old trusty 4-cell MAHA charger. Was hoping to take advantage of individual battery control but maybe future generations will be more robust."

416853,0,"I've never used Aim toothpaste before. My teeth didn't feel as clean as with other toothpaste I've used. It didn't make my mouth feel fresh after use. Although, it went on to my toothbrush easily, I wouldn't recommend this to friends or family. I did like the packaging, but the toothpaste was just so-so."
302336,0,"I have now owned this mop for 9 months and the vacuum section has broken at the hinge. I only use this for picking up assorted crumbs as I mop, nothing heavy duty but after attempts at gluing it, it is a complete loss. I would not recommend this product, it is expensive for not even lasting one year. I will stick to my traditional electric broom and purchase a clorox mop for the mopping (if you read my review below, you will understand why I won't buy the swiffer!).I have a lot to say that hasn't been said. First, I bought this to replace my Bissell electric broom and my pledge mop and go (which I love but has been discontinued so I can't get any more cleaner for it). I used to have a swiffer but it broke before a year and when I called the company, basically they laughed at me and said that they didn't make it to last more than a year (after paying for all the cleaning cloths and cleaner, you would think the mop itself shouldn't also need replacing that quickly but apparently swiffer is deliberately not making a good quality product so you can give them more of your money). Needless to say, I won't give swiffer my business ever again. So, my dilemma of what sort of mop to purchase. I thought this would be a great solution and wasn't worried about leakage, as long as it worked. The first time I tried to vacuum my kitchen floor, I found the rubber part of the mop section stuck to the floor every time I tried to move it back and forth. Nothing in the directions about this so I decided to try to put a dry mop cloth on it. This helped but now I am wasting dry mop cloths just to vacuum. Tonight, I decided to try to mop with it. I pulled out one of their cloths they sent with it, again, no info in the directions but I assumed the reason they put a peel off thing on the cloth is so that you can vacuum prior to mopping thus replacing the dry mop cloth I used last time. It worked fairly well this time but the peel off part began peeling off before I finished which then got the cloth used for mopping somewhat dirty.1. So, first point, everyone talks about how you can use any cleaner in it which is true but you are pretty much stuck with their own cleaning cloths since you need to have this peel off strip in order to vacuum prior to mopping. If this gets discontined like my pledge mop, again, you are stuck or you will have to buy another brand of dry cloths and also some wet cloths to use in its place.2. The mop actually works well, the cleaner picked up all sorts of dirt on my floor and it is nice having the ability to vacuum up any dust balls or crumbs you might have missed. The cleaner smells faintly of watermelon and is nice and not overpowering. The floor does not get too wet when using this mop, it squirts just the right amount of cleaner so that you can use it sparingly.3. The cleaning cloth barely lasted for my whole kitchen, it began to move around while mopping and I had to tighten/readjust it a few times so it is not perfect for larger areas.I think I have come up with a possible alternative to their cleaning cloths and I think it just might work.4. Next time I use this, I am going to stick a maxi pad (feminine care product) on it with the peel off strip down to vacuum. Then, I will turn it over and stick the ""wings"" in the slots on the mop top and use this side to mop. They are super absorbant and should work well. Plus, I am sure I can buy these in larger quantity for a cheaper price than the ones made for the unit. I will not not have to deal with being able to find stores that carry the cloths made for the mop and I will not be dependent on them if they discontinue the product.And finally, I just brought my electric broom back out of the closet. Although the suction on the Dirt Devil is good, it is much harder to use over the bumps on my tile floor and on my throw rugs near my sink and near my back door (it doesn't work at all on the rugs as you can't push it back and forth). I will use the dirt devil for mopping and catching the crumbs I missed the first time. For this purpose, it is fine."
170224,0,"While I think the Sonicare Toothbrushes in general are an excellent product and this version is certainly no exception, the addition of toothpaste is pretty silly. This feature makes the toothbrush replacement heads more expensive and harder to find. The same can be said of the toothpaste. It probably saves one a couple of seconds and I suppose would end the arguments regarding squeezing from the middle of the tube and leaving the cap off, but really how lazy have we gotten? I bought this toothbrush model because it was on sale and thereby cheaper than the others but I no longer use the toothpaste feature."
42813,1,"We have used this product for years and are very happy with it. Unfortunately, in this order the wrong version of this was shipped (there is another, I think newer, formulation called Primal Defense Ultra). The Ultra formulation doesn't *seem* to work as well for us. As I was not home when this arrived and hubby didn't realize there is a difference, he opened and began using the product. When I returned home a couple weeks later it was obviously too late to return the product.I am placing an order for this product again. Hopefully, the correct one will ship, as I really do like this, the original, formulation."

This cologne is indeed appropriate for day time wear and will not stink your fellow coworkers out of the office. The scent itself isn't bad, but I was looking for something with a stronger sent of vanilla, and am disappointed that with a name such as Raw Vanilla, it failed to deliver."

273005,0,Neurovar has really had a positive effect on my clarity. I feel I have had trouble focusing since my menopause and this has really helped me to do so.

256093,0,"I had a scrape on my elbow that wasn't healing quite right - every time I moved my arm, the developing scab would crack and expose the wound. And it hurt every time! Regular bandages kept the area too moist, so I tried this stuff.It does sting a ton and it does have a strong smell like nail polish. But once it dries, it doesn't hurt and it's just like a real scab. I found I had a much greater range of painless movement, and the wound healed faster.Because of the stinging, I wouldn't use it if a bandaid would do. But for cuts in odd places where bandaids don't work well, it's pretty good. I might try a different brand of liquid bandage in the future, but I'll finish my bottle of this first."

15652,0,"We love pampers premiums. They NEVER leak on either of my twins (boy or girl). (if someone is having leakage issues, move up a size!)These were a great buy when they were $7.49--they came close to BJs Wholesale price without the hassle of having to go there (and since I have twins we use a LOT of diapers). But the Yo-Yo pricing scheme of amazon ($7.49 one week, then $10.49 the next) is ridiculous. For one thing, a near 50% increase for ANY product is a lot, but to have it going up and down and up and down is infuriating. Amazon needs to get serious about diapers and make them a good deal consistently, or they will see their sales plummet thru the floor."

With a clip you can attach it to a diaper bag, pants pocket, purse, just about anything that will let you slide something over. Which means you can take your timer with you anywhere! Each timer can have an alarm set for it, so once you notice about how often your baby eats, poops, and sleeps you can set the alarm so that you know just about when something is coming up. The nifty part of this is that the alarm can be a sound or silent, meaning the buttons flash when set to silent, or the device chirps.A great product for trying to keep track of the times you've done what when you know you can't always count on your math at 2:30am or even 4 pm as you've been up and down for three days. So that you get accurate stats on what your baby is doing!"

The one I received is straight, and doesn't really contour to the wrist unless you pull it pretty tight. Also the picture doesn't show the back, where the velcro fasteners are, or you would see that the strip that the tabs stick to is a little over an inch wide, while the velcro tabs that stick to it are more than two inches long--so if you have a small wrist you end up with an inch or more of the velcro tab ends sticking up. Add that to the sewn-on label that also sticks up, and you have, well, tabs sticking out all over. It's definitely not something you would wear in public. It needs a sleeve to cover it, or else maybe you can cut the tabs shorter. But, aside from that, with the aluminum stabilizer, it does give good support."

181220,0,This is the second Chattanooga I have purchased. The first one was an oversized one and for a knee it was too big. This one was a good size for a knee. My only issue is that it doesn't hold cold as long as I would like. After 30 minutes the cold is noticably diminished. While it is usually recommended short times on ice I needed longer. Unlike an ice bag you can not refill it. It has to go back in freezer for an hour. On this one the seam split after 3 weeks. After a difficult search I found the company on the Internet and they guickly replaced. Perhaps the seam split was just a one time thing. I never had a problem with the other one I have owned for about 6 months. It is more convienient than an ice bad for extended usage.

98879,0,"I purchased this hoping this could be a natural alternative to deal with anxiety. I do have to say I have felt a slight increase in mood/decrease in stress when I used more than the recommended dosage. However, if I were about to have a full blown panic attack - or even just a spike of intense anxiety - I am confident this would not do the job. For example, if you have a fear of flying, this probably wouldn't get you through the flight but it might be nice to take the week before when you're anticipating flying, depending on the severity of your anxiety.Furthermore, I'm not sure this would be enough to substitute for something like zoloft/prozac etc, as I was originally hoping it would progress to. All in all, I'm not disappointed I purchased this as it does do something, but it didn't do as much as I was hoping. If you suffer from significant anxiety, this may be something that could be added to your antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication you take daily and perhaps used when you have a small increase in anxiety where you wouldn't normally take a Xanax/Klonopin/Valium but wish you could do something for it. Otherwise, if you're looking for this to be a maricle cure, that was not my experience (although, obviously it was some other reader's). I would give it a shot - and for what it's worth, I'm not sure if Amazon will take returned packages once they've been opened but the Vitamin Shoppe will (just make sure it's within 30 days) so that's always a ""risk free"" route to try, even though you'll probably get a better deal on here."
139970,2,"I have this unit, and rather like it....however, I grossly overpaid for the features I'm actually able to use.I no longer have a Windows-based computer, and will never own another Windows based computer, nor run an emulator for a Windows based computer.The data connection was why I originally purchased this unit...and own nothing but Macs running OS X Lion.There is no way to download the data for Lion.Omron does not support Macs, and apparently never will, despite a growing base of installation.Hand in hand with this...they also won't support the iOS platform as a way to view data.They instead rely on their arcane Windows software that looks like it was written over 10 years ago, and is barely customizable to do what you want and display the way you want.Save the money and buy something without the data transfer features, unless you're sure you will be able to use it long-term.Me.....this BP monitor was a waste of money!!!!I'm dumping it and going to buy one of the new iOS BP monitors, using it directly with iPhone/iPad.That's the way of the future....not OMRON's direction!!!!"

350508,0,This product was much heavier when placed on the shoulders than I anticipated. Therefore I cannot use it. This is no fault of Amazon but I think approximate weight of product should be specified and would assist customers in choosing whether or not to buy. There are other products on the market which are much lighter and just as efficient.

I really had to keep going over the same crumbs and dust bunnies to get it to sweep it. I think that the bristles don't reach the floor enough to do the job. I was really disappointed in this product but for what it would cost to return it it wasn't worth it. I also might add that if you have a really thick carpet it might work better for you, I was looking primarily for a bare tile, floor item that would pick up crumbs etc. However a sweeper is a sweeper and it should to the same job that a broom would do. My Grandmother had one many years ago and it was like magic! This one is cheaply made also. Hope that this helps."
145940,0,"My husband bought the WombSong Prenatal Sound System as soon as we found out I was pregnant. Too Early! Now at 22wks, I still struggle to find my baby's heartbeat. I don't feel too bad about it though because my doctor does too sometimes. (She's a squirmy little one) I love playing her music and talking with her throughout the day. It makes me feel like I'm already incorporating her into our lives. Do be careful about the volume, my baby kicks it if it's too loud. I also love reading stories to her at night. Overall, I think it's better for sharing with baby than it is for hearing the heartbeat."

You can work up a slight lather while brushing, but nothing that makes you look like a rabid dog.My only recommendation is to try the mint or other flavors because the lime taste like the Sourpatch Kids lime candy."

I still have to take decongestant pill every night. On the bottle of oil, it claims that the product is regularly tested for freshness, potency and purity by an independent FDA-registered lab and has been determined to be fresh, fully potent and free of mercury, cadmium, PCB and 28 other contaminants. I am hoping Carlson would post most recent test results regularly in its website or other place. I will update the review, when I notice the improvement of immune system."

It has velcro near the top where you can affix the flap. When it is empty, it's a little floppy (obviously) but generally is out of the way when you have it hanging off the back two handles of the chair. An extra row of velcro further down the back would be handy when its empty or close to empty but it's managable.Thank you."

It helps with dryness but I didn't notice anything like an anti-aging or brightening effect."

Unfortunately, it smells and tastes like fish which is something I just cannot tolerate. I tried it several times and just could not drink it. I have a close friend who is Asian and she likes it, but she eats a lot of fish sauce so I guess her tastebuds are adapted to that taste. Not mine. I would also say that I am not a finicky eater (I do eat fish), and I do tolorate a lot of tastes for the sake of eating healthy, including eating things on the bitter side - but 'fishy' is hard for me to swallow! So, for now, I will have to try something else. Anyone know what hawthorn berry tea taste like?"

When I opened the third batch, the wrappers on the chews were slightly sticky. The chews themselves were different from my first two experiences in that they were waxy and opaque on the surface. The waxy/stickiness made them difficult to unwrap and I tend to just have to squeeze them out of the wrapper. I'm guessing they were stored/transported at too high a temperature and melted at some point but really have no idea. I'm hoping that my next order is not like this one. We'll see."

I had also planned to buy on of the more expensive self-cleaning Braun's later on. But I saw this and thought I would kill two birds with one stone. No such luck, the shaver part works great and am very happy with it (but would have rather had the self-cleaning model) The beard trimmer part does not work that well. Took several passes to trim my beard evenly, and if your going for that stubble look it does not trim close enough. Even my 6-year-old Norelco took only one pass. I will use this as my primary razor for a few months till I can afford to buy the more expensive self-cleaning model. Then use this as my travel razor as it is one unit to pack instead of 2.Save the money and buy a sole beard trimmer and a sole shaver. You will be much happier and feel less taken by marketing."

Sometimes, when I close the lid, the UV light source does not activate. However, if I smack the entire unit into the palm of my hand a couple of times, it usually turns on. Hopefully, it won't just crap out in the long run.Also, I wish that it was somehow open to a little more air circulation. While I like the idea of the UV light source as a disinfectant, I remain concerned about the toothbrush staying damp in the case and have often discovered little droplets of water that have formed inside the case."

114684,0,"I bought this as an entry into the electric razor category. I have always ever used a regular razor, and I have a very tough beard that grows in different directions. I've used this for a couple weeks and it works ok. What I end up doing is going back and forth with the electric and then quickly cleaning up all the stubble that it couldn't get with a regular razor. What it does seem to do is pull the hairs further up to the surface so that when I go over my face with the razor it gets smoother than if I just used the razor by itself. For those of you with tough beards, don't expect that this will replace your regular razor. It's good to clean up the 5 oclock shadow, and it's a good ""pre-shave"", however I still need to use the old fashioned straight blade to get a clean close shave."
399132,0,"I've got serious problems with my feet and have for almost a decade. My heels split, crack, bleed and it is extremely painful. I've used this product many times since getting the stick and it helps only a tiny, tiny bit. The key is to apply it to heels that have been soaked, rubbed, scrubbed, pumiced, etc. Apply the product and then cover in an aloe-infused sock. If you don't do these things to your feet in addition to using this item, it does nothing for it. I do think the product works but not for SERIOUS problem feet."

I also liked the voice can be either super loud or normal. As far as the date and the time go, there are only 2 buttons to press so there isn't anything confusing about it.The main issue I have is that it looks cheaply made and it loses time. I placed brand new batteries in it and 2 months later is had lost over 30 minutes of time. My grandfather didn't have a clue how to change the time, because the settings are on the bottom of the clock and difficult to see and figure out."
341173,0,"I bought this product assuming it would seal my cut with a waterproof bacteria proof layer. It easily lost integrity whenever it was wet while washing my hands, which reopened my cut and caused annoyance and constant reapplication. A standard ""Band-Aid"" Adhesive Strip type of bandage would have provided the same layer of water sensitive barrior, but I guess this was more durable when dry and less permeable to bacteria than an adhesive strip. I will use this in the future when water isn't an issue, but when I need to get wet I'll seal cuts with a different Cyanoacrylate glue. Perhaps I will try LiquiVet, Vetbond or Dermabond."

377,1,"of course the user will not likely remain quiet. haha. All kidding aside, this is a very durable, quiet, waterproof multitasking vibrator. It does everything but complain about cutting the lawn. One thing I feel sets this vibrator apart from some of the others is the rotating beads. Since they are attached to rotating rods they don't stop moving when they come into contact with you. In vibrators that have loose beads, when the beads become depressed by the vaginal walls they sometimes stop moving. They are no longer stimulating the vaginal opening. This is not the case with this vibrator. Enjoy and don't forget to keep extra batteries or better yet...rechargeables."

I needed shoulder surgery from a riding incident and started taking it and after some therapy and three months had full range of motion with no popping in the joint and bersa. Wonderful stuff. You have to take double amount for 6 weeks to get it loaded into your body and then you just take maintenance dose afterwards. Same with your animals."

The electrical contacts on the bottom part become corroded and no amount of scrapping seems to fix the problem. So far this has been a minor inconvenience since I have been able to return the faulty unit and get a new one free of charge. I hope they will keep exchanging the broken units free of charge."

The other day the shaver ran out of power and would not recharge. I called the Braun toll free customer service number and we concluded that the cord was probably the problem.

404948,1,"If I take this without eating before or after, I don't have any burps.If I eat within an hour or so of taking it, then I burp from normal food, which I never noticed before until my burps started tasting like strawberry (true story). But I can't taste the fish, my boyfriend says &#34;your burps smell great&#34; (AKA he hasn't noticed), and the strawberry flavor -- not unpleasant, just odd if you haven't been eating strawberries -- does not linger. I do keep them in the freezer, but I'm not sure whether it makes a difference or not.I can't speak to any life changing health effects yet, but believe that this is a low-cost, low-effort way to do something healthy and supplement my diet. I will say that my skin and minor but persistent adult acne have been better in the short while that I've been taking this -- about a month, although not super consistently -- and I noticed that pretty early on, so I am delighted.Haven't tried other brands, but picked this one based on the Amazon reviews after holding off for a long time due to burp fears, and am glad I pulled the trigger. I started with the (very inexpensive) 60 capsule bottle and will graduate to the big one when I need to reorder."

This bib (I guess the politically correct term is ""clothing protector"") is nice and long, covering me down to my knees (and I'm 6'1""). I got the blue terry bib, which is more macho. It washes very well, and you might want to wash it right away because mine had a particularly pungent ""vinyl"" smell (the smell disappeared after one washing and drying, though). It covers my shoulders as well, and I like the waterproof backing. A great purchase, and I'm going to buy a few more."

However I must admit that I agree with many other reviewers that the battery live is very very short. I keep recharging it as it is low after a few (sometimes two) uses. Hopefully the manufacturer can improve on the battery. Also an indicator would be very helpful.

114437,0,"This is my third electric shaver by Braun. The first was a single foil, very similar in design to this one, which I replaced only because the cost of a new one was just a little more than a new cutting block and foil.My second was a twin foil, which took some getting used too, but eventually proved itself an excellent razor. The on/off switch suffered a mechanical failure, and rather than take it apart I decided it was time for a new one anyway.I purchased the 1775 because it was incredibly inexpensive, and I thought that given my satisfaction with my first single foil shaver that this one would be just fine. The first thing I noticed when using it was how quickly the motor seemed to bog down, making a horrible buzzing noise that even my wife commented on. I tried moving it more slowly across my face, approaching from different angles, etc., but it was still unable to 'motor through' the tough spots like my previous model.I also noticed a feeling of razor burn that I've never felt with an electric and even some bleeding. Both could be a result of pushing down too hard and the thinner foil, as noted by another reviewer. I'll have to try shaving more gently.My three star rating is based on the fact that it now takes significantly longer to shave than before, since the shaver does not move as easily through the tough areas comfortably. I may need to take advantage of Braun's 30 day money back guarantee."
12880,0,"I really had a bad sinus infection and needed relief. This product looked appealing since I own their ""shoulder ice pack"" and love it. The sinus mask fits confortably and conforms to your face nicely. It is puncture proof and easily adjustable. My only complaint is that it only last about 15 minutes. I feel this is due to the fact that it is not as ""thick"" as say their back or shoulder products. It makes bedtime and after work so much more relaxing. If you need a cheap form of relief from either headaches or sinus troubles by all means pick one up."

93418,0,"Hands down, one of the best electric razors for professional use. Motor is crazy powerful, I think it scares some customers who have not experienced it yet lol! But from a professional standpoint, the power is awesome. I used a Braun electric razor before, and would always have to make multiple passes when shaving heads for razor fades or whole head shaves, trying to not leave any stubble. THIS RAZOR DOES IT IN ONE PASS! Customers love it once they experience how close it shaves without causing razor rash/burn or bumping.This is my major complaint...I started using this razor in May, moderate use. I don't shave heads everyday, all day long; maybe a couple a day, say ten to fifteen a week. Well, it stopped working as a cordless razor about a month ago. I can only use it when it plugged in to the outlet. The supplied power cord is very long and lightweight, so that is not exactly a problem for me at work, but if i had to travel or...i don't know what, but it should still work less than 6 months after purchase, and for this i give it only 3 stars.My only minor complaint is, I am already replacing the foil head assembly. But that might be normal with the amount of use it has seen.But bottom-line, this razor blows every other razor I've used out of the water with ease. You cannot beat the price or performance of this razor. Maybe my next one will be more durable, or maybe I'll give the Andis razor a go. I haven't heard anything good or bad about the Andis razor, but I'd only heard good things about the Wahl."

175701,0,"Don't be misled like I was on this shaver. The only titanium on it is a titanium coating on the pop-up trimmer -- there's no titanium on the shaver's foil cutters. The trimmer is supposed to work in combination with the cutters. Per the manual, ""Your new Remington shaver provides a close, comfortable shave on your entire face, even on the tough spots like your neck and chin. Simply engage the special Titanium-coated trimmer blades so they are aligned with the shaver foils."" Excuse me? If I wanted to shave my face with an electric trimmer, I'd use my haircutting trimmer. And shaving with a trimmer ain't exactly ""comfortable"". The shaver does a POOR job without using the trimmer in combination with the foil. Shaving with the foil alone leaves lots of long hairs that just wont enter the screen no matter how many passes I make, unlike _orelco products. Had I known this from the start I'd have just bought another _orelco.Further, the MS3-1700 IS NOT worldwide voltage, regarless of what amazon says. It is a single votage model (120 VAC, 60Hz), again per the manual. Finally, the cordless only feature mentioned elsewhere is a hassle. If you run out of juice on the battery halfway through a shave your out of luck since it will not run off of the cord.With all that said, by using the trimmer/foil combo technique suggested, this shaver does give a nice close shave, perhaps even closer than the _orelco. And if you don't like it, Remington has a supposed 30 day money back guarantee.Even with all it's drawbacks, I'm still satisfied with it and will probably keep it. The price sure is right."
223413,0,"Chose this product because i'm pretty self-conscious about my teeth. I smoke, drink soda, etc... So my teeth aren't ghastly, but they're noticebly yellowish. I don't actually have the product with me right now, but if you've already bought it and went through the contents - on the color scale my teeth were at like a 3 or so.So here's the review. The product itself comes with a cd and pamphlet with instructions but you don't need it, you can go on youtube and watch the tutorial. The one thing the tutorial doesn't show is how ridiculously hard it is to get the strips in place correctly after you've &#34;painted&#34; your teeth with the brush (at no time during use did I ever positively know if I had the strips on correctly). By the way, the applicator brush in the instructions doesn't match with what you actually get, and it took a while to figure out how to use it. It doesn't come with any generic lip balm, but it's plastered all through the instructions and on the video tutorial on how strongly it's advised to be used. It's a bit puzzling to figure out how to use the first time, but after that it's easy. The only other thing of concern is that I experienced extreme pain on the 2nd use. So much so, I thought maybe my spit came in contact with the apparatus and was shocking me, but it wasn't and I just dealt with the pain that session. I never experienced the pain after that.As far as results, it works. Not remarkably, but it works. I took a picture of my teeth pre and post use and couldn't really tell a difference. But, on one occasion at work somebody said my teeth looked whiter. I don't know if it's some kind of gimmick, but it's been about 2 weeks since I used it and I am pretty sure my teeth are back to the original color. Im thinking it's a paint on whitener thing that fades shortly after use.Does it work? Yes. Is it worth it? Not in my opinion."

393198,0,"I previously reviewed this tub as a 5 star, but that was when my son was still a newborn. I love the hammock since it holds the baby in very nicely and provides good support so you can bath him easily. And the plug which changes color if the water is too hot is a nice feature also. So, those parts still deserve the full credit.Well, now that my son is 5 months, the sling isn't working out so good since he's outgrown it of course. So that leaves using one of two sides of the tub that form a sort of seat. One side is slanted and the other has the baby sitting straight up. My problem is that the curved part near the baby's buns on either side which forms the seat part, hurts my sons back because his lower half floats up a bit and his back ends up resting on the edge. It even has left a mark, so everytime i bath him, i have to lay a towel in it first, which makes clean up pretty annoying after awhile. So if I could choose a tub again, I'd get something that didn't have the preformed seat. I know when they designed this they probably meant for it to help hold the child in place, but so far it's not working."

178037,1,"So 6 months has passed & I'm still using this thing! In fact, I can't live without it. I used it at first to time my contractions, took it to the hospital to time everything else. The thing that I love most about this Itzbeen timer is that I was able to figure out my daughter's schedule very early on & tweak it a little to suit both of us. Not all babies eat every 3-4 hours & nap for hours at a time so this really comes in handy in figuring out what works best for your baby. In 6 months, I've only had to change the battery once & now my daughter enjoys the lights on it & uses it as a toy sometimes. It also has a lock so you don't have to worry about accidentally pushing buttons.I HIGHLY recommend this for every new parent or anyone wanting to get a new parent a very handy gift.

363365,0,"This product has done much to alleviate problems in menopausal and perimenopausal women over the years. However, it did me quite a bit of damage. I first started taking it for uterine fibroids, and it did help with that problem. However, this product is fat soluble, and builds up in the body over time. In my case, I am extremely sensitive to cortisol, which is a steroid manufactured by the presence of progesterone. The build-up of this steroid in my blood caused gastroparesis (paralysis of the large muscle in the stomach), insulin resistance, hypothyroidism, and vitiligo, which is a whitening of the skin in patches. A saliva test confirmed the build-up of progesterone in my system, and I stopped using the cream. As a result, everything is back to normal except my thyroid which will probably always require supplementation. To avoid a repeat of my cautionary tale, make sure you test yourself at three month intervals with a saliva test for hormone levels that you can do at home, mail off to a lab, and have the results sent back to you, without the need for an expensive office visit. Careful monitoring will give you the maximum benefit without the possible horrific side effects.As an aside, under ""Product Features"" there is a Bible verse quoted. I am somewhat offended by a Bible verse being used to advertise such a product."

14776,2,"You need magnesium to be able to absorb any form of calcium. This powder takes care of that issue. However, if high doses of magnesium give you diarrhea like they do me, it is possible that this product by itself would not be right for you.Calcium citrate is supposed to be more easily absorbed by the body than the calcium carbonate found in the majority of over the counter calcium supplements. What is so nice about the pure powder is that it is ""one less pill"" (or 3 or 4 less) to swallow. It mixes easily into juice, tea, soup, cereal and other wet/moist foods and drinks. It does NOT mix easily into a thick milkshake type smoothie. It turns clear liquids cloudy and settles out if you let it sit for some time.The trick is to remember to measure it out and mix it in!!!Keep in mind that you won't absorb any form of calcium if you don't have the proper combination of magnesium, zinc, Vitamins A and D3. The ideal thing is to get all of your nutritional needs from whole food, not from supplements. Sometimes this is not possible for various reasons, and it is good to know what is in everything you ""take"" including the foods you eat.It is a good idea to get professional assistance in the form of testing to find out what supplements you really need. And, if you are taking one supplement you need to do a bit of research to make sure you are getting the proper balance of other things that are needed for your body to use that supplement so you are not throwing your money out the window.I believe this calcium magnesium citrate is sourced from corn, although I have not contacted the NOW company to specifically ask that question. In any case, it gives me diarrhea - as does anything else made from corn. It doesn't bother my husband. You need to know your own body and what you can and can't tolerate.As one other reviewer pointed out: This product is NOT GMO free. I ordered it because I wanted a calcium magnesium blend powder that I could use instead of taking 4 to 6 more pills a day and wasn't thinking about what it was made from. My mistake. I will not be reordering this product. Somehow and somewhere I will find a healthy form of calcium that is certified non-GMO."

280787,0,"I'm like a lot of you, I've been shaving with a blade since day one but thought I'd try an electric shaver to touch up as needed, who knows, maybe even a replacement for my Mach 3 blades.I'd call my beard fairly heavy but it seems a lot of you have it worse. I've always shaved AFTER showering when my beard is ready. I've seen buddies just grab their shaving creme, lather up and start sawing away. Dude, why not after your shower? I've got friends who shave IN the shower (they've told me this, I have no first hand knowledge!). If I don't shave every day and a half I look like a barbarian, a full beard in two weeks.So, after much studying these types of forums I got me a Panasonic ES8043. I don't know what the ""SC"" means in the description of this shaver on this thread because mine isn't designated as such. Funny, they say, ""give it a 30 day tryout so your face can get used to it."" And their return policy is within the first 30 days! Go figure. Anyhoo...I've had this for about two weeks. And as others have said about any electric shaver, there's no way in heck it can give me a shave as close as my Mach 3, just no way. Those who have always used an electric and claim this I can only guess just don't know what a blade-close shave can be. But...It does do what I bought it for, that is--to tone down my barbarianness as needed. But after three or four shaves I notice the hairs it invariably misses are still growing wildly (mostly on my neck) and look to be seeking an ingrown kind of experience. So...three electric, one blade (and, yes, the blade shave is as close as a blade). I've found that if I wet my face maybe 5 minutes before I launch the Panasonic it really helps, because just electric on bone-dry doesn't work nearly as well. And I'm never going to lather up before hand because that's specifically what I'm trying to avoid, more as a time saver than anything else.Who knows, maybe I won't grow my winter beard this season if this combination of shaving techniques keeps the cutting of my face to a minimum. It'll be cold without the beard, but change is good, right?I gave it three stars because the final product was just as I'd expected. If it was truly a replacement for my Mach 3 blades I'd give it 5 stars."
407121,0,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way.

It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining.""Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity.

Our oncologist has indicated that while foods containing soy are ok in reasonable amounts, SOY ISOLATES ARE NOT SAFE FOR THESE TYPES OF CANCERS.Research backs this up.These bars are possibly cancer-promoting in the sense that they have estrogenic-effects.Women who are at risk for breast cancer (and who knows how much of the population this includes -- we don't know until after we have gotten it most of the time) SHOULD NOT BE EATING THESE BARS.Maybe they can put a warning label on them to say women should check with their doctors before consuming them.The research on this is readily available on the Internet, and my oncologist has studied this issue extensively.We are sad to give these bars up because they were our favorite in terms of flavor."

355052,1,"I'm not sure how it all started, but I got on this kick questioning marketing ploys and schemes for all the products I use. One day, my razor was in question. I did a lot of research and decided to give a double edge razor a try. After all, who can argue with the cost savings? For me, my razors where getting really expensive. I'm a triathlete. And, I do shave most all body hair. Especially the legs! What an expensive habit! And, the shave was never really that close. It didn't last all that long, either.I bought the 1904 razor first. What an aggressive shave! But, boy was it close! I've never felt such a smooth shave. There was a little bit of a learning curve. I cut myself a few times. But, no big deal. I got the hang of it quickly.I needed another razor for my locker at work. I then decided to give a longer handle a try (the shorter one can be a bit slippery for me) so I bought the Model 180. What an awesome razor! It shaves so beautifully! (Must be the closer tolerances.) It's not as aggressive and I get cut less. No razor burn, no partial shave, and a good soap makes the feel so nice. I loved it so much, I bought another one for home.I can't believe I've been so duped my whole life into disposable razors having something like two, three, four, or five blades, rotating heads, gel layer this and that, or whatever (isn't there one with a battery now that vibrates?). There can't be any data all those blades shave better because one use of my double edge and I know instantly it puts every disposable razor to shame.For me, this experience was well worth the try."

35297,2,"I bought this item and tried it at home around my eyebrow area. How it works is you're supposed to touch this salty water with one hand and then use the machine on yourself. Stick the machine's needle into the pore from which the hair grows and wait (tearing up from the slight stinging pain) while a little white bubbly mess starts forming around the pore. Then you're theoretically supposed to pull out the hair easily.Ok, and the reality is that I don't recommend people to buy and use this product. Let a professional do it if you must, TRUST ME. It is very hard to get the little needle to go properly into the pore... you end up damaging skin on the surface of your skin and under it as well. Also, the needle gets bent pretty easily. My eyebrow area ended up looking pretty mangled up after my attempt-- there were small red craters in various places between and around my eyebrows.Oh, and the hairs grew back anyway because the settlings don't go high enough.The needle is too weak to work on the really dark hairs, like those on my underarms. I killed a needle that way and I still couldn't not get the hair out easily. I also tried it on a few light hairs on my forearm too, which was easier to work with since I have a clear view of my arm, but I honestly don't think that made a difference either long term. Oh, and short term I left some small scars on my arm as well.This machine is not very expensive, so I thought I would give it a try, but honestly just save your money and save your cabinet space as well."

Much easier than using an actual teaspoon or tablespoon to measure, and much more sanitary than constantly re-using the measuring cup that comes with the bottle. Note that they have a line for &#34;1 DSSP.&#34; (dessert spoon) instead of &#34;2 TSP.&#34; - they're exactly the same volume, but for whatever reason, they use the uncommon term (I've never seen cough syrup call for &#34;1 dessert spoon&#34; in the dosage).The cups have markings for 1/2 TSP (teaspoon), 1 TSP, 1 DSSP (dessert spoon; equal to 2 TSP), 1 TBS (tablespoon; equal to 3 TSP), and 2 TBS on one side, as well as milliliters and cubic centimeters (2.5 - 30), fluid ounces (1/8 - 1), and drams (1 - 8)."

245308,2,"When I lost my Norelco 6885XL (which is Norelco's equivalent top-of-the-line razor), I bought this. I shouldn't have. The shave that I get from the Braun is much less smooth than from the Norelco (although a regular safety razor like a Mach 3 beats them both by a decent margin, regardless of what the ads say). This one has a fancy electronic cleaning system that requires buying a cleaning cartridge every month or so. It still doesn't seem to be any cleaner than the Norelco, which just needs to be washed. I find myself having to shave the same areas of my face over and over and over to get a semi-reasonable shave. Trust me, just buy the 6885XL instead, and you most likely won't be disappointed. It's a much better razor."

I don't think I will keep dishing the money to buy these when I can pay a fraction of the price for a a product that for ME has pretty much the same affect. It's only good for one period cycle and I cannot fathom spending that kind of money every month when I can spend a fraction of that on a much cheaper brand that virtually has the same results. I am glad it helps for many people, but for me, I'll stick to my regular brand."

But the trimmer is much to be desired, the head for the shaver blades gets in the way of the trimmer head because the trimmer does not come out far enough so you have a hard time maneuvering the trimmer around and seeing what you are doing.I purchased the shaver from Amazon.com and I thought the price was good compared to other providers.Thank you,Fred"

237252,0,"Great idea in principal, avoiding messy to clean, space eating potty chairs.Plastic material is more lightweight and flexible than I would like and it does not quite fit flush on our Mansfield elongated toilet, causing it to flex and trap small (and big!) fingers when you sit down on it. Also one handed operation is not possible since the two seat layers tend to stick together at the hinge point and lift or drop together like the pages of a cheap book. Difficult for the ""child on the other arm maneuver"" or the easily startled toddler who gets a ""seat in the face"" when lifting the lid.My 20 month olds find the step up a little tall and a little narrow for confident self positioning, and the boy bits bump at the front is too bulky for my little girls to get over comfortably. I think the whole set up will work better for a more in dependant older toilet user who just does not want to fall in to an adult sized toilet."

After a while, it was okay and not overpowering.No directions...justtouch the controls BEFORE you get started, that way you will know what to do during the ""act"".All in all, it served the purpose, relatively quick.I wouldn't say it was WOW, but I will say that it accomplished the goal.

153254,0,"Feb 24 2012 update- sent a note directly to the manufacturer. They sent me a new to of cream. Far better than the most recent batch, but not as good as the original. Still great, just not as much. The ingredients listed have changed and there is a mention of the removal of some ingredient that some group believes is probably radioactive, mutant producing, and some other things. Bottom line is that the cream is no longer as firm or long lasting. Still good stuff, will buy more, but it is a shame when great products slip a notch.Dec 2011-This is an update to my prior review. I eagerly opened my yearly Christmas gift of this shaving cream, only to find that the formula has changed. No longer does it have the great smell, and the firmness of the cream has been reduced to something like frosting. Have written complaints to the manufacturer, but in the meantime, I have become disappointed in this product. I am saddened by the downhill slide of this once great product. Earlier review is below.If you are going ""old school"" with your shaving, this is the way to do it. First, my wife loves the smell it leaves on me, and I have to agree. I am not one for colognes, and this has a great, masculine smell (do not agree with the claims of it being too ""perfumey"" as some review have stated).As I have a beard, I do not shave every day, only a few times weekly, and this small tub of cream lasted from one Christmas to the next. You do not need to go so far as a the straight edge, or single edge razor as I have, as this works well with any razor type I have found. What you do want to do, however, is to get a good badger hair shaving brush and drying stand for it. The brush is an absolute must. Got my second bowl of this cream this Christmas, and will continue with it."
419704,0,"These are among the best blades I've seen...on the first use. When new, they give a very nice clean, smooth, and even shave on your face.After that, it's a MAJOR pain to clean out the whiskers that get caught between the triple blades. I had to spend 10 minutes shaking the razor in both standing and running water to clean it out. Now when you're up in the morning trying to get ready for work, you don't have that kind of time to spare cleaning a razor.Problem is, if you don't clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.Also, even after cleaning, it doesn't last very long at all. On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &quot;indicator strip&quot; sooner.I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem."

I'm back to my old hunger levels and snacking habits, and I'm cold again. I don't know why, but it seems as though my body gradually became accustomed to the capsules and reacted accordingly. :( Definitely not for long-term consumption."

When you shaver breaks under the warranty period, you must ship it off to a service center (good luck finding one in your area) and wait 4-8 weeks for it to fixed and returned. This shaver cost almost 300 hundred dollars and Braun should be ashamed to have put their name on such a cheap product."

Every single finger turned inside out as I struggled to get them off my medium sized hands, and this was when the gloves were still DRY and right out of the box. Doing so after washing the dishes is going to be a pain."

231263,0,"I've always loved oolong tea, but live in an area where it's black tea, or green tea if you're lucky and that's it. I saw the oolong on Amazon and the price on this particular brand was excellent. I ordered 10 boxes. The company shipped very quickly. The tea itself is good IF you don't let it brew too long. Don't let it turn a rich shade of brown or it will be too bitter. After several tries, I finally found just the right amount of time and water and am pleased w/the taste. It might take a little experimentation, but don't give up after the first cup if you don't like it. Try again and it should work out. Supposedly oolong is good for the complexion, digestion and weight control..........we'll see about that. In any case, when brewed properly, the taste is fine and the cost is very good especially compared to the other brands listed."

37065,0,I thought this was going to make flossing easier and faster but that's not the case. The flossing isn't as useful with the lack of power from the device. The picks are not that great either and you will end up spending a lot of money buying refills. At least it comes with a AAA battery.All I can say is just stick to the simple flossing because you will end up spending a lot of money in the long run while not getting that much better of a clean.

252182,0,"When I wrote the original review for this product prior to this edit, I gave it a satisfactory review, however now that its almost two years later and I have had experience with other similar anal kits I can without a doubt say that there are much better products available. I will get into more detail why, but in short I would recommend the Trinity Vibes Silicone Butt Plug Kit available through amazon as a great kit for beginners. That particular kit uses much higher quality materials and the design of the plugs is better suited to beginners. As far as this kit goes, the quality of the plugs themselves are a bit sub-par. Each plug consists of a white plastic core wrapped in pink rubber. The main issue with this is that the pink plastic cover doesn't completely encase the core meaning that water and germs could in theory slip between the two layers. Cleanliness is always a major concern when using toys, and this design flaw is a cleanliness concern. As far as the design of the product in regards to shape, length, girth etc, there are many flaws to mention. Starting with the smallest plug, there is no hourglass shape enabling the plug to stay inside on its own, therefore causing it to slip out frequently. The problem with medium size plug is that it really isn't that different in size from the small, which is an issue if you're looking to gradually work your way up. The large one is simply gigantic relative to the medium to the point where its just too dramatic of a change. The problem with all of them, and especially the large one is that they are too long. The excessive length makes it feel as though the plug is poking you from the inside in a very uncomfortable way. Finally the vibrator that's included is much to large for anal use based on girth but mainly based on the length. This vibrator is better used for vaginal stimulation then anything else. Ultimately look at another kit."

It's comfortable, but tends to lead depending on the angle I'm sitting or laying.These are great if you're going to be staying home or know the places you'll be going have a sink right next to the toilet.

76734,0,"i bought this expecting a miracle but really it is just a slightly higher-decibel derivative of a small 10"" oscillating table fan that you could buy for $20 at wal-mart. i know, i have one. i'm sure you could buy a 12"" or slightly bigger fan and get an even louder noise out of it.the bottom line is that it isn't loud enough, although it's small and fits in simple places and makes noise that isn't overwhelmingly adjustable for such a steep price. i live in an apartment that i am convinced is either built poorly (shouldn't be for the price i pay) or i have overweight neighbors that walk VERY LOUDLY in the mornings when they wake up 2 hours ahead of me. this wakes me up every morning. i know i am a light sleeper, but i've lived in a dozen apartments in the last 10 years and only one other time had problems like this, and have lived in much cheaper apartments. also, not until now did i break down and purchase one of these because of my dire situation. so it is safe to say the level of noise that comes from the apartment above me is not something even this little machine on crack would be able to cover up.with that said, this product didn't solve my problem and i still wake up every morning when the neighbors get up. but even if it had solved my problem, my $20 table fan would have as well (and i wouldn't have had to buy this unit). ""this item is for apartment dwellers"" is in the description of the item, but i will refute that statement 100 times over if you have upstairs neighbors with weight issues OR thin walls.marpac should really make an extreme version for people that have extenuating circumstances like mine and put a 747 jet engine in it. 3 out of 5 - too much money and not as loud as you are expecting it to be. compare with a small table fan later for proof."

I have no doubt that it increases energy expendature, but also makes me sweat and makes my hands shake.This product can and does work, but try it before you buy. Also while this product is listed by weight, its actually 100 capsuls with a recomended dosage of 1 per day for day one, then 2 for days 2 and 3, then 2x 2 from then on. I cannot imagine 4 pills a day. But like anything else, I imagine this product has diminishing returns so i could see needing 4 maybe a couple months from now."

He spitted it out after about 3 seconds of sucking. I trust the brand since my family has consumed this brand for over a decade. Too bad, this one didn't work for my children."

188716,0,"I loved the flavor so much but if you are prone to ulcers in your mouth or canker sores - please avoid this one. In all the sensitive area on the underside of my tongue, the worst canker sores developed. Apparently some people are allergic to the sodium lauryl ___ in the toothpaste (which as I understand it, holds the flavor) - that combined with the cinnamon and clove flavors - erupted into the worst mouth ulcers. Please be careful I would hate for anyone to go through what I went through. I am fine with other Tom's of Maine flavors."

56477,0,"I usually love whatever I buy from Amazon. However, I have to say that these Balance bars were a disappointment. Our family loves Balance bars and we thought these tasted pretty good--however, after running out and buying some at the local Safeway, we realized that the locally bought bars taste quite a bit better because they are FRESH. Turns out the chewy taste we were used to from the bars we purchased here are in fact, stale. They still taste decent, but from now on, we will watch for sales and not buy these online."
48601,0,"The imse vimse liners are fine, they are a bit rough but it does not seem to bother my daughter, though she is admittedly thick-skinned. The upside is that you can wash the ones that have just been peed on at least once right along with the diapers and reuse them, plus they are much softer after the wash. However, I ordered these liners and they did not send me 200 of the baby sized liners as described, instead they sent me 100 of the toddler size which are far, far too big for my purposes and, alas, not quite big enough to simply cut in half so I ended up trimming off and wasting about 1/3 of the liner. Annoying. Amazon was moderately helpful and the dispute was resolved to my liking after I bullied them into simply refunding me half of my money since they sent me only half of the liners that I ordered."
408563,0,"I have over the years used several Braun shavers, panasonic, norelco, and remington. I think the accolades for this shaver must depend on what you expect. This produces an average shave, nothing more. If you look at the reviews for the model without the LCD, there are additional complaints in this area.I had to replace the cutter and foil after only 8 months. Do not expect to get 18 months as indicated by the manufacturer, it will not happen.The previous Synchro shaver I bought had the cleaner base break in a month.This model is definately far superior in that regard. I have had no problems.However, the shave itself is average. The new design is no improvement at all, and neck hairs are near impossible to shave.I think the Panasonic high speed shaver is superior to this, at about half the price.This product is way too expensive for its ability, and you keep paying and paying to use it."
106764,0,"The product is fine, but doesn't get as close as I would like, but that may just be typical of electric shavers."

397751,0,"I really can't fully endorse this product. It works well enough as a beard clipper although it is pretty big for its intended purpose; almost as large as a full size barber shear. I thought my wife would appreciate the mess reduction but the anemic vacuum collects only about half of the beard clippings. The course nature of beards really makes this impossible without a shear that connects to your shop vac. It is kind of flimsey too. I haven't dropped mine but I doubt is would survive a single blow to the cutting head. My advice....look for the smallest, cheapest beard trimmer and use it in the bath tub or outdoors."
386538,0,"I am a female so I didn't take them for my (nonexistent) prostate. I took them to help with my hormones for my skin and hair loss and I didn't notice any difference from them, but they weren't terribly expensive, nor were there any ill side effects. I don't think this will help many people, considering the majority of humans who purchase these will be males."
130972,0,"I bought this after trying out the larger version in the store. I thought this would be better b/c it's small and portable, which was true, but I think the other one gives a better overall massage. BUT, for the money, this one is pretty darn good and definitely worth a try. The massage mechanism is very strong and gives your back a good workout. I think it could be improved by offering a heat option, car adaptor and a ""width"" option as it was a little tough on my spine in some areas. Some massagers just vibrate, but if anything, you will need to put a towel on this one as the shiatsu it is VERY strong. Pretty impressive for the price--the next one up is AWESOME."
105707,0,"Today is day 5 of taking this multivitamin. I happened to stumble across it in my pantry and thought, ""why not""? I've been on a new health kick (eating much healthier and working out daily) so I'm hoping this will give me an extra boost. I eat a granola bar for breakfast because I don't have much time in the morning to make a gourmet meal. I take this right before I leave for work and about 5 minutes later I'm hit with a terrible weird nausea feeling. I do feel like I may up-chuck, but I'm able to hold it down. It only lasts for about 1 minute, and then I'm fine the rest of the day. Considering it's only been 5 days, I can't comment on any results. But if you have a weak stomach, I don't suggest taking this. This vitamin must obviously work over time, because if it didn't, it would have been pulled from the shelves a long time ago. I'm going to try and tough it out!"

63816,0,"This is an inexpensive blood pressure monitor and I like the idea of the manual pump, but it does not always work and than you have to re-pump which is a waste of time and energy.

309528,0,"I purchased this razor 6 months ago because of the concensus by so many with tough beards and various dysfunctions, that this was the holy grail - well, I'm here to tell you, it is not - I have a $30 Norelco from Walgreens that does just as well - the hair on my neck grows in different directions near my adam's apple, this razor doesn't do a thing to them, even when I move around at different angles - so, if you've got ingrown hair problems or hair that isn't straight North/South, this razor isn't going to do anything for you that a razor costing $100 less won't - it's great for an easy shave, and nothing more, definitely not worth the money."

I do think it has helped my wrist pain a little, though. So, if you don't mind looking like you haven't washed your wrist, the bracelet itself is quite nice. Make sure you don't get it too big, though, because it'll move around too much and pinch your skin. I have small wrists and the small was perfect for me."

331694,0,"I took with a huge success, a fat blocker about ten years ago, by the generic name of Chitosan: shrimp shells etc.It worked almost exactly like this Alli. It bound to fat, making fat pass through the system, with diorehea symptoms, and ALSO required you to take a multi-vitamin becuase it would strip away some vitamins.The FDA site, then, can't seem to find the articles today, stated Chitisan was effective with exercise, and multivitamines, and correct, low-fat, dieting.I lost about 40#'s.NOW: this Alli sound very very similar in all its effects, how it works and side effects. So, my question is: does anyone here can offer some insight to this phenom?I mean, Chitosan which can still be purchased on-line is much less expensive and just as effective if done exactly as Alli. I want to try Alli to experience it's effects, but at the cost being shown, this seems to be more costly than effective Chitisan.BTW, you MUST exercise and diet correctly. This is not a cure all, only an aid, but I lost that 40+#s in about six months...I was obsessed, but perhaps did it too quickly...oh, they young and foolish. Now that I'm in my mid 50's, I am satisfied to diet, exercise and work more slowly at it. PS: after about six years, I regained about 10-15# back, but am re-loosing that again."

136483,0,"Most diaper caddies out there for your changing table take up valuable table space, so this really appealed to me since it ""hangs"" over the edge of the table. Mine came cracked, and I didn't have the patience to send it back and get another one, as my baby was due soon and I wanted one less thing to worry about. It looks nice and works well, gets the job done. The only thing I worry about is putting a full box of wipes in it, as I'm afraid it will completely break since it's already cracked. I don't know how it got cracked as the box it came in was in fine condition. Room for diapers, wipes, diaper cream, lotion & more. Would definitely recommend to all parents of newborns."

45666,0,"I purchased the Braun with some trepidation regarding purchasing a factory reconditioned personal care product. In fact, it looks to be in like-new good condition, with what seems to be a new foil head. I am fully confident in using it.I had been using a Norelco rotary and was curious which was better. I shaved one half of my beard with the Norelco for 90 seconds and one half with the Braun. Both seemed to do a very credible job, perhaps with a minor edge to the Braun. However, the Norelco, not being rechargeable and not having a battery, is light weight, and better for travel. Another advantage is that the sound is lower pitched. The Braun produces a loud whining noise that I find irritating, though I think this is typical of foil razors.On a Friday sale, expect to find the Braun about twenty-five percent lower than its current price. It is clearly a good value in that you will pay considerably more for a new one."
379888,0,Not too bad of a product. It works better in the winter and stays longer. The only disadvantage is that you have to wait 2 hours for it to get cold enough to use
310869,0,"They work obviously and are less expensive, but I find that the pregnancy line never darkens a lot. Even when other tests would show a dark line indicating pregnancy these pregnancy lines always stayed on the lighter side - even when they would show up before the control line. It's probably a silly complaint, but I found it annoying."
204251,0,"We've bought a number of these over the last few years. As other reviewers have mentioned, the machines tend to flake out after a few months. For us, it's always been the volume knob. The sound cuts out, then you jiggle the knob and it comes back on.Pros:- Runs on AC or battery - great for car trips with little ones- Pretty loudCons:- Default sound is jungle or something other than white noise, so if you lose power, when it comes back on you'll be surrounded by chattering monkeys.- Volume knob is flaky- Power cord can be flaky - if you have batteries installed, you'll be draining your batteries without knowing itSuggestions:- The fewer times you touch the volume knob, the longer it will last. Plug it into a power strip, and turn the power strip on and off.We've tried other devices, but this one seems to suck the least."
223453,0,"I am 49, a former RN, and have had Hashimoto's-type hypothyroidism for 15 years. Like many others, I am looking for something that might return my energy levels and my life more towards normal. The man-made synthetics just don't work for me. I tried Thyromine for about 6 weeks and have found that I am not particularly happy with it. The addition of adrenal powder (these glands produce your adrenaline hormones as well as regulate your water/electrolyte balance) served only to give me a morning ""high"" and then I would come crashing down at about 3 or 4 pm. They also have Nori in the combination, which is an excellent seaweed source for minerals and protein, used here for its iodine content. Few understand that iodine helps some thyroid patients, but can greatly exacerbate the condition in others, causing sore throat, difficulty swallowing and, eventually goiter. These tablets also contain Guglipid, L-tyrosine, ginger and Piper-Longum.I did not lose weight. There was no change in my ""dead"" libido. (These are two areas of concern for most hypothyroid sufferers.)There was one reviewer that reported that the 1mg of thyroid per capsule wasn't enough. I would like to say that 1mg is the standard dose for thyroid replacement. You can go up or down from there, depending on symptoms and labwork.In summary, I believe that the product is what it says it is on its ingredient list. I am very sad that they included the adrenal powder and other items. If you do not have adrenal insufficiency, take caution when using this, or any supplement, that has numerous glandular additions. You can get more than you bargained for and end up ""confusing"" other glands that have very important balancing jobs to do in the body. Be well-informed if you take any multi-glandular!For your information, I am currently trying Ultra-Enterprises Raw Thyroid. It is bovine-source thyroid, raw, freeze-dried and made into a tablet. It seems to be less potent, and it does have ""fillers"" but I feel much better, taking one in the morning, and one at night. So far, it is the best that I've come across for the thyroid ""searcher."""
410140,0,"I purchased these vitamin pills because they were the best value to be had here on Amazon. While there is no guarantee as to what they actually contain, the information on the outside of the bottle claims that they are jam-packed with vitams & minerals.They only problem is getting them down. You see, thay are BIG. And I actually took the time to measure them.Size: 7/8 x 3/8 Seven eights of an inch is just about an inch! At first I was having problems because I was drinking water with the pill in my mouth and waiting too-long to gulp it down. That is not a good thing to do because the longer you keep in in your mouth the more the coating dissolves and then the pill becomes bone-dry.But I have resolved to finish all 180 tablets. The best thing to do is... Wait until your thirsty, pop it in your mouth, then drink water and gulp it down fast withhout concentrating too much on the pill.And, if you can, try to align the tablet with your tongue so that it points straight down and not sideways.Good luck !"
162870,0,"If it works or not. Not sure what to look for or if it is even worth the while, but I thought it would be a decent replacement for fulvic minerals.

338671,0,This sponge has the potential to be awesome. My only issue with it is that I cleaned a knife with it when I first got it and the knife blade tore the sponge slightly. I do wish the material were tougher. I have taken great care ever since while washing my knives yet the sponge has now almost completely fallen apart all stemming from that one little tear. I will probably order another soon (because other than the slight delicacy of it it is great) but I am disappointed it didn't last as long as I hoped it would.The best thing about this sponge is that it does not get that disgusting old food smell that regular sponges seem to develop over time. It cleans very well.

336046,0,"I have to admit when I first received my canister of this product I was a bit put off by all the muscle building mumbo-jumbo on the label. While I am sure I would love a ""superior synergistic blend"" of ""effective compounds"" so that I can have ""mind blowing, skin bursting effects"", I would really just like to cut through the marketing and know what it is I am getting.So what are we actually getting in this big funky jar of powder?Some ProteinTheir own designer Creatine BlendCustom ""Fat-Burning"" MatrixAnd their own ""Power, Speed, Strength And Endurance Matrix""Yeah, I like how you can describe your desired effect and just call it a ""Matrix"". Either way other reviewers have gone very much in depth on the ingredients, and if you know enough to make sense of it all I encourage you to check them out. I intend to give my overall experience using the product.When mixed as per directions the solution was more watery then I typically like, so I tended to like cutting down on the water I mixed with. And then just make sure I drank and extra glass full after finishing.The flavor to be honest was off putting. Grape Bubblegum? Really? The mix is artificially flavored which I understand, but it just has a very odd weird grapey flavor, and kind of icky sweet. Not a big deal I suppose, no real bad aftertaste either for me, but I was not a fan and I would like something more traditional flavor wise.The real question is results, which I failed to see anything out of the normal for me. I followed the directions as indicated (Using a little less water at initial mix, drinking more water later) and I saw no significant increase to my lean muscle mass then what I was already receiving with my current diet and workout regimen.I am not an avid body builder but more or less just workout to stay in shape and stay healthy and this product did not yield any noticeable returns for me. I do realize however that I am a lone individual and your results may vary, but I found this product to be more marketing than substance."

I bought it for my 9-month-old, who is borderline anemic and refuses solid foods. While the flavor is pleasant to ME (sort of like apricots), it is too strong for his taste; I tried mixing it with water, expressed breast milk or some juice, but he would either spit it out or gag and throw up.

319613,0,"This protein bar tastes great, however the major problem I have with this protein bar and the other flavors with this brand is the amount of sugar alchol. While they claim only 2-3g of sugar, the rest is compensated with 26-28g of sugar alcohol which is way more than one person should have. The amount of sugar alchol gave me the worst case of gas I had in a long time which is simply not ideal for working out in a gym full of big angry scary men yelling all the time if you know what I mean. I think if they were to decrease the amount of sugar alcohol and compensate for a little more actual sugar to keep the sweet taste, it would be smart move."

270888,0,"When I eat a packet of this oil, the first taste that hits me is an unpleasant bitterness. Then a thick, overpoweringly artificial ""orange"" flavor. Then the sweetness comes on, but it too is overpowering--it does take away the bitterness but it's so strong it's unpleasant in its own way. The aftertaste is the artificial orange and a slight bitterness, but it disappears very quickly if you eat or drink anything (which can't be said of fish oil!)I will still be buying this because I believe it's a quality form of omega-3 oils, but I could not call it delicious by any stretch.Cons: Tastes bad: Too bitter, too sweet, heavy ""artificial orange"" tastePros: Quality blend of absorbable omega-3 oils, tastes less unpleasant than plain fish oil (with no ""fishy"" taste), convenient single-serving packets, and though the taste is unpleasant it is quickly and easily removed with food or water (unlike regular fish oil, which tends to linger.)"

You will notice that the battery compartment is, as Randy Jackson would say ""just OK for me, dawg.""In all seriousness, this is a decent trimmer.

234293,0,"Wizard Aerosol, the manufacturer of Air Wick Lavender Field air freshener spray, proudly boasts that Air Wick spray eliminates odors in your home--and they are right. This easy to use aerosol spray does indeed promptly and permanently remove unpleasant odors in your home.It's easy to use: just spray it in the direction you want it to go for about 30 seconds. That alone should solve your odor problem. Unfortunately, this type of Air Wick air freshener adds a heavy fragrance that only mildly resembles a lavender scent into the air in your room. I was never 100% pleased with this product.Unfortunately, I have to take off at least one star because this comes in an aerosol spray can; and that can be hazardous to the overall air quality here on planet Earth. Please keep this drawback in mind before you choose to purchase Air Wick Lavender Field air freshener.Overall, however, Air Wick does do the job--it just doesn't do it as well as some other air fresheners I have tried. The smell it causes may be offensive to some people; the scent just doesn't please me. The aerosol can is another drawback. Sigh."

The answer seems to be yes because the usual benefits of even the mildest dosage of kava kava are not present here.

143103,0,"I have used these wipes for about 2 years for eyeglasses (never, ever, use them on camera lenses- more on that later!). As a typical eyeglass wearer, I am a frequent user of this product. As many other reviewers wrote, I find them suitable for eyeglasses, barely. The biggest problem with this product is the residue left behind following typical use AND streaking (in my case). Although the wipe clears away salt, body oils, and other grime, there always appears to be a film and streaks left behind. Not sure what it is, but it is annoying.CAMERA LENSES: I use a Nikon D200 with a number of very expensive lenses. I fall into the ""prosumer"" user of DSLR's and related equipment. Believing the product was indeed a lens cloth and therefore usable on any lens, I used the product on a $1,200 Nikon lens. First, it did not react well with the lens coating, leaving streeks and the typical residue. I worked on that lens for another hour, reverting to a Nikon lens cloth (all I use now), which resolved the issue over time. Therefore, if you are thinking about buying this product for your camera lenses, save yourself the aggravation. While the wipe will not destroy your lens, it will keep you busy for about an hour fixing the residue and streak issues."

The choclate was supposed to be milk choclate, but looked like it had been melted and was white and chaulky. The caramel had melted in them and reformed at the end of each bar. They were horrible. The only good part was that customer service re-credited my credit card the full price for all of them. Like I said...these bars are normally REALLY good, but I recommend buying them at a store like SAMS, NOT online. As far as flavor goes I would have given 5 stars, but do to the condition they were in I only gave 3 stars"

373084,0,"Review of Norelco 8151XLBefore I bought this shaver, I read all 131 reviews of the 8140XL(a very similar model) on amazon, and was concerned, since many reviews were from previous norelco owners, who beleived that the newer norelco was of much cheaper quality than previous ones. I'm writing thislong review mainly to address worries that I had, which will hopefully help others in making their decision.My last shaver, a Norelco 5811XL(Quadra line), I had for over 6 years, and the shaver and battery still work fine, but the trimmer broke a few months ago, so I've been planning to buy a new one for a while. I was never thrilled about the ease of shaving, I always had to make manypasses, and if the hair was too long, I either had to trim my face first or endure some pulling. A bit of a PITA, but I still found it much easier and more convenient than a blade. So I don't expect amazing results from this shaver, but I expect it to work at least as well as my previous model.The main things that drew me to this particulat model is the ability to rinse it under water, the larger surface area of the blades and their potential for a quicker or better shave, and the lithium battery.Here are a few downsides to the shaver:- The travel pouch cannot hold the power cord, just the shaver(with or without the cap, contrary to one review), and the brush if you want.- The protective cap does not fully enclose the heads, so it doesn't prevent hair from falling out of the heads like previous caps did. This was possibly done to aid in drying- The power cord is not coiled, and has a transformer on one end, making it bulkier than with previous shavers, which had the transformer built in.- The ""automatic"" charging stand does not autmoatically shut off, so you have to remove the shaver after its done charging. You can use the cord without the stand, but you still have to unplug it when its done charging.- replacement heads/blades are most expensive yet: The ones I saw were $40.I knew all these issues before I purchased it, and was concerned, but I realized that there are some benefits even to these disadvantages. For example, the pouch without the cord is more compact, and for most people a fully charged battery will last at least a week(I think the advertised 17 days is an exageration, however). The new cord would be annoying if I have to travel with it or move it, but it makes it easer to leave it setup in the bathroom with the stand. Also I expect to rarelyneed to travel with it, especially since mine came with a free car charger, which does have a coiled cord, which I can easily leave in a seat pocket in my car.I preferred the old caps, which prevent the shaver from making a mess, but if you rinse the shaver after each use, that shouldn't be an issue(as I mentioned I beleive the new cap was designed to allow it to dry). I still would rather have the old ones, and just dry it with the cap off if necessary.There is nothing about the charging stand that is automatic, that is a false and blatantly misleading statement. That said, I find it a bit more convenient than plugging the shaver in(which you can still do), and is no worse than older models in this respect. The stand can be left plugged in, just remove the shaver once it's charged.Some advantages:- quick & easy to clean - no cleaning solution to buy- long battery life, low battery indicator- The case is semi-rigid and has more padding(better protection), and is slightly more compact- Does not feel cheaper or lower quality than my older Norelco(contrary to other reviews)- dual voltage transformer, like previous models- charger stand is more stable than I expected, and optionalOf course what probably matters the most is how well it shaves. It's not much faster or much closer than my previous Norelco, but maybe a little of each. My skin does feel smoother after a shave, but I can plainly see the hair anyway. I still have to make many passes in some areas and usually miss a few hairs, it's almost impossible to get everything. I should also mention that I hadn't changed the blades on my previous Norelco in years, so any improvement could simply have been due to freshblades. There was a significant amount of irritation, even though I've always shaved with an electric, it took a few weeks to get used to it. The blades must be set closer to the screen than prevous shaver, as I also managed to nick myself more than once, and that's the first time that happened to me with an electric in my life. The trimmer is about the same as previous Norelcos, it works fairly well.Bottom line: The shaving quality is mediocre, but If you were happy with previous(but not ancient) Norelcos, and the power cord and other issues above are not deal-breakers, then you will probably be satisfied this one."

325538,0,"Well, I was excited as ever to try this product as an alternative to a traditional statin. I originally bought the 60 pill bottle, then the 240 pill bottle. I took a physical before and my scores were as follows:12/06: total choles. = 252; triglycerides= 154; HDL= 42; LDL=179; and VLDL= 36. I took Cholestoff for approx. 3 months as prescribed within 15-30 mins. before meals. Then I repeated a physical ad my results were are follows: total choles.= 251; TRIGLYCERIDES = 260!!; HDL= 36; LDL= 162 (great and as advertised!); and my VLDL's = 52!!!So my synopsis is as follows. The product did appear to do what it said in terms of lowering my LDL levels, but at a sub level it grossly affected my triglyceride level as well as my VLDL (very low density lipoprotein). For the past 4 annual physicals before taking this product, my triglycerides have always been in the 120-181 range, with my most recent measurememt being 154 as stated above. Additionally, my VLDL levels for that same period have always been within the range of 24-36 (within normal limits), and this last testing threw me out and above of normal limits.So, choose what you will about trying the product... I am only writing because I consider myself an educated consumer, and tried to read as much as I possibly could find on this product before trying it. I wanted to extend my story so that people have a balanced view of the product as recorded by test results.I am now off of Cholestoff and will not take it again. However, I have not given up on trying other products, and will see for the next 3 month period the effects of taking ""Oilsmart"" fish oils (3, 6 & 9), along with and ayurvedic supplement from Solaray called guggul. I will let you know how that turns out.Good luck!D"

219798,0,"I purchased these batteries (4 pack AA, eneloop) about one year ago. The price was about the same as it is today on Amazon, so the price hasn't changed in about 12 months.I have been happy with the performance of the batteries as they have held ~99% of their rated 2000 mAh claimed capacity over the year I've had them. Of course, I've only charged them a hand full of time, probably 5-8 times total given the small amount of use they see. They've worked great.Then I tried to use a set in my Guitar Hero guitar. It refused to power on. I swapped the batteries around (meaning I took the batteries out and swapped their placement in the device, not that I had installed them incorrectly). Nothing. I took out a pair of disposables and the guitar fired right up. I figured that the batteries had lost their charge and decided to give the charger a shot.No dice. I am using theLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Charger. The nice thing about the charger is it has a display that tells you what the charge rate is, capacity and so on. One of the eneloop batteries would NOT charge. The display shows ""NULL"" on the display while the other battery in the pair charged all the way up to its 2000 mAh rating with no troubles.All I can say is ""buyer beware."" The eneloop batteries are great; hold capacity and work really well. The problem is that if you have one of these batteries die on you as I have, you would be better off just buying disposables, considering you can get 30 packs for pretty cheap these days. And like another reviewer here on Amazon stated, Sanyo support expects you to mail the failed battery back to them... cost of shipping a single battery makes these batteries even more expensive. If I were asking for a full set, I'd understand them wanting them back, but a single battery? I tossed the battery (disposed of properly actually) and will look into other rechargeable options."

They are identical, even though described somewhat differently. I thought they would be different, and ordered both so I could see which I preferred. (The Amazon sold one looked just like their picture). The only reason for ordering this product would be if you want only one bottle and don't mind the higher per bottle price.The product itself is quite good and I regularly use it in coffee (and was trying to replenish my supply and learn if this product was even better than what I had gotten earlier when purchasing from Amazon). Like others, I believe (based on considerable reading)that the artificial sweeteners have health problems and have decided to pay the extra price for Stevia."

96993,0,"I have owned the frio wallet for about a year now. I do not feel that it keeps the insulin cool enough. I put it straight from the fridge into the prepared frio wallet and when I remove it about 2-3 hours later, the insulin vial feels just a few degrees above room temperature. I was under the impression that it keeps it at the temp that it was when it went into the wallet but this is definitely not the case. It's a shame because it is a good idea in theory but I just don't feel comfortable using it for extended periods of time. Furthermore when the wallet is expanded after being in the water it is extremely difficult to stuff the insulin vial into it and even more difficult to get it out. I read that Frio advises to wait for the wallet to start evaporating...who has time for that when you need to leave the house at that moment??"

I'm still taking it because I need it and I spent all that money for two bottles, but when they are gone, I'm looking for something else. This can't be healthy for my colon.6/8/11: Just opened the second bottle. It wasn't damaged and the seal was intact, but when I pulled back the seal, powder blew out all over the place. I poured all the capsules out to inspect the contents and there were 6 caps that were completely obliterated and the powder was all out of them. WHAT A MESS. There is no way I won't be handling that powder every time I pour a couple out into my hand for as long as this bottle still has caps in it. I just called the company and they told me to contact the seller on Amazon, so that's what I'm about to do.

And they break on indented/recessed seams, where it's impossible to patch them with any kind of vinyl patch kit. I just have to throw them out.For now I think it's worth it, and I just replace them when they break. I usually get a couple years of occasional use out of them first.

To me comfort means relaxing on a pillow that you hardly notice as you lay there, you don't have to figid with it to try to make it comfotrable.As another reviewer suggested - it digresses in comfort with time; It started out being a 4-star product. It's great as a hugger pillow for a side sleeper like myself, and is comfortable if you wake up on you back; it's just trying to fall asleep on it without wrestling with it that presents a problem to me.I would not purchase another and have already tossed it aside."
208225,0,"I had hoped that the vibrating section on my clitoris would cause the perfect sensation all around, but it's just too lame for my taste. He and I totally get off on the size and feel and uniqueness of this tool, though! It's great for me to exercise and strengthen my muscle control with trying to hold that bulb portion inside while using this on him, but I hadn't anticipated THAT being as challenging as it is! The stout size is longer than I anticipated, but it worked out perfectly anyway. Overall, great, fun toy for those into this kind of action. I'm hoping they modify the bulb for easier vaginal grasping and know that there can NEVER BE TOO MUCH BUZZ ACTION ON THE CLIT! LOL!"
428725,0,"This stuff is fine for the money but I have realized I'd rather get my calcium from the eggshells of the eggs I am already using. Why pay more money for a supplement when you're probably throwing out calcium every day?One whole medium sized eggshell makes about one teaspoon of powder, which yields about 750 - 800 mgs of elemental calcium plus other microelements, i.e. magnesium, boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, sulphur, silicon, zinc, etc. There are 27 elements in total. The composition of an eggshell is very similar to that of our bones and teeth.All you have to do is take the shells from raw eggs (rinse them first!) or boiled eggs, lay them out on a baking sheet and leave them out overnight to dry. Then grind them in a coffee grinder. I've read that they can be stored in a glass container but I just keep mine in a ziplock baggie.Think of all the plastic bottles you won't add to the landfills by doing this! :)"

They are fairly comfortable and havent tested their absorbability yet but for disposable underwear this is a reasonable item. They can be worn straight or the sides torn and refastened for a tighter fit.

119209,0,"I bought this maybe 6 months ago. I'm a big fan of g-spot stimulation and this toy sounded promising, so I thought that I would give it a try. First off, out of the package, it was a lot bigger than I expected it was going to be...longer than I was expecting (but not too long...it makes for a nice ""handle"" to hold onto, which you need with something like this) and also fairly thick. This is a hard rubber/plastic type material, so there isn't much flexibility to it at all. I guess as far as G-spot play goes, that's a good thing, but it did make it a little difficult to use at first considering its size. Nothing you can't get used to though.Some have complained about the smell and compared to a lot of other sex toys, this one really didn't smell that bad. Yes, when it first opened it up, there was a plastic smell, but it faded off after a few days and after being washed (a lot of toys it seems like you can't get rid of it no matter how hard you try!). The toy was nice and smooth, didn't have any weird mold lines or anything like that. Color is nice. It's easy to clean and the twist controls are easy to use.The vibrations are nice. The motor is in the head of the toy, not in the base, so it's more of a deep, rumbley vibration, which I think is best. And since the motor is there it's quieter than expected when ""in use."" If it's just out in the open and turned on it can be pretty noisy, but when ""inside"" or in contact with skin the noise is muffled.Overall, I do like this toy a lot, but there has been one downside...after a few months of moderate use, I noticed a number of times where the motor would ""stall"" or suddenly go a lot slower than it should be at the speed that it was set on. At first I thought I just needed to change the batteries, so I did that, but it didn't help. I noticed that if I shook it around or held it at a different angle (one that you wouldn't normally hold it at to use, of course!), it would start back up again. Something somewhere isn't connecting right :( I don't know if that's just a problem with the one that I got, or if it's something that is prone to happen with all of them.So, it's a fun toy, but not the greatest quality and doesn't last too long...BUT, it also didn't cost that much, so in the end, maybe it is worth the short life."

279612,0,"When we first got this tub, we loved it, especially the infant sling! The sling was easy to clean and change the water. But as our daughter got bigger, the tub would slide around in the big tub when we'd lift her up to clean under her (around 18 months old). So we just moved her to the regular tub after that.However...as time when on, a layer or scum built up around the ""legs"". I couldn't find a cleaning instrument that would fit down there to clean it out! I tried scum sprays and tried q-tips. So it could use it's own scrubbing brush just for those hard-to-reach areas! I'm looking at other models for my second child."

We ordered this product not knowing the scale did not read below 8. We wasted our time and money due to lack of disclosure regarding hemoglobin scale limitations.
337843,0,"I bought this for my gas stove top at the local hardware store. Followed the instructions to the letter and it didn't work that well in regard to getting of burned on grease. I had to apply several times, allow the product to penetrate, and then scrub away. Eventually, I ended up buying another product off the Internet which completely removed the stain with minimal effort.I also used this to clean a induction cooktop and it performed much better doing a thorough job and leaving no streaks or residual build-up.Just my observation, but this is probably a good product for glass cooktops. I wouldn't advise using it on gas cooktops. It doesn't seem to have the grease cutting power needed to tackle difficult messes."

It seemed to give him a smooth shave and then a week later he stopped using it. He said it was too rough on his skin. I think it's just because he's sloppy but just be careful and slow, because it is a harp blade."

356538,0,"I purchased this walker because the one I've used for 30 years, manufactured by Guardian, has been discontinued and I've had a hard time finding a replacement. I liked the looks of this Cosco model. However, it has a lot of play in the legs and swerves back and forth 3 to 4 inches. I'm surprised, because altogether it's an ingenious design. My coworker drilled a hole in each leg and placed a bolt through each, which added some stability, but now the height cannot be adjusted. I also removed the original wheels and added scooter wheels (four), but because the diameter of the scooter wheels is smaller, the walker tilted forward a bit and was front heavy. Because of that, I took a fall this morning in the bathroom, hitting my ribs pretty badly. So, ""Plan C"" is to but two more Cosco wheels, put all four back on the walker. I think this will make it the most stable I can get it. Now, how long the walker will last altogether is yet to be determined.I am 5'8"" tall and 170 lbs. I'm not a big guy, but I need a stable walker. This one disappoints, though I may be stuck using it."

I actually have to cut back on using it because when I was taking it I was gaining sometimes 3LBS a week so that is far too much weight as you can only gain muscle max about 1/2 lb muscle a week. I always got the strawberry as it tasts OK (all suppliments taste bad, but this stuff is bearable), and tastes even better then any protein powder that I have been using. This stuff also has a lot of FAT in it which is necessary to eat if you want to gain weight.To sum it up if you want to gain weight or are a skinny hardgainer , this stuff simply works.

48353,2,"this product tasted very bad in my opinion. it didn't matter what you mixed it with or how you mixed it, it still tasted bad. Egg whites as you know foam up a lot when shaken or stired, so it was really hard to try to use this as a protein shake. The reconstitued egg whites from the powder tasted like leather or rubber."
392785,0,I have liked everything about this bath for my daughter other than there are two areas that are almost impossible to get in and clean. I like all my baby gear to be easily cleanable and this is not. The only way to get in there is with a bottle brush or something similar. These two areas are perfect places for bacteria to collect especially in a nice moist environment like a bathroom. Maybe for some this is not a big deal but it bothered me. Other than that she sits in it very comfortably and the mesh was nice when she was a newborn.
328669,0,"This silver cleaner undoubtedly does its job well, and most of all does it with very little odor involved. Kudos for that.So why only 3 stars? Because the packaging really does not work for me:When I first opened the jar, the contents were under a clear seal that was absolutely impossible to remove without a tool. I had to use a pair of scissors to get a hole into it and even then was unable to simply peel it off. Gloves are very much recommended if one doesn't want skin to come into ample contact with the chemicals contained in the jar. In addition, I had a hard time closing the jar again. The lid kept catching the thread at an angle, and when I finally got it on straight, the chemical solution came up bubbling from underneath the lid upon attempting to screw it on tightly. I believe the problem is that the flexibility of the material used for the jar and the lid is simply too great. In order to screw on the lid, one must hold the jar and also use some kind of strength/force to get the lid on. That leads to everything bending slightly out of shape - just enough for the product to make a royal mess. I for one got the stuff all over my hands.I would normally be inclined to say that I just got a jar with a bad thread but with the odd flexibility jar and lid have, I just don't think so and believe the problem is with the design. As much as I despise the odor of theConnoisseurs Silver Jewellery Cleaner 8 oz., I think their jar is designed better. At least it used to be on my old silver cleaner I had from them.I don't think I will buy this product again although I do like its performance."

320892,0,"Our glass and tile shower requires the use of this product every day. Over the years we've used many different squeegees. This squeegee gets high marks for being easy to use and effective. It moves smoothly over glass and tile to wick off the water. The size is perfect for dealing with some of the areas that are impossible with larger squeegees. It's also nicely quiet when going over tiles - not like some that sound like you're driving on the bumps in the middle of the road.The drawback is that this only lasted a couple of months before the rubber blade started leaving ugly streaks of rubber all over our white tiles. The squeegee is stored above where the water reaches in the shower, so I've no idea why it decayed so quickly. I've never had a squeegee die so fast. So be forewarned, it's a very effective tool, but it may wear out very early compared to others.We're going to give it one more try in the hopes that our first one was defective."

Even with the objectionable smell, it still DOES NOT have a bad or fishy taste thank goodness. I might try another brand, but this brand does seem to do what Krill Oil is intended for, and that's get rid of joint pain."
422762,0,"I thought R-Lipoic Acid and L-Carnitine were being used to treat Neuropathy. A deficiency in some of the vitamins in this product could be a contributing factor but don't stop there, I don't believe this offers anything to relieve the pain. I have poly-peripheral neuropathy and I am searching for ways to get relief. There are some medications, but you have to cope with the side affects too...and I don't want to have to live with the nightmare that narcotics can cause. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Self Hypnosis appears to be the most affective. For those without affordable medical care, I have found several self help books and CD's on Amazon. It is a terrible disease but I'm not going to let it take my life from me. Wishing you the best."

199937,0,"This product was just as described. However, the hinged seat is not at all stable. The only thing holding on the seat to make it hinged is a very small plastic knob on each side of the seat that is barely stuck into holes on each side of the back part you see flipped up in the picture. Any shifting of weight on the seat caused the seat to un-attach and slip off the toilet. This almost caused a serious accident with my 89 year old uncle, but the hand rails we also installed stopped his fall.As this item can't be returned, and he really needed a seat riser immediatly, I modified it. I drilled holes through the knobs all the way through the side of the seat and put in long bolts with a large washer that can't pull out of the holes. This modification still allows the seat to hinge for easy cleaning and completely stabilized the seat."
348766,0,"Broke my leg and ankle and was anxious to be able to shower. Ordered this and indeed I was able to slide it over the cast with some effort, and happily was able to take a shower and keep the cast dry.Unfortunately the gasket/seal tore as I was taking it off, so I only got one use out of it. Sort of expensive for one shower!Going forward, I used a trashbag and water-proof medical tape, and that did the trick... Perhaps I had bad luck, but this product was too expensive to only use once."
111289,2,"What can I say about this garbage that hasn't already been said. The thing shocks you every time you put you foot in it.

So if you like shock therapy bye one for yourself, but if you don't bother......SAVE YOUR MONEY, IT IS NOT WORTH IT."

154621,0,"As a dentist who stresses flossing to my patients, I am not one to promote products I don't personally use. But as I counsel every patient, new and existing, every day, I've come to the realization that flossing manually is not something people are going to start doing or start doing routinely for life. So what I did was purchase this Waterpik Flosser and just got it in today. I read the instructions manual completely and read all of their claims, such as easy to use, ergonomic, minty, and whitening effects. Well... I already have my own first impressions of the product, but as I do with all things, I give every product some time so that I can give a more accurate impression. But to keep you from all of the suspense, I'll list some of my first impression takes:1) it is not as straightforward. You can't simply take it out of the box and start using it.2) it requires 24 hours on the base before using. Not good for those people excited about opening up boxes and using it right away.3) if on a durability scale from 1-10, it appears to be a 6.4) it comes with 45 tips. refills run about $5 for 30 tips. That makes it almost 17-20 cents each tip. They recommend using a new tip each time. And depending on their use, it may require more than one tip per use. VERY expensive. Then again... nothing dental is cheap.I'll provide more details later as I am writing down all I need to so that I can make an accurate review on this and place it on my smileiq site with other reviews.Right now... I recommend it if flossing with the cheap string is totally out of the question. Secondly, if you have braces, implants, crowns, bridges, this is a must-get even if you floss."

Unfortunately after using it dilagently for 10 solid days the only change that I noticed was that it really messed up my diet! I was hungry all the time! I had been doing so well and had been at such a steady weight for about 2 years and then I use this light for 10 days and suddenly I'm up 3 pounds then 5 pounds! So I quit using it but it took several weeks for my body to readjust but now I'm not hungry all the time anymore. Too bad because I was really looking forward to the benefits of the light like not being tired all of the time and having more energy and getting more done and being more myself but I didn't notice any of that. I still felt like I needed a nap, I still had a hard time getting up in the morning, I didn't notice a mood change. The only difference I noticed was my hunger lever. I was very dissappointed.

However the 3 large pieces with huge suction cups stick very nicely. Wonder why the tennie tiny ones were even put there to start with? Don't waste the money on buying one with the small suction cups as I know of no one that it works for. The place where the hose attaches to the mat never stayed, only long enough to get layed back. Noise also was a problem. Couldn't hear a thing and could wake sleeping children. My suggestion: Don't use duct tape and Start saving for a real tub"

Even after trimming the stem completely off, I can feel the bottom of the cup ready to protrude. If it's pushed in any further, it doesn't create a good seal and leaks or doesn't open at all. After doing more research, I have learned that the Diva Cup is the longest of all the mentrual cups; I wish I had bought one of the shorter versions. At this point, however, I'm hesitant to invest in another brand. Part of the reason I did this was to save money. What a huge waste of money!

160552,0,"I bought this thermometer when I was pregnant with my third child. It came in handy, with all three pieces storing in a compartment on the back of the unit. Unfortunately, the shelf life of this product was only about two years.Readings were quick, but were not very consistent, especially with the underarm attachment. I would take a temperature and receive a reading, then immediately retake the temperature (using the same attachment as before) and get a reading a degree or two different. That is a big difference. And the red light didn't always light up when the reading was high.As for durability, I can't give it a high rating in that category. The unique design that allows three attachments to be used, in my opinion, also weakens the attachment connections. My youngest managed to snap the oral attachment apart, which broke that piece. The other two attachments can be used, but who is going to use a rectal thermometer on anyone older than a baby? And since the underarm thermometer has the most inconsistent temperature readings, I'm not inclined to use it either.So we're searching for a new thermometer."
12466,0,"OK - very excited to receive product as plantar fasciatis is acting up horribly again. After good reviews I decided on this product. Felt some improvement after using for about 5 to 6 days. However, on about the 7th day woke up in night to big toe on that splinted foot hurting like crazy and has been hurting ever since (2 weeks later to date). Feels like electric bolts running through it which indicates nerve pain or damage. I used the product for about 2 more nights after the toe started hurting and tried to adjust position of splint, but pain got so bad in toe that I could not sleep and I had to stop using the splint. I believe that the way the foot was held in place and the way the tight velcro band comes across the ball of the foot pressed into my big toe long enough to pinch a nerve. A strange side affect that I hope goes away. I am curious if anyone else out there has experienced the same problem?"
351556,0,"These warming footies is a good idea, but one-size-fits all is not a good execution of it because they don't stay on my (small) feet.In the winter my feet get so cold that I have trouble falling asleep. I purchased these footies to wear them at night when I sleep but the booties slip off my 7.5 sized feet while I sleep. Putting them back on requires enough effort to really wake me up.However, I am came up with a solution that really works much better for me. I found stretchy socks into which I inserted my own home-made microwavable inserts. Since a few other reviewers mentioned the same issue I am going to describe how I made my home-made booties. Here is the description of how I made them.I measured the length and width of my foot and created two strips which were 1 inch larger than my measurement in every direction. I cut strips out of strong dense cotton fabric. I put the right side fabrics together (the side I wanted to be on the outside) and I stitched 1/4 inch around them 3 times leaving only 1 inch opening on one of the narrow sides. Then I turned the fabric inside out, stitched around it one more time, still leaving 1 inch opening. Then I filled the bag with grain (I used barley, but round rice will also work well) and then stitched the opening closed by sewing it several times for strength. I did not over-stuff the bag, the grain can move easily and conform to my foot.Before I got to bed I put these bags into a microwave for 1.5-2 minutes, and stuff into the stretchy socks, which I then put on my feet on top of terry socks I normally wear to bed. Perfect! Warm and comfortable, the bags stay on my feet all night. Even when they stop being warm, they provide extra insulation and my feet has been toasty all night.This solution cost the under a buck for fabric and barley/rice. I have been using the same bags for over 1 year, and they are still working perfectly every time. I hope this home-made option will help someone else!Ali Julia review"

379027,0,"First, let me say that this kit was a LIFESAVER when I went on a trip and my baby got a nasty cold. The kit is compact and easy to pack. I slipped in an infant tylenol too. The nasal aspirator and thermometer came in very handy. However, I wouldn't rely on this kit as your only care items. The nasal aspirator is stiff and small - the one from the hospital is MUCH better for at home use. The thermometer works fine but doesn't beep, so it is hard to figure out when you are done taking the temperature of a squirmy baby. The nail clipper is ok. It isn't too strong, but then again I would be afraid to use something sharper to cut my baby's nails. I haven't yet used the other items."

305396,0,"I HEARD THAT THIS THERMOMETER IS THE MOST ACCURATE, COMPARED TO THE EAR AND UNDER THE ARM READINGS. I DO AGREE IN THAT ASPECT. I WAS ALWAYS PARANOID ABOUT MY DAUGHTER'S TEMPERATURE WHEN SHE WAS A NEWBORN. WHENEVER SHE CRIED UNCONTROLLABLY, I WOULD TAKE HER TEMPERATURE. IT WAS GREAT AND ACCURATE. THEN WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS 14 MONTHS, SHE HAD A FEVER FOR ALMOST TWO DAYS. IT WAS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TO GET A READING AT ALL. SHE WAS DISTRACTED BY THE BEEPING NOISE, THE FLASHING LIGHT AND SOMETHING RUBBING ON HER FOREHEAD. SHE KEPT TURNING HER HEAD. SOMETIMES IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THE THERMOMETER TO READ THE TEMPERATURE, SO YOU HAVE TO HOLD THIS THING OVER AN UNCOOPERATIVE BABY AND WAIT FOR THE THERMOMETER TO READ THE TEMPERATURE. I BELIEVE THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE THERMOMETER IS DEFINITELY THERE, BUT TO OVERCOME ALL THE OBSTACLES OF GETTING THE TEMERATURE MAKES THIS ITEM UNDESIRABLE.

The only Fit 'n Fresh product I've not experienced this problem with is the Healthy Food Snacker, and that's because that lid screws on. I've resigned myself to going back to Lock n' Lock containers, which don't feature the built-in coolers but which at least feature flawless sealing and locking capabilities, no matter how many times you run them through the dishwasher, on ANY rack.

170643,2,"I really liked this monitor when I got it. It's easy to use, and the strips cost way less than other meters. My diabetes is type 2, and I've been on metformin and diet control for about 15 years. I keep a very close watch; when I can afford it I test 4 times a day.Suddenly my blood glucose was reading 130's to 150's before meals. I put it down to stress and maybe less tight diet. I tightened up my diet control, made sure I was getting enough sleep. Sugars began reading 160's to 300 before meals. I don't have health insurance and I had no way to get in to a doctor over the weekend. Before we went to the ER my husband said ""Don't you get nauseated and sleepy when your sugar goes high? If you just feel a little tired, are you sure the meter is right?"" He's not diabetic, and he did a pre-meal test at 124 (he's normally 80 or less).I went and bought a bottle of One Touch strips for an old meter I had, and it read 125. I got 165 on the TrueTrack.I found out I have to send the meter back to be recalibrated and wait for it to return. No suggestions on how I monitor in the meantime. They consider 20% variability to be acceptable. My readings were anywhere from 20-40 points off. Now, most sliding scale insulin based on how high your blood sugar goes over a certain number, in increments of 10. I think 20 to 40 off could be a real problem for anyone taking insulin.Fortunately I'm on oral medication and increased that according to my doctor's directions, which just made me feel rather nasty. If I had been taking insulin to correct I could have gotten into serious trouble. Also, TrueTrack's meter reads low (LLL) at 20 and high (HHH) at 600. With those blood sugar results it would be really unsafe to drive, or you might not be able to call for help before you blacked out. My current meter reads LLL for low at 40, giving me time to get some carbs in and/or get help. Since you're not always the brightest thing on the planet when you're having a critical low, it helps when the meter practically screams ""Do something now!"" in time.This is a great low cost meter for someone who wants to casually monitor and is willing and able to verify on another meter or at their doctor's office if they start getting strange results. If you're trying to go it on your own with only minimal doctor visits and no health insurance, save yourself from diabetic complications and spend the money for a more expensive meter and strips.There's a discount card program called Together Rx Access you can find on the Web. You can watch for strip sales, and some internet sites have almost-expired strips you might be able to use before the expiry date. Ask your doctor how infrequently you can get away with testing to make the expensive strips last, and if they have any samples from the reps. I've learned my lesson. I would rather test once a week and when I have symptoms and have it be accurate, than test more often on a less accurate meter and get into trouble."

This is the same brand our pediatrician uses, and they are also familiar with temperature bias in this thermometer - and it's never been a problem. More than once, I've checked on my daughter in the middle of the night and taken her temp without disturbing her at all. I've given this as a gift, and have yet needed to replace the battery.

314910,0,"I am a computer geek and digital artist. I started experiencing the onset of CTS after ten years of computer work, finally caught up with me even though I spent time and money on good ergo equipment. Turns out it was the arms of my chair, now removed, that lead to the dmg. This purchase was a necessity and here is what I think of the product:It helps. I'm still a bit sore after my first couple days with this brace and one other that turned out to be to small. It keeps my wrist from bending in extreme computer sitting positions with my mouse hand and I wear it when I sleep with no issues. So in that area, it is worth it.It has good ventilation. It can get hot here in cali and I have not had problems yet with sweating or to much heat. Seems to breath nicely.The strap on both ends is a nice working velcro strap of soft cloth, just what it should be and it works. The strap in the middle is one of those stretchy bands a nurse would wrap your tennis elbow in with velcro on the end of it. The stretchy part is nice in that you can set the desired tightness of the overall portion of the brace, the part that sucks completely is that the velcro adheres to this material so well that your slowly shredding away the fibers of the stretchy band thingy. Now I'm not exactly a small guy, and I have problems tearing this blasted thing away from itself every time I try and take it off. I would like to see an old woman try to remove this band, I'm pretty sure she would hurt more parts of her body then the part she was trying to heal. So to you older ladies, gents, and toothpick arms beware. You can get a small workout from this elastic band and velcro if you wear and take off this brace all day long.On a side note, you can wear this brace to tight and to loose as any other. It will also cause Decubitus sores if you wear it to long, this goes without saying though as sleeping on a wrinkled pillow can do the same thing."

128950,1,"Ear candles of this nature have been used for over 100 years by Native American tribes, as well used in eastern medicine for longer. The flame produced creates a vortex that gently sucks out any debris clogging your ear canals. When used properly, they work wonders. Be careful about overuse though, using them too often can cause dryness and irritation. It's recommended to use these about once a year, and upon the first use you may need to use 2. I've been using these for years to keep my ear canals clean and unclogged, and they've worked wonders for my hearing as well as balance. The fluffy yellow stuff is melted wax from the candle itself, it's the hard brown stuff that is actually sucked out from your ears. Highly recommended for anybody who wants a natural approach to ear health."
208774,0,This safe-t-sport neoprene knee support is very good but there are some drawbacks to the support which I found out. The support does what it advertises to do and you have to measure the upper leg above the knee to get the right size. The drawback is not to wear it more than an hour or so as it will make your knee sweat. I also have poor circulation in my leg that I use the support on and in doing so after 3 hours or so my knee will swell. Not life threatening as you have to remove it to feel better.

386810,0,"Ok, so I only received my product a week ago and haven't been using it long enough to give a full review. HOWEVER, I have already been showing signs of getting back on track with my ""cycle"". I usually go about 8 months between cycles, and my dr said their is nothing wrong with me, but since I prefer to use wholistic products, he recommended Vitex. It was cheaper on Amazon than in my pharmacy, so I bought it here. Anyway, yesterday after only 6 days of using Vitex, I had premenstrual cramps, and today I started my cycle! I was shocked it worked so quickly for me. Like I said it is too soon to tell if it keeps working, so at this point I give it 3 stars and a lot of hope that it keeps working!!!!"

I have mixed with Greek Yogurt with Strawberries, mixed with Milk, mixed with oatmeal and have the same unpleasant taste not matter what I mix it with. Not sure I can finish this product. I called Symbiotics customer service and they claim the aftertaste is normal. I use non flavored whey protein isolate all the time and even though sometimes it has an aftertaste, its never been as bad as this. Just thinking about it is ugh! I really want to like this product! But may have to return it."

The cucumber smell is nice, but the cleaning performance isn't quite up to regular powder. I've had a few occasions where soap remained on glasses, and some food residue remained. Generally, I'm happy with it, but I watch for it on sale rather than buying at full price."

I placed them in the appliance for which I bought them . . . not once . . . not twice . . . but three times . . . each time checking to see that I had installed them properly. Next I installed them in a flourescent lantern . . . nothing . . . I will not buy Energizer batteries again.

337489,0,"Not as good as the old Golden Retriever. I get frustrated when clothes keep slipping out of it. The grip has to be very firm. Yet it will pick up a penny if flat. I have one in the kitchen, bath, laundry and bedroom. Really do help. Better than most. They do keep me from have to bend over and it is letting my leg and knee heal from an injury."
175131,0,These are NOT individually packaged pairs like most of the cases sold out there. This is fine for individual use but may not work well for multiple employees at a big company for instance. They will not stay clean in the field for long if not used right away without individual packaging.

207685,1,You can't beat the price for the quality. Even at major discount retailers you'd pay a whole more. My husband has very sensitive skin and these razors don't give him the after-shave burn or rash other razors do. I give them 2 thumbs up!

268508,0,"All the other reviews of this product have something in common: they all exaggerate the goods and bads of the product. Existing reviews either claim Clear Care is the best thing since sliced bread, or that it's worse than using battery acid to clean your contacts.When it works as advertised (90% of the time), this seems about the same as the other top-notch solutions in terms of wearability of the lenses. Maybe slightly better wear time, and maybe slightly better protein removal (evidenced by lens clarity with old lenses). A little bit less convenient than conventional solutions. Definitely a bargain for what it cost (about half of what conventional solutions do). The solutions costing less than this one are generics that are harsh on my eyes (they seem like they were made with hard water or something). The Clear Care solution works great as far as comfort goes. I would have a hard time recommending this to kids, since if used differently than directed, it could cause some real ""owies."""

222105,0,This unit works - but I find it can create leaking batteries - destroys them. It seems a work around is to not try to fully recharge. I suggest letting the batteries charge for only a few hours.
317428,0,As other reviewers have said the new formula is too sweet. I believe that when they changed to Stevia sweetener they added too much.
204434,0,"I bought this a few years ago when I was living on a very noisy street, (and at street level) and I was happy with it for the price I paid. It didn't completely cover up the noise but that was more the fault of the drunk people going home at 2 am than the machine. After awhile I became increasingly disappointed with the sound quality. Essentially my issue is that it started to sound like static in the background, like when speakers get blown. I've only used this with a wall jack, so I can't comment on the portability. I completely forgot there was even a heart beat option because it was not soothing for me at all, but I'm sure for babies it would have a much different result. My favorite noises were rain and the summer night (crickets), I generally find ocean waves very soothing but that sound in particular had static. Maybe this was just my machine, maybe my roommate dropped it and I didn't know about it?In addition I tended to use it all night (on the continuous setting) because otherwise it would wake me up on the auto shut off timers, and eventually the button and light for the timer seemed to malfunction and shut off whenever.I've recently started using the sound machine again and needless to say, I'm shopping for another sound machine. The Graco model sounds like it's good quality, but I wish there was a way to better evaluate/determine sound quality online. Sigh."
222509,0,"The Kiwi Shine Sponge is fine when you are in a hurry and need a quick touch up. Don't push too hard with the sponge on your shoes the first few times (ie. follow the directions) as you can definitely stain your shoes. Nothing a good professional shoe shine can't handle, but still an inconvenience. Also, I am worried that the sponge won't last longer than 10 or 15 uses."

I've tried over the counter sleep aids (a shovel to the head), earplugs, valerian root, teas, schedules - you name it. When I first started taking this both my boyfriend and I tried it together - IT'S AMAZING. We both found that our sleep was much more restful, hard to wake us up, and much more soothing than prescribed sleep aids (they do something that's not Kosher). 2 of these, 2 vvalerian root pills and I am ni-nite PERIOD. If you don't know what the alphabet soup I listed at the beginning of this is look it up and you'll see that if I can sleep on this anyone can!"

236028,2,"I received this cologne and gave it to my Boyfriend for Valentines Day. This is his favorite cologne and the only kind he wears. When he sprayed it it smelled like leather, oil, greasy after shave. When I tried to contact the seller they didn't reply. Thank God Amazon refunded me when I filed a claim against them. I'm a busy student and I work so I was NOT happy that I had to deal with this. Seller still hasn't contacted me. PATHETIC."
97144,0,"Not sure if is becuase I am not using the product correctly or if it is just the product.

323695,0,"The price is very reasonable, but the life is shorter than what I would expect compared to others I have used. I don't think I'll be buying anymore of these, as I get better life out of others I have used,,,In actuality,rice/val, it is a draw,,but having to change batteries in the middle of a session is frustrating."
399215,0,"I bought this product because i have a fungus on my big toe and as i am breastfeeding i cannot take any internal meds. Upon purchase i read the booklet provided and what jumped out at me, was that the product is named Funginail but the info book states that it is not for your nails and will not work if placed on nails. The only reason i have not returned it is because my toenail is hollow and as such i am able to put med under the nail and on my skin. I have been using for 3 weeks now and it seems to be improving. The directions however say not to use for more than 4 weeks which i think may not be enough....but i shall wait and see and update as i go"
315546,1,Very rich but still refreshing smell and actually found it energizing. Maybe it id s form of a aroma therapy?

46328,0,"I purchased this product as an option for when I didn't want to wear lipstick but still wanted to give my lips some color as well as moisturize. Unfortunately, I found that Almay Pure Tints are only so-so in this role. I have the featured color, Blush, which provides only the barest hint of quickly fading pigment. In addition, what color that is present is somewhat uneven, and the product has a slightly grainy feel. On the other hand, the SPF of 25 is nice, and the product did help to moisturize my lips; I also like the slim design. However, if you are looking for a cross between a lip balm and a lip stick, Blistex Lip Tone is a better option."
319866,0,"I took these for about 3 months as recommended by the bottle, without changing any other part of my schedule. I had exactly the same trouble sleeping as ever and continued to wake up tired. I couldn't find any studies that seriously suggest these pills work unless you live in the Arctic and have a real melatonin deficiency. I guess they're just placebos? Anyway they didn't work for me."
348583,2,It doesn't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed. I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor. Atleast It has a taste.
75632,0,Tasted ok but didn't really work for alleviating nausea. The only thing that worked was waiting to progress in the pregnancy. It's a tough road but eventually you feel better. :-)
134955,0,"New model quieter, less vibration than old unit, but water capacity is much less and it has less power (smaller, cheaper motor I'd guess). If you're fast, you can make a whole mouth on one tank. BUT, unless you apply continuous forward pressure with the index finger on the knurled thing that holds the insert that pokes into your mouth, it has an annoying tendency to turn so it's difficult to keep the water directed at the gumline. Also, the hose on my old unit sprung a leak and was irreparable, so I bought an extra hose assembly with this unit in case it is no longer offered when the current one inevitably springs a leak. Why can't products made in the U.S. hold together??!! Anybody know of a good Japanese manufacturer?"
236122,0,"The cologne is great, but the bottle was damaged (assumed from shipping)...lost about 1/3 of it and it was a Christmas present.Otherwise though, this stuff is great-"
120149,0,"Echoing some other reviews here. I bought this for use in my car, but am finding it too large and bulky. Contrary to others, I found the fit to be perfect and really liked how firm it was. Definitely provides a lot of support. The major issue is just how large it is. My upper back is way too far away from the seat and I feel off balance sometimes. Adjusting it further up helps a little, but then it's not providing as much lower back support. Overall a good product, just more ideal for an office chair than a car."
410308,0,"About the only way to rate a fish oil supplement is by whether or not it gives ""fishy burps"". This one does. A lot. And I love me some Dr. Weil. I got those because I trust him and if you take 2 it's got as much epa/dha as the Minami Nutrition ones, which are more expensive. But the Minami ones taste of lemon and they don't give fishy burps at all. So, I'm considering going back to them if I can find them cheaper than I originally did at my local health food store."
172994,0,"This product is cheaply made and I would expect it to have sold for a lot less money. They should make a washable cover for the foam area, too. Think of all the dirty necks and hair. Yuk! Time will tell if it helps with the tension in the neck. Don't plan on purchasing anymore of these."
2871,0,"I have used many brands of HCL as I have to take it prior to eating in order to avoid severe stomach pain. I picked up the Solaray recently when my go-to brand was out of stock. While it does work (it is HCL, after all) you don't get much bang for your buck. While I only take 2 pills of my go-to brand before each meal, I had to take at least 5 Solaray capsules to get similar results. It would probably be a good choice if you need a low dosage of HCL, but if you are like me and need around 1200mg with each meal, this is not the economical choice."
306457,0,"If you are a man looking for heavy or medium strength grip - do not waste your money on any of these. X-Heavy I got are in reality light.

It may unintentionally make a normal ear drum look abnormal."
369119,0,"this looked like a great product, the most expensive. It was very difficult to put on, perhaps the measurements were to be with the cast on. It got 2 holes in it after the 3rd or 4th use. But the first few times worked great. My daughter did complain her fingers got numb, so it gets very tight. I would recommend it for short term use!"
193578,0,"I have not made a definite decision yet on how I like this product. I have only been taking the product a little over 2 months. The label advises that you may need to take the product in excess of 3 months for the full benefits to be felt. I will be reordering and continuing the product for a second trimester. If at that time I don't achieve optimum results, I will discontinue use of the product."

I used to have the problem of what to do with batteries for devices that I didn't use every day, NiMH batteries would only hold a charge for about a month it seemed, so I'd buy disposeables. Now I just buy Eneloop NiMH and things are great. I also found some research that showed these are better than the extended charge NiMH batteries from other manufacturers."
196766,0,We have this for 5 years. I dont think this device is anything magical. It is just the temperature method and nothing more nothing less. I am saying this if you miss a date the device start panicing. It will put more yellow days all along. this is a lame device.
160251,0,"I have had Remington electric curlers for many years and many sets. I am sorry that I do not like the clips that go on the rollers and prefer the metal ""picks"" that stick around them. I have saved the picks form the first set I had but that set also had pockets in the front to put the picks. Now the plastic clips go in a separate container and are very hard to attach to the curler so it doesn't slip and holds tight. Please go back to making the set with the pockets in the front of the curler container with space for the horseshoe metal holders. Much better. If you have more of that type of curler with holder, I would like to know the model number and would exchange this one in a minute for one of those. I even have a set for England with the correct attachment so I love these curlers and the size of the container. I just don't like those plastic clips. Judith S. Block"

I found that the fit was good, but for support my hernia kept protruding. I am 58 and am active, but even in a suit and tie in a non active situation it seems just walking this belt would not hold in the hernia, which is on my left side. This support truss is very comfortable to wear, so if they could put something for support more rigid and cover a bit larger area I think this could be the best because of the comfort . . ."
43392,2,"I developed varicose veins in my second pregnancy and was able to control them quite well in my legs with compression stockings. When I started to get these veins further ""north"" I didn't know what to do. Going to the bathroom, taking a shower, even standing could be almost unbearable. That is why I was willing to shell out the big bucks for this product. I could not wait for it to arrive in the mail and relieve my discomfort.Unfortunately, when it did arrive I was very disappointed. It was easy enough to put on but all I felt was more discomfort. It did not relieve the pressure at all and the velcro was so stiff that I felt like I couldn't walk comfortably. There are two velcro straps that also cut right across the butt cheeks which not only pressed on one of my veins but the sharp velcro dug in and was painful. Since the whole thing is basically just a bunch of velcro is also makes noise when you move. I have also had problems with my hips and SI joint but this thing was too uncomfortable to wear to find out if the hip brace works or not.I thought I would do anything to get rid of the discomfort of my varicose veins but it turns out the one thing I will not do is wear this terrible contraption. I returned it. I don't know if there are other products that work better but this thing is likely not going to be comfortable for any pregnant woman... and frankly I just don't think it really works."
322786,0,"I waited to review this product. The winter months really chaps my skin, especially my lips and hands. I purchased this product in hopes of keeping my lips from drying out. It works OK, but it is a bit of a hassle. I think a regular lip balm works as well, but the mask does help exfoliate the dry skin from the lips. It works ok....not fantastic. Worth the buy/try if you suffer from day, cracked, chapped lips as I do. I may purchase it again if my lips prove to stay cracked free this winter."
402533,0,"Says it's accurate up to .01, but I'd say it's accurate up to about .02 at best. You must wait at least 20 minutes before your last drink or you will get wildly inaccurate results, which the manual states in its defense. I bought this as a party favor, but it's not real user friendly for that purpose. Great tool is your want to test if someone is fit to drive if they haven't had a drink for 20-30 minutes, but not real fun just to see how drunk your friend/guest is just for s**t's and giggles, which is why I bought the thing. Bottom line is that the device works, but is not as accurate as it states and it takes some abstinence to be ""accurate."""
275305,0,Shaves great but the green indicator light which is supposed to flash when fully charged never flashes. I just have to leave it charging for 12-24 hours and it does seem fully charged by then. But it does shave great.

I have an older dishwasher and think that maybe only those evil phosphate detergents are strong enough for me right now. In an effort to keep on the planet-friendly side, I've been trying other detergents and found that the e-cover tablets work best (although I really don't like individually wrapped tablet form).I assume/hope this detergent will work better in a newer dishwasher, but it's not great in my 8-year old one."
103140,0,"This is great idea: more than one brush or flosser can be sanitized at same time. However, we've had to replace it about every year due to the deterioration of the on/off power button and connection.

By that, I mean 2 pills in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, and 2 in the evening. These pills are quickly metabolized and burned by the body, so you have to take them throughout the day; otherwise, there's no benefit (at least that was the case with me). If I missed a dose, or forgot to take them for a day or two, the fatigue would return.again, this product is helpful (as a mild and safe energy boost) if you take it consistently.

We have to use both mattress pads at once to cover most of the bed but now we have to launder them more frequently. This pad is probably better for a toddler bed than a twin bed."
350902,0,"The product description says to measure the circumference of your knee. Mine is 19 inches and the product description says a XL fits 18 to 20 inches. Maybe it's because i'm about 100lbs overweight. I'll keep it in case I loose a bunch of weight, but I'm ordering a XXL instead."

424585,0,"I'm only on day two, but my teeth seem noticably whiter, which is a shock, because my teeth are relatively white to start and it's hard to find a product that makes any difference at all. It was very painful to apply them today, the peroxide burned my gums very much to the point where they turned white near my teeth. I toughed it out though, and the pain wore down after a few minutes. I did have problems all day though, it was a constant pain in my upper and lower teeth, I'm really hoping it's just temporarily sensativity. I also recommend applying lipbalm before using, because your teeth will probably get chapped. Let's hope the pain dies down, because they seem to be working!"
159535,0,"Let me first say, overall I am pleased with the performance of this trimmer. It met all of my expectations as an inexpensive facial hair trimmer and lasted about as long as you might suspect, in my case a little over a year. If you're looking for a high quality device that will stand the test of time, look elsewhere. But for under $20 this thing is a hell of a lot cheaper and more convenient than a years supply of razors (assuming you don't mind the 5-o-clock shadow look) or even a single trip to a professional.Other than durability, which is not great by the way, one minor complaint I do have about the design is that it is very easy to press the button that detaches any given shaving/trimming piece for the device while you are in the middle of using it. On more than one occasion, I would accidentally tap the release button and send the beard trimmer flying across the floor of my bathroom. After a year or so of use mine doesn't even turn on anymore, but some will probably have better luck. For me, it's time to shop around for something different."
413483,0,Good quality. Good number of capsules per bottle. Does it work? The effects are hard to determine but if Dr OZ is behind it I am willing to give it a long term try. Couldnt hurt.
62314,0,I was having trouble with sciatic nerve back pain and thought this might help. It doesn't. I think it is too soft to do anything. It just crumples up behind me and I really can't even feel it. Maybe the firmer one would be better. Buy the book on back pain by McKenzie instead as that really does help.

357425,0,"I have to smile while reviewing this as to the name ""Holy"" clearly due to it's revered nature, and long history in alternative medicine. I just wondered if it would sell as readily had it been called ""Pagan"" Basil or ""Satanic"" Basil, but I digress.This is a clearly subjective review, for me I noticed little or no effect from this homeopathic supplement, except some occasional ""flowery"" reflux.That's not to say for one second that I discount ""alternate"" supplements, or remedies (don't we all take vitamins?)I did however read recently that the much fancied Ginko Biloba has now been proven to have zero benefit to mental ability or warding off dementia in the elderly as was once thought to be a benefit, so I always remain a little skeptical about natural remedies.However, there is a lot to be said for natural products, although one must realize that what works in nature, may not always benefit 21st century lifestyles.I'm also a firm believer in the subjective belief in these products. How many times have we heard stories about people who have given up on recognized modern medicine only to be cured, or comforted by alternate and homeopathic treatments?Over simplifying maybe, but if you BELIEVE it's working, chances are it probably will, in some way or other.Be mindful of allergic reactions (always a necessity with plant based supplements) but by all means give it a try.I only gave it 3 stars as for me it did nothing really, maybe I'm too skeptical, I don't know.At a little of 35cents a tablet, it seems a little pricey, but then again, prescription medication is not exactly cheap."

211581,2,"I was very disappointed in this aftershave. I love the smell of sandalwood, as I have The Art Of Shaving sandalwood shaving cream, which is amazing. I was hoping for something with a similar scent to complement the shaving cream, but it was not the case. This smelled like the perfume my grandmother had in 50 year-old Avon bottles shaped like airplanes and animals. Unless I received an out-of-date or a bad batch, I cannot see how this can smell good to anybody. It has a musty, moldy smell, which stays with you all day. If you want a good Sandalwood aftershave, try the Art Of Shaving sandalwood aftershave lotion. It smells exactly as it is supposed to, without the mold stench."

215321,0,"There's nothing special with this stuff, according to the pic there are multiple of items but you only get the third bottle, from left to right.

Other than that I can't see much more of a help this can be."
194585,0,"Great idea - and cost is reasonable. However, like some of the other reviewers, when I received my box of disposable thermometers, many of them had already been activated, and were no longer usable. I have used these several times, and they appear to give a good temperature reading. I like the disposable feature, and will likely purchase similar product in the future, but will not purchase via the mail. Not confident that the warehouse handling or shipping protects these well enough to keep them from being activated ahead of time.Based on the cost, I did not return."
229358,2,"As I'm getting a bit older, I'm finding that I sometimes wake up with neck pain from the angle I sleep on our Select Comfort bed. Let me say right off the bat I'm even suspect that the bed may be part of the problem.Living in remote Alaska, I bought two pillows, one soft and one hard, without trying them out. The first couple nights I received some relief from the pillow, but as I tried to break it in, I found the sides, top and bottom of the pillow very hard. And this was the 'soft' one! It's almost like trying to sleep on the arm of a chair, it's that hard.Silly me, while trying it out, I took off the plastic. That immediately voided my return policy. Now we have two of these and the best I can do is wrap them in plastic and send them to charity.Don't buy these pillows, they don't work. I originally tried a Tempurpedic pillow at my in-laws that worked very well. I'm going to buy one of those and write these two pillows off as a loss."

222363,1,"Maxell makes a great battery; and these batteries will show you just how good they are made once you try them. I always get several hours more use out of these ""Gold"" Maxell AAA batteries; and that's grand!Of course, these ""Gold"" AAA batteries can be used in anything that requires them--portable radios, CD players and more.In addition, use these batteries before their expiration date. The expiration date will always be roughly five years into the future; but some people still have them lying around in a dresser drawer anyway. The problem is not only do they lose their potency; the batteries also begin to corrode. When the batteries corrode eventually a whitish powdery sticky substance begins to leak out of them and this makes a mess--trust me!Do NOT dispose of these or ever place these in or near a fire. They could indeed explode. I wouldn't carry them loose either--they should be protected in their cardboard case or they should be already installed in your flashlight or whatever device you placed them into.Overall, these Maxell ""Gold"" AAA size batteries are simply excellent if you need AAA size batteries. I highly recommend them for any device that needs AAA size batteries.Use them in good health and enjoy!"

93219,0,"I do like this deodorant, the price is a little more than usual I like to spend on toiletries, but I wanted a unique product. The scent isn't too strong, but it does seem to help in stopping the sweat. The scent is pretty plain, was expecting something a little more unique in that sense; but overall a decent product especially if you want something plain without an overpowering smell; only question then is it worth the premium price."
93966,1,I've used these for several years and just recently purchased additonal pads for travel and gifts. They always work great to provide 15 to 20 minutes of penetrating warmth.

I expect medium to fit a waistline of between 30-36, but this was way too small, and should have been labeled small. At least the vendor should have provided a sizing table on the web site if their sizing is non-conventional. Luckily someone else was able to use this support. It's a hassle to return and reorder."

167754,0,"I got this product because I have sensitive skin and hate razor bumps that I get with a regular blade. Ive had this now for about a month or so, and I use it every other day.I dont think I would buy this again, honestly. I dont know if there's some special tecnique for this, but it just doesnt get the hairs. I can tell it has shaved a little, but no matter how many times I go over and over it just doesnt feel smooth, and it always misses hairs, no matter what I do. I paid around $30 for this with S&H.; Maybe if you find this for like $5 bucks I would say go ahead and try it, but I wouldnt reccomend it otherwise."

356571,0,"I had my hopes up for this massager with so many good reviews, but I found it to be weak. If you like vibrating massages, then this may be what you need. However, applying vibrations to my sore spots really didn't do much. It also felt annoying holding it in my hands because it would make my hands really tingly afterwards.I bought a Homedics Shiatsu massaging cushion, which even though it is not for on-the-go use, is really effective.I'd say save your money and pass on this little gadget."
392377,0,"We purchase this for my elderly mother. She has poor circulation in her legs and uses it to prevent sores. It works great, however as others have said the pump quits working long before the product is gone. I weighed what was left in a 14oz bottle when the pump quit and there was a full 6oz left. It is so thick you can't poor it out. I cut the bottle off above the product to get at what was remaining. So just be aware that if you throw it away when the pump quits you are throwing away almost half the product. I have made Gold Bond aware of this through their web site and am awaiting a responce."

I LOVE all the other Method products I use (Glass cleaner especially), but this just is not tough enough, even when used with a heavy-duty scrub brush.It just cannot compare with something chemical when cleaning a tough shower or tub. It's fine for maintenance on a generally clean shower or tub, but not one that has been neglected, especially on the soap scum. The smell is great, though, and I still use it as often as possible as a good alternative to burning my nose with the other stuff."

392730,0,"I registered for this tub and from what I read it was one of the better ones. However, the tub does not fit in my sink and it is a double sink. We have to angle it and so it does not sit level. We tried every possible way but the tub is just too big for our sink.Also, the hammock while it is a good idea seems a huge disappointment. Our baby kept sliding down in it and it literally takes two people to bath baby. One person has to hold him up, otherwise he slides all the way down to be laying with the water level and the second person has to wash him. Also, the hammock gets ICE cold when wet. Since the hammock doesn't sit directly in the water, except in the center, the padded head cushion gets wet and gets very cold. I was very shocked after the first time we used it.Even though we have used it twice now and baby is only 14 days old I am not happy at all with this tub to date. It is too big for our sink, the hammock gets cold, and baby slides down into the water.Also, I have never noticed the plug to change color... we have always used the rubber duckie with the word HOT on it.... that has indicated water being too hot while the tub plug never changed.Would I get this tub again? Seeing that this has the highest ratings out there probably, but I would not put high expectations on it."
52290,0,"I bought this for my Mother who needs more exercise and outings. She gets winded quickly, due to emphysema, and needs to sit down. This product is better than a plain walker because of the wheels, and the seat, but it is hard to get in the car or the trunk of the car, the handles stick out. The walker folds in but the handle stick out takes up the whole trunk and the majority of the back seat.I have a 4 door Nissan Altima."

351531,0,"I bought these to wear when I sit at my desk and my feet get cold. However, I found that they are really only suited for bedtime. They are constructed in such a way that they are really hard to slip on and get over the ankles--and I don't suffer from swollen joints. Another consideration is that the ""bean"" sacks--the part of the warmers that actually heat up in the nuke--are slipped into the *bottom* of the warmers, so you *cannot* walk on them. The directions say to remove the bean sacks to heat up in the nuke, then slip them back into the warmers. I did that the first time, but it's inconvenient, so now I just put the whole thing in--no problem so far.In summation, these are a great idea and do warm the feet nicely, but the design is flawed, which creates inconvenience and limits their use to bedtime."
219519,1,"I found these over a year ago for my company and now we have 50 set for 50 photographers in the field. The best part is slow discharge when stored! They work great with Nikon Speedlights, SB600 and SB800! The recycle fast and more frequently than alkaline batteries."

224665,0,"This electric razor is good, not great.The shave is not super close (though I wasn't really expecting it to be).My biggest complaint is that the razor ALWAYS misses hairs - you have to go over areas multiple times to even get that not-close shave. I wanted to switch to an electric razor to save time (and also because it is supposed to be better for ingrown hairs). I think that shaving with this razor actually takes longer than just shaving with a regular razor in the shower!The good thing about this razor is that it is okay to use both wet & dry which makes it very easy to clean. You can just run it under the tap and you're good."

If you are looking for a great whey protein look no further than Myofusion hydro whey the taste is out of this world, its easy to mix (unlike EAS which leaves crap in your shakes unless you use an actual mixer), its cheaper, and the quality is unbeatable unless your going to spend 80 to 90 on a 5lb thing of protein which would be wasting a lot of money.

317494,2,"Unbeknownst to me, the new formula was shipped to me. I used to love this stuff. It worked great and tasted palatable. I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it. That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin. Also they lowered the amount of calcium and changed other ingredients. It sounds like they reformulated to reduce costs. I can't use this rubbish. I want my money back and I'll have to try something else."

378768,0,"I love the size of this tub and I love the bath ring. My toddler still uses this tub. We use the bath ring for him when he sits and plays for a long time or we take it out when we're right next to him. It is a great size in that you dont have to fill your tub - and it is just big enough to play in.I hate it because it does leak. We had the locks in place and everything was correct, then 8ish months later the tub started slowly leaking. Then more quickly - had to do a quick bath or no water would be left! I contacted the company and they sent us a new one. Was very happy for awhile but now, again, about 8 months later we are having the same problem! It is slowly leaking. My hubby has decided that they are designed to be a ""one kid tub"" - to only last about a year or so. Annoying cuz I really do like the size of it. Not sure what I am going to do about this now, it leaks on and off and sometimes it leaks faster than other times. Strange.I also have mixed feelings for the sling - my baby does slide down easily. While I am always there to move him back up, its kind of a pain. Tho Im not sure what could be done to fix it cuz the way it is now, its very easy to wash him - without having to move any straps or any parts getting in the way. Trade-offs I guess.So all in all, I would get this tub again because there is no other tub that is designed like a small bath tub that I know of. It just stinks that the middle part has to be so leaky."

172467,0,"This transport chair was purchased for my mother who has just had her 92nd Birthday. Up to last year she could use a walker, but recently even going 20 yards was too much for her.With this light, compact chair it has been easy to move her around the seniors residence where she stays. It has allows use to visit more people and get to other floors and facilities with ease.It should be clear the person in the chair can not wheel themselves around, as it only small wheels.It is light weight and compact which makes it easy to manoeuvre in tight spots.The two brakes are at the back and can only be operated by the carer, which is fine. However, from our experience, if there is a change in carers, there has been cases where someone has tried to move the chair with the brakes on. This forces the brake mechanism out of alignment and may have to be re-adjusted.This is a low cost product and represents good value for money.

189198,0,"Based on other reviews, I was hoping this Whey Protein Isolate would blend undetected with my regular fruit smoothie and unfortunately that isn't the case. I tested the smoothie prior and it was my normal tasty/sweet Raspberry/Blackberry/Blueberry/Banana smoothie and I combined the 1 scoop in after the rest was all blended and I definitely noticed the difference. It definitely has a bit of an aftertaste.Keep in mind however, I am very picky and subtle differences are very noticeable to me. Did it completely destroy the shake, no, but it took me over 45 minutes to drink the 32oz shake where I normally slurp it down in less than 20 mins. I suspect that probably any of the unflavored protein powders or isolate will modify the taste slightly in a similar way, so this is not necessarily a knock on this particular brand. I will most likely push on through and finish the 1.2 pounds of protein and might experiment with adding stronger berry mixes to counteract the protein taste. If I can come up with a mix that makes the protein less noticable, I might stick with it, but if not I may try a competing brand when it's gone."

However, Amazon's care, custody, shipping and handling is horrible - in the summer - the bars arrived melted, stuck to the wrappers, adulterated and virtually unusable. Amazon has done nothing to correct the problem to my knowledge. Thus, perfectly good product is ruined in shipping, sitting in hot warehouses or trucks and arrive plastered to the wrappers, flattened and altered. Beware when ordering these bars in summertime as they will melt when a common carrier such USPS or FedEx is used.

334271,0,"I bought this shortly after I got braces. I chose this model because I don't have the counter space in my bathroom for the big tank and it was a reasonable price. I only use it once a day and worked great. I did notice that I had to fill up the tank 2 times sometimes 3 to get through one cleaning. I am ok with that, its not that annoying. However, after about 4 months of use it completely died and wouldn't charge. Since this model has a 2-year warrenty I contacted Waterpik and they sent me a brand new unit with in a week. They suggessted that you remove the pressure tip after each use because water that is left inside it can seeps back down inside and in the battery housing (it doesn't tell you that in the directions). I have done that since I got the new one and have had no issues. I don't have to charge it very often. I was very please with Waterpik for quickly taking care of the situation. I think others who are complaing about the battery losing charge and buying a new one should have taken advantage of the warranty information. Overall, I do notice a difference with the use of this water jet, it helps a lot with braces. Even though I did have charging problems too, I was very pleased with the quick response from Waterpik. I would recommend this to any one who doesn't want to spend a lot or doesn't have room for a large tank model."

It takes longer to charge and I also need to go over my face more with this newer model than that of the older ones.Today May 10th, 2007 I just purchased a new Braun Electric Shaver. This is my second Braun and hopefully it works better than the older one.The old Braun Foil always seems to tear or rip, causing cuts etc on my face.

189866,1,"Doc Johnson has created another great product: Jenna's Perfect Pair. It stands up well (pun intended) against Dani's molded breasts which are also on the market, and the older ones of Rocky Road which are no longer being manufactured. In my mind, Jenna's Perfect Pair are the best. They're definately more perky than Dani's. The mold sure looks like Jenna's breasts and the UR3 product is soft and durable. The only down-side is that the coloring around the nipples isn't accurate and wears off easily, but I don't see that as a real problem. Amazon had the best price I'd ever seen and their free shipping offer sealed the deal. I'm happy with the product and very satisfied with Amazon's simple ordering process and super fast shipping."

107395,0,"I've been a happy camper taking the Rainbow Light Men's One daily vitamin (Rainbow Light Men's One Multi, 150-Count). As a matter of fact, I did notice an increase in libido within a couple of weeks of starting on Men's One. However, I will admit, sexual energy was only a bonus. I chose Men's One based solely on the fact it was a high-quality, everyday vitamin. That's what I needed. But I figured, hey, if the Men's One is that good, maybe I can step it up even further by taking the Performance Energy!Well, after 6 weeks, I can honestly say I have felt no difference between the two.Now, I'm not saying I'm giving it 3 stars because it's a bad vitamin. Far from the truth. It's an excellent vitamin. I'm giving it 3 stars based on value. I'll tell you why.On a side-by-side comparison, both the Men's One and Performance Energy are complete in your everyday, run-of-the mill vitamins and minerals. The formulas are like 85% identical. The difference is that the Performance Energy has up to DOUBLE the amount of your energy-giving B Vitamins (B1, B2, B3 etc.). It also has an additional herbal blend that the Men's One doesn't. I'm guessing this is the stuff for the sexual energy. Both vitamins are rich in Super foods and antitoxins. Both vitamins do contain 'the agreed upon' herbs that are touted for prostate health (Saw Palmetto, Selinium, etc) so this isn't an issue.So what's the issue? You need to take 4 tablets daily of the Performance Energy vs. 1 tablet daily of the Men's One. Therefore, a bottle of Performance Energy will last you 45 days, and a bottle of Men's One will last 150 days. Wow! Even if you doubled-up and took 2 tablets daily of the Men's One to receive the same amount of B-Vitamins that are in the Performance Energy, you'll still have 75 days worth of vitamins. And the Men's One is $5 less per bottle here on Amazon.In my opinion, the Rainbow Light Men's One is a complete and high quality vitamin that will do nearly everything the Performance Energy will at a substantial savings. If you're looking for a little better libido, Men's One worked for me. You may want to consider this before making a decision.One last thing to remember that most reviewers don't seem to realize. Vitamins are NOT medicine. When you take medicine, you can usually start seeing results in less than 48 hours. Vitamins need weeks to establish themselves in your system. So whatever vitamin you decide to take, give them enough time before deciding whether or not they have provided the benefits you were looking for!"

I had almost been too discouraged to try another heating pad, believing that the lawyers and assorted consumer nannies no longer allowed heating pads to heat. Not true with this one.OTOH, I consider the bulky control and the stiff cable to be substantial drawbacks to this product. The control is the size of a largish TV remote, the kind that fills a man's hand. Maybe this is necessary to accommodate the ""computer control."" (What'd you think...they had a little three-position switch?) Even worse than the bulk of the control is the stiffness of the cable from the control to the pad. This is not a subtle point...we are talking seriously stiff here. The pad is awkward to maneuver with all of this hardware hanging off of it."

Otherwise, cost value, it's realy affordable for a 5 day cleanse that could do wonders for your body."

I had to ring myself with my fingers just to remotely stay hard enough, but by the time I got the mold goop in the tube, it was lumpy and I just jammed my willy-nilly in there long enough to get something - the most distorted and deformed mold. Went ahead and mixed the gel together and poured it in there. Upon removing the mold hours later as directed, the dildo came out more like a furry sea creature. The lumpy mold let the gel set in every line and crevice and resulted in a 'harry' creature like thing.

With regards to the product, it works quick and there was no confusion with the results. The red cross stopped matching people's blood for free and since his friend needed it pronto and you can't donate more than once every month and a half (don't quote me on that), we needed the test done quickly. Since he doesn't have a doctor, this was our only choice and it turned out to be a good one. I've read some complaints about needing too much blood for the test. You actually need to place the lancet on the correct part of the finger in order to get a good blood flow, and if you do it correctly, you'll have no problems getting the amount of blood needed for the blood. Just google ""how to do a fingerstick"" and a bunch of resources can help you out"". If you don't have access to a computer at the time you receive the test and complete it, just remember to make sure your finger is warm, that you lightly massage it for a minute beforehand, and hang your arm down in order to pool the blood. If you due this, you should be fine. After you do the test, let it completely dry flat and then place the protective covering over the card. If you put this in your wallet and happen to get in some sort of accident requiring an immediate blood transfusion, the EMT personnel will end up giving you O neg (universal) blood anyways, as they aren't about to take our word for it. Even so, it doesn't hurt to keep it on you, until ""DNA identity theft"" becomes popular in the future. But until then, I think I'm better off with it in my card."

270623,1,"If you are a believer in Applied Kinesiology (muscle testing) and you frequent practitioners of this natural health care method, then you probably know about Standard Process products.

Schmitt, Jr., D.C., a disciple of Dr. George Goodheart who developed Applied Kinesiology, and made great strides in developing the philosophy and practices related to natural healing (seeCompiled Notes on Clinical Nutritional ProductsandCommon Glandular Dysfunctions in the General Practice: An Applied Kinesiological Approach). An excerpt from the first work above called ""Vitamins Every Medicine Cabinet Should Contain,"" can easily be found with an online search. From this you can begin to tap into Dr. Schmitt's wisdom by which he recommends the use of Zypan (or Hydrochloric Acid) among other things.For instance, he lists the following common conditions:1. Excess sun exposure symptoms (any)2. Canker sores3. Cold sores including oral herpes simplex, lip, cheek, and tongue sores and ulcers4. Genital herpes simplex5. Sore muscles after exercise6. Hives7. General itchy skin8. Pruritus ani (itchy rectum)For this he recommends the combined use of three products easily found among Standard Process products: approximately 6 tablets ofStandard Process Calcium Lactate 330 Tablets, 3 to 6 Vitamin F (Cataplex F 60 Perles), and 3 Hydrochloric Acid (Zypan).He also mentions other uses for Zypan in the article. I have had great success in following his methods. My Chiropractor is a disciple of his. She sees him as one of the true pioneers of natural medicine as we know it.

The bath crayons that come with the holder are good, but I noticed that the holder doesn't hold the crayons all that securely and it's easy for them to slip out. At least that's what I'm experiencing with at least one of the slots.The holder suctions to your bath wall and you can place it anywhere.

382664,2,"As a commercial software designer (i.e. geek) studying vipassana meditation for a couple of years, I thought Journey to the Wild Divine would be perfect for me. I was intrigued by having biofeeedback accompanied by interactive teaching of Eastern breathing exercises but the product just didn't deliver.First, the lightstone monitor isn't the most comfortable thing to wear so it begins to distract from the mental exercises.Second, the game itself is frustrating in many ways. Unlike pure role playing/adventure games, the continuity in the screens and the stories is lacking. This makes it frustrating to figure out where to go next. And if you've just had a lousy day and just want to de-stress, it's tough to have to jump through goofy hoops and listen to the accented new agey wisdom when you want to relax. Unfortunately, a less enlightened shoot-em-up game often seems to do the trick better.Finally, the game's poor performance made it tough to stick with. Screens can take a while to load and the dramatic music can be repetitively exhausting.Overall, I'm thrilled that someone is venturing into the biofeedback game space with a title that explores different mental training techniques. But, the execution on this title just wasn't enough to keep me playing. The new agey teachings/voices/music seemed to be poorly thought out and not steeped in any accepted traditions. The experience itself seemed like they were trying hard but I just couldn't reach any kind of peace with it.Anyway, a good meditation/dharma book (or 10 of them for the current price) would have been a better use of my money."

201343,0,This is a decent set but I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews regarding the size of this set. Let me just say this was either created by or for the KEEBLER ELVES. I can't imagine what kind of idiot would make such a small set. I took it out of the box and me and my wife were cracking up at the tiny size. It really looks like a childrens play broom & dustpan set. I guess you can use this for fast clean ups and small rooms. If you're planning on getting this for large jobs/rooms FORGETABOUTIT!
6110,2,"The mop head has to be replaced after one mopping of a floor and tears easily. EVERY SINGLE REVIEW has been bad, which should tell you something. Finally, if you are considering the Mr Clean Magic Eraser mop, same issues. Don't bother.I love the Magic Erasers, which you use to clean walls, so I had high hopes for this product as well. But it just isn't worth the money or storage space!"
265188,0,"I guess the product works, but it takes some co-ordination to deal with three loose components. Stethoscope, cuff and the dial gauge."
326281,0,"I like the idea of a big magnifier, and one that is 5"" fits the bill perfectly. Unfortunately, the magnification power wass not stated anywhere on the product page when I purchased it. It's merely 2 times magnification. For me, it has limited usefulness.At least Amazon has corrected the problem."
236537,0,I only used the massager for a short time but it seemed to be adequate for the sore shoulder I had at the time. I was also using topical medications so I'm not sure how effective the massager was.
95043,0,"On the one hand it is quieter than my old Braun, and seems to take the 7000 series screen and blade, on the other hand the head doesn't tilt and battery life seems shorter."
286976,1,"I love the smell of oranges, it just makes me feel happy and uplifted. So since I don't have too many around the house I figured I would buy some orange oil. It is lovely. I put it in my diffuser and my whole room smells like oranges. Great for helping you wake up if you're not a morning person or if you have difficulty getting up in the morning. If you don't have a diffuser just hold the open bottle under your nose and take a few sniffs. It's strong but very pleasant."
35259,0,"Supposedly I have a copper deficiency and was prescribed copper sulfate. No drugstore or pharmacy could fill this prescription so this item was recommended as the next best thing. Honestly, I can't tell if it has any effect on me, but I'm still alive!"
406707,0,This item does not fit well and it rolls down from the upper portrion of your arm. After one washing it looks old and worn.
261002,0,"This carrying case came with the massage chair that I originally ordered from Amazon in 2007. I've had to buy another case as the first one's wheel casing cracked. The same thing has happened to the second one that I bought in April 2009. I've had to epoxy the casing so that the wheel doesn't fall off again. Aside from the wheel inconvenience, it is one of the better massage chair cases out there. It has a large pocket in front that is convenient for supplies."
79894,0,"It is been years since I have used an electric razor and upon trying this model for the first time, I was disappointed at the slowness of the heads. I thought the rpm would have been a little faster giving a faster shave."
7195,1,Wife says it is AWESOME. Well made not cheap. Is very quiet for its size and for the amount of circulation you get.
114643,1,i just got this Braun A week ago. WOW! this product is everything the five stars mentiod i own a norelco and this braun kicks it's ass. this is the closest shave you will ever get from a foil shaver closest to blade shavers. i hope braun never discontinues this product. i highly recommend this Braun Series!
92373,0,"The wings of the pads stick so well that sticky pieces of the pad stick to your underwear. On more than one occasion I had to try to scrape and pick pieces off which took forever. I don't like wearing ""granny"" underwear when I have my period but I don't want to ruin my cute ones either! With the same stay free ultra thin regular I did not feel wet. With these pads I feel wet and uncomfortable often. I might try a heavier pad (without wings) through seventh generation before giving up hope."
247851,2,This product would have been perfect except for the shaver head was poorly designed. After about 1 month of usage...it becomes loose and falls off every easily.
151022,2,"I paid more for this product because it was described as being in tablet form. (Many medical dictionaries describe a tablet as round and compact). In fact, it is a long, thick capsule. If you have trouble swallowing, this may not be a good product for you. It does contain the supplements listed, which have helped my old knees. Since I've been taking Glucosamine Chondroitin, I can walk further without discomfort. I recommend the supplements, but not the form."
301282,0,At the very beginning I seen a much bigger effect then I do now... I like the product and will continue to use it but it seems to lose its umpf as time progresses... Still losing weight just not sure if the pill is helping out any to be honest...
77358,2,"Would be fine, if it was 4x louder. Will only mask very quiet sounds. Not useful for most situations."
93151,0,"This product helped me straight my back, but the problem is that is make my arm and hand numb because it has the presure on my nerve. Hopefully, they can make improvement."
305468,0,"Based on the reviews I read, I asked for this thermometer on my baby shower registry, hoping to be able to avoid using a rectal thermometer. I was delighted when a friend (who is a doctor, no less) purchased it for us. However, I'm been disappointed for several reasons. First, I haven't been able to get a consistent reading on anyone in our house. Perhaps it's because the thermometer is sensitive enough to register tenths of a degree, but no matter who I scan and how many times in a row I scan, the temperature always comes out at least one-tenth of a degree different. Now, that wouldn't be such a bad thing except that the effect seems to be cumulative, so after 5 scans in a row, I'm now half a degree away from where I started, etc. This really makes me doubt the overall effectiveness and accuracy of the thermometer, especially when my baby's temperature is close to a reading that's too high and needs to be brought to a doctor's attention. I asked my pediatrician about this thermometer, and she said it's okay for getting a general idea of my baby's temperature, but for times when I need a truly accurate reading, the only thing to use is a rectal thermometer. She also recommended using an under-the-arm thermometer to get a more accurate reading than on this one, and that's what I now find myself doing."
93626,1,"I ordered this for my husband and he said it is okay . It wasnt exactly what I was picturing when it came in . But it does what it is needed for , I am not sure if I would order it again ."
65870,0,"I hardly have bad reviews about anything I buy, but this stuff is garbage. It clumps like crazy! Sticks to cups, spoon, and sink. The nutrition stats are good on paper, except for the high cholestrol. I don't see how this product can have 9 good reviews, it must be skinny 18 year olds buying this stuff. They may not mind the clumpy and stickiness since mom would be washing the dishes for them.You absolutely need to put this in a blender, and even then you spend lots of time cleaning the blender.The taste is of the chocolate is good and not too sweet.I rather take multiple shakes of Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein Gold. Optimum Whey is awesome stuff. Very clean high protein. Not a weight gainer product, but blends amazingly with water.I can't get over how sticky this stuff it....it's like a cat on a curtain."
369401,2,"The friction created by pedaling the machine heats up the metal to a dangerous temperature--I have a second-degree burn on my foot to prove it. So make sure that you use it wearing shoes or socks, and keep it away from children. Or, better yet, don't by it at all. I wish I hadn't."
202884,1,"I have hemorrhoids and an anal fissure which act up from time to time. The moment I start to feel any symptom at all, I use this product mixed with Vit E cream and arnica. Not only does it work better than a steroid cream, but it is side effect free. Steroids can be so harmful."
305323,0,"I like the idea of this thermometer and will continue to use it, except it doesn't glide across the forehead like the one your doctor uses. The temperature can be recorded differently each time because it is affected by when you push the start button, whether or not you lift it off of the forehead, etc."
7274,1,"love it. works great. the head function is my favor. if it can hold more water, that will be perfect."
94046,0,"i bought these because of the enormous endorsement by my super health conscious (vegan) friend. when i got them i couldnt believe the funk! i have taken them and did not notice if they helped or not. i take them occasionally when not feeling well (but only at night). they give you the WORST breath and you can taste them for a while after swallowing. the after taste actually prevents me from taking them on a daily basis. too bad, because i would like to see what all the hype is about. smell is AWFUL."
40198,0,"I've been using the Rembrandt Whitening Toothpaste for five days now, and I do notice a slight whitening of my teeth. After I brush, my teeth feel very clean and fresh. Because I have sensitive teeth, I liked this product a lot -- it was very gentle. I'd recommend this product to my friends and family."
148470,2,"The brace felt very comfortable at first, and seemed like it was going to work for me. However, the thin gray strip of rubber/plastic that goes around the thumb broke within 3 hours of wear. I sent it back for a full refund."
228872,0,"If you've never had one of these, do yourself a favor and try one before you commit to an entire box. They're sweet, sticky, and really chewy, and they'll do a great job of giving you energy and killing your appetite. That may actually be a good thing, depending on the context.I don't eat these much lately, but there was a time when I was very busy at work, and I didn't want to take a half-hour for lunch and pay $7.00, and I didn't bring my lunch, but I had a box of these and it took only one to get me to totally forget about food for several hours. Power indeed."
253260,0,"This stuff works great for the very hairy man type like myself. I found ""maintenance"" very painful and time consuming when needed with a manual razor. Apply the product thickly, wait 20 minutes, and wipe off the product with a clean dry towel. The 8 to 15 minute mark doesn't work for me since my hair is really thick. I have no skin irritation with this product but my skin feels dry the day after use. The dry skin is nothing compared to razor burn, bumps, rash, & cuts I use to get with manual shaving. I've tried generic equivalents of this product at my local drug store. The generic works as well as the brand for 1/3 less in price. The only bad thing about this product and the generic equivalents is the funky smell that develops after its been on your body for a bit."
32504,0,"The table itself is everything it advertised; pretty, sturdy, comfortable and the heater works fine. I would have loved this product if I didn't hate the headrest and armrest so much. The headpiece was flimsy, hard to adjust, and worst of all, can't breath through that tiny opening. Armrest, totally useless."
173766,0,"I think electric shavers are a very personal thing: My father loves his Philips / Norelco shavers, unfortunately they never did much for me. And this one is no different.First, the product has been improved by making all three heads flex, which can give a smoother shave. Unfortunately this also means that you don't get a particularly close shave either! Second, the three shaving heads still can't get into those 'hard to reach areas', a problem I've always had when using this brand. Third, I don't think it's designed for people who have whiskers `off the face' (like on the neck) as the shaver always seem to pull these out, rather than shave them!In the end the difference is this: if you have a tough beard, particularly with little 'hard to reach areas' then don't go for this brand - I'd say go for a Braun! On the other hand, if you have a light beard then this would be a great shaver; it's certainly easy to clean (just rinse under water after each shave) and very light weight."
183608,0,I did not like the smell too much. It smells a little like coconut. I gave it to a friend and she liked it. Maybe it wasn't the right scent for me.
393747,0,"This brace is made of comfortable canvas material, but the metal bracing insert is shaped in a puzzling and uncomfortable way.It offers some level of support, but with the bad insert shape it's hard to recommend it because I've tried some other braces that while not necessarily being made of a material as comfortable as this brace have a more comfortable bracing shape to them."
408869,0,"I have been a Vitol 100% Egg Protein user for almost 30 years and find myself very disappointed in the new and ""un""improved flavor. The old formula was much better for mixing with fruit smoothies, milk shake/frozen cappuccino type drinks and oatmeal without adding any unwanted flavor. Most mornings I would load up my ""VitaMix"" up with pineapple,bananas,frozen starwberries,plain yogurt and Vitol's 100% Protein without any added sweetners and enjoyed it,,,,now I find myself searching for something better.The new formula mixes rather easily with a hand mixer with milk or water, tastes ""ok"", but is too sweet for me and also leaves sort of a bitter aftertaste. I have also recently compared this to Rose Acre Farms ""Dried Egg Whites"" and Healthy 'N Fit ""100% Egg Protein. I have to say I prefer Vitol over the other two brands but wish they would go back to the original formula."
125624,1,"Plug it in, charges, that's it. Not much to say but it works. I keep it on the default settings and it charges my double AA batteries in like 12 hours. Fine with me, since I'm in no rush."
212560,0,I've been using this shaver for quite some time now but it does not give me a close shave. Would not recommend this product for purchase if you are a black man looking for a clean close shave.
335185,0,Used this after waxing my legs. Wouldn't remove the leftover wax fully. I had to rub the wax off manually with my hands like you would a sticker stuck on a lighter.
181872,2,"I am not a professional here or have much medical knowledge. Just wanted to be careful before taking any new treatment. I've checked online some of the ingredients it has, and shockingly found out at least ""Nickel Sulfate"" it contains will lead serious liver damage. Just very superficial research, but wanted to warn you to be more careful."
316438,1,"We really liked this massage oil for massage, foreplay and lovemaking. We tried the coconut cream and the before dinner mint flavors and they both had a light, pleasant natural flavor and smelled yummy. There isn't a lot of crap in these oils, they're made with natural ingredients. Unfortunately had to leave these behind when I moved but I will be getting more soon."
427269,0,"These cups fit the bill perfectly for what they are, just the right size, comfortable in the hand and the grip feature helps smaller hands keep on it.Too bad that for the same amount of cups I can spend $24 (before tax) at my local walmart to purchase this many."
177049,0,I dilute the product quite a bit before using it.Jason's Mouthws does seem to be a good mouthwash however.
340008,0,"Hmmm, reviews were great. Was just OK, nothing special taste-wise. (perhaps the benefits?). For the money, texture & taste I highly prefer NUTS to be a top ingredient, & texture in a product called Nutz over Chocolate. Taste more like Rice Krispy bar, the kind made w/Karo Syrup, & a bit of chocolate. Also found this non-filling, or satisfying. IF you like that taste n' texture then you may like these. Back to my FAV standby that is filling & satisfying, a Sea Salt, Nuts & Choc Kind bar. If I eat one - stavs off the hunger. Where are the nuts in this? Ground up? If they were, would think it should be more filling, satisying. For me, my little 100 Calorie bag of Diamond Almonds Dark-choc are more satisfying & filling than this bar. Sorry - sounded good in theory & again IF you like the old RK bars made with Karo Syrup, then most likely you would enjoy these. Still they had a ho-hum flavor, needs the peanut butter layer added in order to taste just like them & at least wake up your taste-buds."
342378,0,It looks good and squeegees good but the suction cup holder falls off the wall in a couple of days so now the squeegee just lays on the shower floor.
87818,1,It worked as my friend said it would. Very good. Better than the prescription. And at a very low price. I was pleasantly surprised.
23773,0,The arch part of this does help if you have arch pain. The trouble is that it is a little bulky and won't fit in most shoes.
44150,0,"Whiile tthe product itself is very good and does the job, the brushes are WAY Over-Priced.How many many toothbrushes could you buy for the same price? Mucho many!"
259997,0,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way. I wish I'd just gone to my local CVS and got the Futuro to begin with because thats what I use now. I can't for the life of me find it online, but this blog has a photo of it. [...]"
248077,0,"This groomer works quite well overall. The blade does get clogged pretty quickly if you've gone awhile without trimming, but flip it over and shake it and the clog falls away. The foil will never trim as well as a blade, but that shortcoming is hardly limited to this device. It takes multiple passes over body hair to get everything trimmed, but it will get them all eventually. As far as a usable body groomer, this does a decent job.My complaint is I'm on my second in 18 months, and will likely be my last, as I'm on a search for a different device. The battery is garbage. I use a Norelco shaver for my face, and it's battery lasts years and years. Use it to full discharge, recharge full and you're ready for 3 more weeks. Not the Body Groom. It seems this battery is only good for a dozen charges or so before it can't last 5 minutes. Both Body Grooms I've had exhibit this exact behavior. Norelco does a great job with batteries in their shavers, why not in this? No idea, but I'm tired of reaching for it, turning it on, and having it die in 60 seconds."
135700,0,"Yeah, it falsely says that it will heat up which it doesn't but I just my own hot water and foot soak powder and I'm a happy camper! This particular model could stand to be a little cheaper seeing how a lot of other brands and models have different types of features. One thing I wish for this one is that it had a cordless option...it's a pain to find a place to sit down that's near an outlet."
395086,2,This brace was not for me. The canvas is not comfortable and the inside is not lined. I use mine for everyday wear and this was just not up to par.
383879,0,My husband (40s) has been taking this for a few weeks now. He hasn't noticed really any changes. Perhaps it is too subtle.
38383,0,"A good product overall, but didn't like the following things about the product:1> The charging chord is a little short than my previous Braun Epilator.2> The charger is a heavy one compared to the one from Braun.3> The charging chord connects at an uneasy place on the Epilator; this causes the handling of the epilator a little difficult especially if they are on the sensitive areas of the body. We wish the chord was connected like in other Epilators at the rear."
2981,0,"The price is good, but when I use it, I found it is not strong enough. It can break when use it."
277700,1,"This could have been one of my staple oils because it works well in my hair, but I think I may stick to hemp and coconut oil."
320914,0,I thought that since this was OXO it would be great but not so. Blade not flexible and not long enough. Also squeaks. Just not user friendly.
382692,1,"I bought this product because I had a dr. accuse me of being anxious and depressed. While I would agree I suffer from white coat anxiety, I didn't agree with the dr. otherwise. I figured, though, that if the dr was right, a biofeedback game would be the perfect help. I had wanted to try Journey, anyway, and this gave me an excellent excuse to buy it. I bought it for myself for Christmas. I have probably spent hundreds of dollars on meditation tapes, meditation books, classes - you name it, I've tried it. I do an excellent job of falling asleep using any of them. Journey to the Wild has been wonderful for me. I am finally experiencing the powerful benefits of meditation without falling asleep. I am given different experiences to entice me to keep trying, keep going - and stay awake. I am sustaining a feeling of happiness and life satisfaction. The only negative would be coming from my husband. He thinks I'm hogging the computer now. I've started timing myself so that I don't stay on too long. Who would have ever thought that a person who has found no computer games she liked previously would have to time herself so that she doesn't become so wrapped up she does nothing else? If you are looking for an adventure game, you won't like this. If you are looking for a meditation assistant, I think you'll love it."
297324,0,"The product was perfect in terms of quality and functionality, but sizing was wrong. I expect medium to fit a waistline of between 30-36, but this was way too small, and should have been labeled small. At least the vendor should have provided a sizing table on the web site if their sizing is non-conventional. Luckily someone else was able to use this support. It's a hassle to return and reorder."
129104,0,"I though this was great until one broke and left about 11 pills throughout my purse. If you are not transporting your pills with you throughout the day and leave the case at home, then this would be the case for you. It fits a good deal of pills. I can pack 4 large supplements and about 6 medium sized ones with no problems."
77772,0,"I was a little disappointed. A friend of mine has one of these; hers may be a different name brand. I borrowed hers two years ago for a cruise we went on, and I loved it; it had the true sound of a fan. This one seems to have a loud static sound that almost makes my head hurt. It's pretty loud. My husband likes silence to sleep, and I like a fan on med. or low; we're trying to find something that we both agree on so we can sleep in the same bed...this machine isn't going to work. This is my second sound machine I've tried; I'm starting to think nothing can replace a good ole fan."
79745,1,"This corded razor shaves reasonably well, but takes longer and more effort than my old Quadra. However, I abanoned the Quadra because the battery was wearing out and the blades cost almost as much as this whole razor.I like the corded feature because there is no battery to wear out over time. Of course, the razor is lighter than the Quadra because there is no battery, and it tends to make a bit of a shrill sound from time to time.Overall, though I like it and would likely buy another when this one wears out."
100905,0,I will rather buy some expensive over the ear trimmers. Like Peanuts or something else. Just OK for over the ear and earline trimming. Not cloese to skin trimming.
341042,2,"Its ok but definitely not worth buying because of the price.It does not do anything awesome to your face before shaving. Yes, smells good and a nice brand but not worth buying it because their may be better products available if you are ready to spend so much money.I will not buy it again."
267919,0,"I watch Dr. Oz, and he recommended to get cholesterol down, to use Benecol. I now use the ""butter"" which is GREAT, and decided to get the chews also.

They also say you need to eat 5 to get the benefit of a lower cholesterol."

If this changes, I'll update the review.The bad:* I believe the sterols content is about half what it should be.* I believe the pygeum bark is just filler.A Medscape page, which summarizes several studies, says, ""The recommended dosage of pygeum, on the basis of the clinical studies, is 100-200 mg of an extract standardized to a 14% content of sterols, including -sitosterol, usually given in two divided doses daily."" Later, it says, ""Dried pygeum bark is occasionally available. It is used in dosages of 5-20 g twice daily. However, the efficacy of the crude bark has not been studied, and the bark is not recommended."""

166677,0,"I had bought a store brand of this item from CVS, but I wanted to try this because it was a better price for the two-pack, and I assumed it would have the same fragrance as the store brand. I've decided that cassava flour-based pre-shave lotions are the best choice for me. For my beard, the alcohol in this stuff tightens up my skin, but once it dries, the cassava flour leaves my skin very smooth and the razor just glides right over my face. There's no doubt in my mind I'm getting a better, closer shave.The problem, however, is the fragrance. It's very spicy, with a heavy clove scent, and it lingers long after I have shaved. I can't tell if it's like Old Spice, but it's how I imagine Old Spice would smell. It's really overpowering.I'm going back to the CVS-branded pre-shave lotion. It works just as well, and smells far better in my (and my wife's) opinion."
291302,0,"... not so great toothpaste. I have been using Supersmile for a little over a year now, brushing twice a day, flossing, and rinsing as well. Within the first month of use, I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, and my mouth certainly felt clean; a year later, my teeth couldn't look any whiter without using professional whitening methods, but I still developed cavities.I showed the toothpaste to my dentist and he told me he was actually impressed with how white my teeth became just from a toothpaste. After reading the bottle though, he cautioned me to find a better toothpaste to use intermittently, particularly, Arm & Hammer's Complete Care toothpaste. As I said, despite religious use of the product, I still have cavities, and I don't eat much sugar.Supersmile does its job far better than many other whitening toothpastes. I haven't yet found a toothpaste that could get my teeth this white. Just use it with caution, it doesn't have the same cleaning properties that most other toothpastes do. My dentist suggested continued use of Supersmile, but to use it only every other time; Supersmile in the morning, Arm & Hammer at night. My teeth still look great, and they couldn't be healthier!"
78366,0,I purchased this in November and I have used it every night. I absolutely love the product but the device started sounding less loud recently. I though nothing of it and assumed it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Today I lifted the sound machine to dust and there was a pool of green acid below it. The batteries or something inside is corroding and/or corroded and is leaking through the foam. It also smells. Great. A fire hazard that lulls me to sleep. Nice.I really loved this product compared to other sound machines but I am nervous to buy another if the battery is going to melt into acid every 6 months. Not cool.
292446,0,The directions included are not as clear to understand as they could be about how to position the sphygmomanometer.

328815,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
71674,0,"hi, i brought this item when we were trying to conceive.. i do remember those days each month, waiting for the mark to turn positive. These strips are definitely cheaper and allowed me to not hesitate to test frequently. Finally, when my period actually got delayed by 4 days (and i later found out i was pregnant), this strip turned positive but, only indicates a faint positive line.. i repeated the test again the next morning, still showed a FAINT positive line. i guess, i would have been much more excited to see a darker positive line .. so i had to run to walgreens and buy a few different brands, just to come home and confirm that i Truly am positive and there is no doubt about my pregnancy !!"
8554,0,"I was disappointed with this because while it's well made as OXO products usually are, the bristles are soft. So if you have tea stains like I did in my water bottle it wouldn't remove those."
164058,0,"I bought the Diva Cup in November of 2010. I really wanted to love it. My sister in law in Italy (she bought a Moon Cup when she was home in England) raved about them. Everyone's been raving about them. I love the concept of zero waste and the hygiene aspect. I am prone to mind-numbing, intense, kill someone for a decent pain-killer cramps. I can't use this thing for too long without having worse than usual cramps. I've stood by tampons over the years, but even they cause cramps within 20 minutes of using them. I've tried it with every cycle since I bought it and about 60% of the time have to remove it and use a pad. I'm sure the cramp issue is my own personal health problem and no reflection on the cup itself, but, for women who get crampy from any pressure on her abdomen or tampons, use this with caution. Also (men, if you're reading this, look away) if you have a bowel movement, you will probably need to re-insert the cup.I will say that someone needs to design an inserter for women with small hands, because I just cant get it positioned right without a whole lot of contortion and effort. I've heard alot of women with this issue. Aside from all my rants about the product, it handles the heaviest flow with ease, I've only had one leak and that was user error, not the cup. The stem is a bit of a problem because I can feel it and I can't trim it off because I need it to remove the cup!In all sincerity though, if you're reading these reviews trying to decide for yourself about getting a cup or not, do. I don't regret it, I use mine as much as I can and if I didn't have such horrible cramps, I would use it 100% of the time. It really is a life changer once you master the insert (youtube is a Godsend on that topic, I use the ""punch-down"" fold) and it's great for the environment as well as your wallet."
80585,0,"I will cut to the point. After 3 months of regular use, It isn't a matter of material choice, but rather the design compared to expected use.1. All proper shower floors should slope to facilitate draining. If you are not directly over the drain with this 4 legged item, you will experience a slight rocking/tipping in one direction since the slope on opposite sides of the drain will be different. Just an annoyance since their is no way for the seat to compensate for minor variations. Perhaps a bigger/flexible plastic footing?2. A triangular shape on a square base. What idiot designed this. You cant fit this in the corner of anything. The expected corner leg will always protrude into the corner by a couple inches and the opposite leg will do the same. I can only speak for my own space problems in the shower, but my shower could use the extra inches.Positive: Its big and will easily support most people. No rust on the metal. No cracking of the plastics or wood. my wife uses this constantly. I've used it on occasion to just prop myself up under the shower for a long steam soak when I am experiencing the common head cold."

187910,0,"I just bought a case of these. Despite spending time measuring liquids to get a sense of how large the bowls would be and reading reviews of each size, I finally decided on the 12 oz size to use as cat bowls. When they arrived this week I was surprised at how small they seem, and deep. Cats, at least mine, don't like deep bowls, as their whiskers get messy. But using flat plates meant that half the food wound up on the floor. I needed a happy medium. I found them at CVS, where they don't advertise by ounces but by inches. The 7 inch bowls are larger and flatter, and my cats seem to like them. They are, of course, more expensive, so I will have to use the case of these first."

But by morning, Chillow has snuck off the pillow, curled over to reveal it's pool-toy esque plastic side, and stuck to my upper back and neck. Not only that, but it absorbs so much heat from me, that it feels more like a heating pad by morning. It is so warm that my boyfriend rolled over on it and thought it was a hot water bottle.

And I also realized that the Swiffer all in one are better for minor spills and light stains because there have been several occasions where I break sweats trying to remove stains from the ground. On the positive side, I truly had a 5 to 15 min workout with it, and finally it broke on me after a year using the product. I recently bought another one two weeks ago for immediate replacement. After I'm through with the wet jet, I sometimes feel that the floors should be shinny. However, it dries like right after 60 seconds. Let's just be honest, it's best to rely on the trusty old mop to get the job done follow by a floor glow/shine product."

418426,0,"""Sea Bond"" denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste, gel, or powder, the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist, I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case, the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this. However, dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, DDS"
98857,1,This was recommended for my dog for use during or before a thunder storm. Need to administer 4 drops on the tongue about an hour before and then again every 1 - 1 1/2 hours during the storm.

272744,0,We've had hit and miss experience with the product. When you get it to take the temperature correctly it is a degree or so too low. The other times you have to take the temperature multiple times to get the reading. Maybe with more practice we will get better at taking the temperature.

49975,0,"Lowest setting is too HOT for me. The large Sunbeam is also too hot for me.Reading through the dos and don't of this product makes you scared to even touch it. You are only allowed to lay it over you and even then one side must be exposed to open air.I seen a new Sunbeam today at walmart that has 6 heat settings, 30 bucks. I came on line to see what you all thought and can't find it so far....not even on Sunbeam's website, weird.I'm looking for a pad now I can program like the BodyMed ZZHP1427 14"" X 27"" Electrical Digital Moist Heating Pad (86 degrees to 166)[...]Unfortunately one reviewer says of the BodyMed ""the pad has several semi-flexible flat rods (kind of like the boning found in a bra or corset), like a ladder. The semi-flexible flat rods prevent the pad from completely conforming to your body."" Plus I bet would be very uncomfortable to lay on or lean up against, which is how I use heating pads.Sorry for all this bs but I was told by amazon ""Please write at least 20 words describing your experience with this item. Repeated words don't count."" I don't remember ever seeing that before."
227375,0,"This is the first footbath I have ever had. There are a lot of them on the market and I did not want to spend $100 on my first one. I found it a little to small for my feet, not the lenght of it, but the height. The water just barely covers the top of my foot, moreover the water got cold after a while, it is noisy and the bubbles were not that strong. However, if you consider the price and what you get it is not a bad product. I believe that ratio between product quality and price is among the best on the market."
254860,1,I've only had these pads for a few days but I love them because they are bigger and absorb well for my dogs leaving my floor dry. The quality is better than expected as well. I haven't washed them yet but I read the other reviews and sounds good.

275935,0,"We bought this for my husband and he does not like the taste and aftertaste of it. The product contains cayenne and it does have a noticeable pepper taste when we take the pills (I take them now since he does not like it). It does seem to help though, but I thought Breathe Right products did a better job. It is a long caplet style? kinda smooth, but not the gelatin capsules, I forget the name. Not as big as a ""horse pill"" like prenatal pills or potassium pills, but almost. The purple plastic bottle is cute though - not sure yet how re-usable it will be (i.e. how easy the label will be to remove) - if not, then the local plastic recyclers will be happy to have it, I'm sure. The teddy bear is cute too but it has ""Quiet Night bear"" embroidered on its' belly. I'm not sure that I will buy it again since it looked to me like I was paying more for the bear than for the product."
185595,0,The tablets are VERY large so if you have trouble swallowing pills think twice. I would compare size to 2000 or 2500 mg multi-vitamin. Uncertain if the extra size is due to filler/tablet binders. Packaging states the extra stuff aids absorption.No noticeable effects when taken on it's own but works great as a choline source when taking piracetam. If you can scoff them down it's a good product. Probably available at your local health store at similar price though.

112799,0,"I haven't bought one of these, and it's probably as good as it's described. However, as I was reading the description, I wondered why any woman would spend $20 for it when you probably already have the necessary items at home. What I've done is to put my pump in the elastic top of my knee-high stockings. And when I wanted to wear a long summer dress with casual sandals, I used an old pair of knee-highs. I cut off and saved the elastic part (the elastic tops of my knee-highs are at least 3"" long) from the lower portion (which I tossed), then put my pump in the same spot, inside the elastic. This is worth a try - even worth buying a pair at the drugstore if you don't normally wear them. And if you don't like it, THEN you can buy the ""Leg-Thing""!"
214289,0,"This thermometer is accurate in some temperature ranges, and not accurate in others. I base this on comparing it with three other thermometers, including another Taylor brand. It seems to be inaccurate between 60-80 degrees Farenheit, but accurate at 90-100. Also, I find it hard to read, since the increments have large marks between the numbers and small ones at the numbers. I would have liked the increment indicators to be the same length. I'll keep it, since the price was right, and it looks good. But readings are plus or minus three or four degrees, generally."
393107,0,"This tub seemed excellent for my preemie baby girl. The removable hammock really was a terrific and secure way to bathe her quickly and easily. My daughter HATED taking a bath until she was 6 mths old, so we usually had a struggle and the hammock gave me some After she outgrew the hammock, it was time to move on to a bath seat. This tub is strangely designed in my opinion. Not much room for baby to play and that &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; in the middle tends to get in the way. The tub has a positive side, but overall, I wouldnt waste the money."

297369,0,"This review follows 4 months of shaving almost exclusively with the 7885XL and 10 years of shaving with a Philips/Norelco 805RX. I decided to purchase the new shaver when my old Philips needed another battery replacement. I figured another 10 years of technology would have had some beneficial impact on electric shavers. I was both right and wrong.The good:This shaver gives me the best shave I have ever had with an electric shaver. I went from an exclusively blade shaver to electrics about 10 years ago. Since then I have probably spent $500 on a Panasonic, a Braun, two Remingtons and two Philips. I quickly discovered I like the skin on my face and gave all but the Philips away. The 7885XL gives a very good and comfortable shave. Stubble appears by early evening so its not a blade shave but its very good and much better than any shaver I have tried in the past.The shaver is quiet and has a comfortable feel in a dry hand while in use.The bad:I'll start out by saying I wish I had done my usual battery replacement and stayed with the 805RX. Unfortunately I threw it away.Battery life is a bit worst than the 805RX which gave me 45 minutes on a full charge versus 32 minutes which is the highest I've seen on this shaver. I followed Philips battery conditioning instructions scrupulously.The charger is a separate unit as opposed to being built-in as on the 805RX. With the larger profile of the 7885XL and 10 years of advancements in electronics packaging this is really dumb. Yet another electrical box to have to store or remember to bring along on trips.Cleaning the shaver is a pain if you use the convenience of water:You cannot close the head or the blades will still be wet in the morning giving you a truly uncomfortable shave. The cap that protects the head is designed in a manner that won't snap on when the head is open. So, a wet shaver that likes to roll away (more on this later) and needs to dry out with all those delicate little parts exposed to whatever may come their way. Also, we live in south Florida where its humid when the ac is off. I towel dry the head before I place it in a newly &quot;protected&quot; area in a drawer. There is no second shave if an evening requires it as it needs a full day to dry.If you're traveling, leave the 7885XL at home. Not only do you have to pack another device (the charger -- if you need more than 30 minutes of shaving) but if you pack it wet you shave with it wet. Or, you leave it wide open on a hotel room sink hoping the cleaning lady will not send it rolling onto the floor with its cutter head wide open.The shape and texture of the shaver is smooth and when wet can easily slip out of your hand. Mine has hit the tile floor twice so far.The shape of the 7885XL is rounded and must have been designed by the same group that designs those Black and Decker power tools that roll off any place you lay them (especially when you're up on a ladder). You have to be careful when you put it down or it may go tumbling into the sink/floor or whatever.The cutter head unit must be opened to clean it. The head is poorly secured to the shaver body and if you shake out the water before wiping it dry it will come flying off and those delicate blades will take a serious, if not fatale, bump on the countless hard surfaces bathrooms have.To get the best shave I've ever had takes time. My guess is the shaver will get an equivalent shave to the 805RX in an equivalent amount of time. However, to get the shave the 7885XL is capable of giving you have to keep shaving for another few minutes. Its worth the time but its about as long as a razor will take including prep and clean-up time.The materials for both the 7885XL and its packaging are noticeably below those of the 805RX. Given the price and the advancements in technology Philips must be making a fortune on this shaver.Overall:The 7885XL is a great cutting machine marred by too many design glitches. It screams designed by people who have never worked on an electric shaver, never used an electric shaver and never bothered testing what they designed. On the other hand, Philips did a great job on the cutter head.In summary, I would have done another battery/cutter head replacement on my old 805RX rather than purchase this shaver. While it gives a better shave, there are too many glitches to make the 7885XL a satisfying ownership experience. After 4 months of use I still can't live with the design elements of this product.Looking at this product and the many other models Philips currently offers I would suggest many of the limitations in the 7885XL are shared by other Philips shavers. This is unfortunate."

378566,0,This tub goes through 4 differnet stages for baby which is great. The sling that you use (before baby sits up) is bit of a pain because baby keeps sliding down and I have to keep bringing her back up to where she belongs. But it is very easy to bathe her using the sling especially when I wash her hair (soap and water doesn't get in her eyes and clean her bottom. Now that she is sitting up we are on the 3rd stage of the tub. So far it has been working out fine. It is just hard to keep the soap and water running down her face when I wash her hair. To that I would recommend to you to get one of those visors that you can put on babys head which will help this problem. I use it in our big tub and I have no problems with leaks. There are a few spots that make this tub hard a little hard to clean.

204120,0,"If you buy this, know that the sound WILL eventually cut out on you (I own 3 and it has happened to all of them). The culprit is the electrical connection made by the power/volume knob. At first, you might be able to get away with simply blowing into the space around that power/volume knob, but you'll eventually need to get a little more creative. Take a folded piece of paper (business card works well) and insert it into the gap around that knob to serve as a brace/collar between that knob and the casing. If you position it well, you'll see the power light steadily illuminated and the sound won't cut out.Note that I still rated this as a 3, because that workaround is very easy and the device still provides decent value at this low price point."

414836,0,"My Mom and Dad recommended these nasal strips, along with using the Breathe Right throat strips. Apparently, this combination has been the only thing that has made my dad's snoring more tolerable for my Mom. My Mom was clear that I should try the ""Extra,"" and not the weaker versions of the nasal strips.However, after having used them for several weeks, I can't say I've noticed any difference in myself. They did open my nasal passages more, it's true, but they didn't help me with my snoring or not getting a good night's sleep.I guess each user is different. They may be worth your trying them: they worked (with the nasal strips) for my Dad, but not for me. They're inexpensive enough that they're worth a shot for anyone who has a problem with snoring or sleep apnea."

96333,0,"I use the Barley daily. Super stuff!I've had one of these cups for quite some time which had been offered free as a trial from the manfucturer and have been looking to get more for some time now.I thought, it was offering four of the cups as a ""4 pack.""You get 4 small packs of barley and one cup.Excellent price on the 10 oz canister of Barley as well."
350953,0,"This product is sufficient for a standard-sized bathtub. There were no clear instructions for assembly but it was do-able with a little patience. The length of the legs is very easily adjusted and the rubber feet protect the tub very well. My bathtub, however, is very large and we had to place a couple of two-by-fours under the outer legs to compensate for the height. We also padded the edge of the tub with a folded bath towel to protect it from the aluminum tubing from rubbing against it. The width of the seat is also fine for a standard tub but when used with a larger tub with wide sides some of the width is lost. All in all, it worked fine for our temporary need but if purchasing a transfer bench for long-term use I would recommend something sturdier.When the product was delivered the package was in such terrible condition I did not open it. It was torn, scuffed, and looked as though it had been opened and re-taped about three times. I called the company and it was promptly replaced with an unopened package, at no expense to me."

273665,1,"I am posting this review mostly as a public service, to let prospective customers know just how enormous this product it.The maximum diameter (largest bulb) is 2.35 inches, with a total length of 5.65 inches.It's too big for me. I have barely managed to accommodate theTantus Severin Medium Anal Plug, which is 1.85 inches at its largest point. No one should even consider this large sized plug unless they can comfortably and reliably accommodate the medium one.The larger Tantus plugs are pricey, but they are of high quality. The ""platinum"" silicone material is mirror-smooth and easy to clean, which is a plus. Lubrication must always be used, and patience is needed -- especially with something this big. Insertion must never be forced -- it should never be painful. Something this big would definitely take some serious working-up-to."
161009,1,Great Product and service. This size is great for carry around or in your drawer at work.
253720,0,"these gloves are soft, satin-looking (tacky looking) and amount to some vibrating pieces (carbon plates) at the palm side tip of your (the last phalanx) fingers ... provided that your hand fits the glove UP to those carbon bars, which are about nearly 2"" long. Applying on your skull, those vibrating bars do their average fibrillating w/ moderate or insignificant pressure on your head. the overall feeling is that something vibrates (w/ dispersion a` la horizontale)at the surface on your hair but NO sturdy or strong sensation can be felt if you really need pressure at each tip such that the force be applied downward. Headache can be mostly fixed w/ pressure point being forced downward and these gloves seems to radiate horizontally, w/ moderate force overall in an unhelpful way. I am disappointed since you have to muscle yourself locally at each hand to direct the fingers (when vibrating w/ that carbon tip situated on the last phalanx of your - palm side - finger) downward on the skull, which is not in conjunction with the horizontal vibration of the carbon tips. I would not recommend this product as a genuine or significant asset to fixing or alleviating headaches."

Love it!I decided to try this flavor, too...and not so much with the love. The sweetener aftertaste is more noticeable in this flavor and the sweetness level is through the roof. Now, I'm a gal who loves sweet coffee and sweet treats (though I curtail them these days), but this was too sweet even for me. I have to dilute it a lot with almond milk.But, I still like the stats on it, and Jay Robb's whey products are part of my daily diet/fitness routine.I just wish he'd dial back on the sweeteners. :)"
259993,0,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way. I wish I'd just gone to my local CVS and got the Futuro to begin with because thats what I use now. I can't for the life of me find it online, but this blog has a photo of it. [...]"

388158,0,"This item is like the lumiscope units I have used for 25 years. The differences decreased the stars.I ordered it because lumiscope design changes made their units subpar. They did not measure BP accurately.This unit has a nylon cuff made of what I would call ""pool toy"" material, instead of the soft, cloth-lined sleeve with bladder in old lumiscopes. I don't think this is as good or will be as durable as the soft cuff. I have noticed more odd readings with this unit (sequential readings differing by more than 20%. Except for these aberrations, the new unit is accurate with systematic error less than 5% compared to my old lumiscope, which is calibrated. Variability is about the same as with successive readings using the lumiscope.Construction: The gauge seems its strongest point. The stethoscope attachment is okay but they could have added 2"" more tubing and used better quality tubing. The bulb works well, but the rubber seems stiff. The cuff works as well as my 15 year old lumiscope, but I don't think it will be durable.In brief, while this unit definitely works now, the construction seems rigid and brittle. I admit I could be wrong about this, but it brings to mind chinese knockoffs."

391833,0,"I purchased this callus shaver with vision of all the money I'd save by not getting pedicures at the salon, but I must say I am disappointed. I don't know if I have tougher or thicker calluses than other people, but I have not had the best of results with this product. At the salon, I see strings of dead skin come off of their callus tools, but this product barely creates any, and then, only with more pressure from me than I feel really comfortable about. Another thing: do not leave this item in the shower! The blades are extremely prone to rusting- one or two days left there will render the blade totally unusable!On a positive note, the rasp is useful and the design is pretty good. I purchased a bunch of replacement blades from my local Beauty Brands (though they are also available here on Amazon) and I am hoping that will make a difference in how this product performs."

A back-light would make this readable in any situation. Secondly, I wish there were a way to turn off the beeping.I love the product, but it needs the back-light improvement."
328752,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
250307,0,"I want to make it clear I have not tried this so you can take or leave my review. I just wondered how effective this possibly could be when it only has 1mg of Chlorophyll. It has 4mg of peppermint. So I am assuming the only thing that works is the mint. There are a lot of other products that have 50, 60 or more mg of Chlorophyll which is the better active ing. that even this same company sells so don't think I am trying to be a smart ellic. I'm not, just sometimes even I overlook minor details when purchasing like how many oz something is and I get it home and think it's so much smaller than it looked online. Just click on the enlarge pic under the product and be aware of how much of what is in it. Still giving it 3 stars b/c I don't feel I have the right to give less until I try it."
360290,0,"Packaging of them- the tins they come in- are very high quality- they look cool too. As for flavor...first let it be known that these are NOT Altoids or anything like that, they are not strong and they are not meant to be strong, neither are they breath mints (although the site calls them that). Now, the reason my review is only 3 stars is because the first time i had these mints they were awesome- really smooth texture and unique flavor (i got some free samples) but the ones i bought here do NOT taste the same (they are the same brand and flavor...there is no mistaking it)so maybe i got a funky batch? i dunno....these just arent the same as the samples i tried"
273591,0,"I should have known when it said, mini I could possibly have problems with these. But, the truth is I still use them for opening little things around the house, although they aren't very sharp at all. I will probably keep these just in case I have a another flare up."

The plunger is SOOOO STIFF, you basically can't use it for anything other than all the way out or all the way in. It really doesn't slide so well. I try to slide the plunger to the exact volume I want to fill it (so baby doesn't swallow a lot of air) but it's really tough to hit that mark. The way you open it (hinged opening)doesn't feel secure or snapped-in, and last night, trying to ensure it was fully closed, I instinctually squeezed it- pushing the plunger in and shooting gripe water everywhere. Then the little guy didn't need it, so I put it in a ziploc in the fridge- and it all leaked out. (I thought it was paci-up, but who knows!) Sigh. It's a real bother. Perhaps it'll be of use if I ever have to give cough syrup or something like that, but I've given up with the gripe water."
162795,0,"After reading such great reviews for this product, I was very excited and hopeful upon purchasing it. I really wanted it to work. I used it as recommended for about a week and did not notice any difference. Since then, I have to admit that I've been forgetting to take it. I'm going to start taking it again--maybe it just needs more time to kick in. As of right now though, I have not received the benefits that many others have. Hopefully, after a second try it will be effective."
394938,0,"Its a good product, does the job, shaves my legs, duh. Razors in general are expensive so I can't criticize this product in particular, but man I hate buying razors.

23414,0,"I was hoping I would like this, but I am not sure yet. I thought when I initially used it, it worked ok, but the more I used it I realized I couldn't hear with it as well as I would like. I find myself going back to my old 1. The head (heart) is large and it is sort of hard to get it in the right place on small arms. I also notice that when I am holding it to listen to a BP that there is a lot of noise (which is from me holding it in place)"
39710,1,The cost of this product is almost 60% less than any store around and I would recommend this product to all. It is money well spent on a great product I am very satisfied with the product

148964,1,"This absolutely does work since the active ingredient, potassium nitrate, is exactly what is in Sensodyne, and is the proven effective and well accepted compound to use for the condition of sensitivity due to loss of tooth enamel. Many skeptics of natural products fear they won't be strong enough to be effective, which just isn't true for most things, but this actually has the same effectiveness. Sensodyne, like every other non all-natural toothpaste, is full of harmful synthetic chemicals. All those other inactive ingredients are irrelevant when it comes to sensitivity and are mainly there to make the paste foam, sickeningly sweet, and dyed. The only other paste for sensitivity I know of that uses a different ingredient is a version of Sensodyne available in Canada that has strontium chloride instead (although Canada also has the one with potassium nitrate too). Potassium nitrate works by crystallizing with minerals present in saliva and filling in the pores in the tooth, causing the pain signal to the nerve to be interrupted. Remember though, nothing can replace lost tooth enamel so if one's condition is severe they may not get as much relief. There can also be other factors going on like inflammation of the gums or nerve roots that need to be addressed. Clenching and/or grinding teeth at night, brushing too hard with bristles too coarse, and eating/drinking acidic foods cause this condition and make it much worse if continued. It takes many weeks to feel results as the pores are getting filled. I am thrilled that they make this as I am so adamantly against scrubbing carcinogens into my oral mucosa that I refused to treat my sensitive teeth before I found this so I could continue using natural toothpastes. It tastes great and the wintergreen is refreshing."
413918,0,"I didn't see the range of pH the strips tested and this product stops at 7.50, which isn't exactly what I wanted. Still, these are pretty good and the packaging is very nice. It really depends on what you will be using the strips for if this range will work for you."
357906,1,"Best clipper I've ever used, and I've been cutting my own hair now for about 30 years; the Oster is very quiet, keen, and finely tuned. I will probably be able to use it for the next 30-40 years, God willing. It was also considerable cheaper online than in retail outlets."
361613,0,"The first time I tried a bar I found that it tasted like a chalky, dry peanut butter cup. They kind of grew on me after that but the recommended glass of water is mandatory! Calorie and fat wise they are too high for me to eat regularly. They also have no fiber at all. Compared to other similar bars, they aren't as tasty as some and really stick in your throat. If you're a major peanut butter fan you might like them."
377837,0,"My favorite things in this kit are the comb and the nail clippers. My daughter actually sits contently while we use them to cut her fingernails. They are very sharp and the perfect size, and the bulb shape fits comfortably in our hands and helps us to stabilize the clippers. I use the comb every day to smooth out her bedhead, and she really enjoys getting her hair combed. She even tries to use it on herself. The bristle brush is worthless on fine baby hair though. It just glides over the top of her hair, so I never use it. And I've never used the toothbrush because it looks too big. I just use the nubby rubber brushes that slide over my finger. I've used the scissors a couple of times to trim my daughter's bangs, and I feel they are a little dull. But all in all, I am very glad we have this kit."
310158,0,"I was looking for an energy bar with more protein than the regular Clifbar varieties.It came down to the Clif Builders bar and this one.This bar is very similar in texture to a Powerbar, which is to say it has that weird, glossy-oily uniform texture throughout with no layering or chocolate coating like the Clif Builder.The flavor is okay, not great. And certainly NOT anywhere near a ""gourmet dessert"" as quoted by Dr. Phil on the packaging.I really don't now how anyone could come up with that statement other than having a lucrative endorsement deal.Speaking of quotes, I'd really like to know how this came out ""#1 in taste tests"". #1 compared to what?On the other hand, that weird texture and lack of chocolate coating would make these ideal in high temperature situations where the Clif Builder would certainly become quite a messy undertaking. You could carry around some Hooah bars in your pants pocket without worry. If that's your application, maybe these would work for you.In terms of value, since my application is occasional meal replacement I'd much rather spend a little more and have a Clif Builder to look forward to than a Hooah bar.In my opinion the Clif Builder is by far the best tasting, best textured bar of it's type and has the most protein.It's more expensive but it really does taste great. Just don't keep them in your pocket!"

30776,0,"This is NOT a 9V battery. This is a 9V SIZE battery, but even at full charge only supplies a maximum of 7.2 volts. The reason for this is that NiMH cells provide a lower voltage than do alkaline cells, so you can't get exactly 9V BUT if Energizer had added 1 more cell, they could have gotten 8.4 volts which is very close. For some reason (most likely monetary) they decided to cut us out on 1.2 volts (I feel cheated as a customer--minus 1 star). In most cases, this isn't a problem (thus a rating higher than 1 or 2 stars) since devices that use batteries are made to work under a variety of voltages since batteries lose some voltage as they discharge BUT if you are running a sensitive device that turns off at a threshold at or above 7.2V, then these won't work for you (minus 1 star). Other brands offer 8.4 Volt 9V sized NiMH batteries. I suggest you go with one of those."

68414,0,"I requested a free sample of Resveratrol Ultra (which turned out to be an unannounced $88 monthly auto ship that I had to fight to get stopped). Taking 2 capsules I definitely had more energy. After 8 days I also had relentless leg and foot cramps, which I initially blamed on my aerobics class. Then I had 4 days of severe abdominal cramping (like I should be running to the bathroom, but diarrhea was not part of the problem). Then a friend noted ""Didn't all this start about a week after you started taking that new wine-pill stuff?"" So, I cut the dose to 1 daily & the intensity of cramping lessened significantly. Then I decreased to taking 1 every 3 days. No more cramping. I am still taking half a capsule (I open it and sprinkle on scrambled egg bite...not a noticable taste) and I feel I have the energy boost, without feeling hyper and certainly without the cramps. I purchased these presumably lower-intensity Resveratrol from Amazon/Now Foods, hoping they will be just about right in the dose. I am writing the review on the Resveratrol Ultra because I want to warn others that the product can cause some interesting side-effects...and rather than wasting time wondering if you are having mini-strokes or developing some fringe neurological disease, you should probably cut or eliminate your use of Resveratrol."

133231,1,I have had this product for 2 months & last week at my dental cleaning they asked me what I was doing different as my gums didn't bleed and I had way less tarter build up. I use this product every night and the price was great with no sales tax and no shipping costs.
254967,0,I purchased a foam memorey cushion in the past and wanted to try this one as i felt the reviews were great.No one told me I had to have a degree in phisio-therepy to have it good to useI haven't used it yet as I've asked some friends for help and am waiting for their visit
186228,0,"With the reviews I read for this product I thought this might help me. I have a problem with post nasal drip...it's not just post nasal drip, my lungs get heavy, too.My neighbors smoke all through out the night when I'm trying to sleep. When they smoke, fumes come into my home and I get a reaction to the second hand smoke, I found something to help with the post nasal drip but my lungs still have a harder time inhaling and that always wakes me up feeling like I'm gasping for air.The funny thing is that I smoke, too so I have no idea why second hand smoke bothers me when I'm sleeping.So, I thought I'd try this to see if it helps. I've only been taking 2 a day and I think you're supposed to take 2 every 4 hours. But with just the 2 every 24 hours, it's not helping much.I'm going to try to take it every 4 hours to see if it helps, I'll update this review either way it turns out. Wish me luck. :D"
250766,0,"I have been using these heads for about a year now and I have to say they dont brush as well as the normal brush heads, I recently switched to the Original Precision brush heads and I get mush better results. I feel the Floss action is a waste of money, just a way to get a little more out your pocket to brush less."
207779,0,"I purchased this as a gift. It arrived fine. Because it's a gift, I have no opinion on it's actual quality, however, the supplier was prompt and it arrived in excellent condition."
202060,0,"This is the best lip balm ever made. It is non-greasy, has no flavor, keeps lips moist for hours and gives a great shine that even seems to enhance the color of lips. But the tube is the worst design ever. The tip is not an applicator tip so you either have to use your finger (gross) or rub the rough end over your lips. After you use about half of the tube it becomes a struggle to get any out, like a toothpaste tube. When you're down to 25% left you smoosh it to the top of the tube, trying to get out enough to put on your lips. After struggling for a while to get some out it all comes spewing out the top, all over your hands, wasting about 50 cents worth of product each time. It's so frustrating that I buy 2-3 different lip balms a month just trying to find one that works as well but is in a different container.Please Kiehl's you have got to make a better container for this awesome product."
333109,2,I used this product for 2 months and took the max dose. No difference in belly size or weight. My eating was the same as was my exercise program. Save your money and stay away from this useless product or the only thing you will lose is your money

85634,0,"I liked that these vitamins are designed with women in mind and come prepackaged in daily packets. That way, there's only one box of vitamins instead of several. The only problem I had was that when I took the entire packet (with a meal), I became nauseous. I remedied that problem by dividing the packet and took them with lunch and dinner. I'd recommend these vitamins to a friend."
65646,0,Good for keeping foot and ankle immobile; walking was easier than I thought it would be. Easy to take apart and clean. Velcro closures kept loosening; clumsy for going up and down stairs; hot for summer use.
214121,0,been using this product for 10 years but they have now changed it and way to sweet so don't use it anymore.
14527,1,My doctor recommended this product for cracked heels. It works great and I got a good price on it at Amazon.
426009,0,it work okay but my congestion was so bad i still needed prescription. so the product didn't work g=for me
415239,0,"performance of the shaver is very good. three major annoyances: (1) you can't plug the shaver in without the base, which means you gotta carry around the base and cord with you everywhere. bulkiness makes this a pain. (2) the trimmer works extremely well, but it's annoying that you need to switch the trimmer head with the regular head (and carry it around separately as well). (3) The hair falls out of the compartment while you shave, so you end up covered in hair. Which is fine if you're shaving before showering, but kind of gross when you have your clothes on."
73174,0,"This product worked great when initially purchased, however after about a month of use, it has lost its support and is very mushy. Would not buy again."
380775,2,"I thought this would be good for daily use when I don't need my steam mop (which I love), but I was wrong. The location of the button is right at the curve of the handle where you would rest your hand or pick up the swiffer and has lead me to ""swiffer"" my pants, the wall, the side of the fridge, ect. The solution also leave the floor sticky and I don't dare put any pressure on the handle to use the scrubbing pad in the front for fear of the handle snapping (I have also hit the butten then to ""swiffering"" my shoes). It was a waste of money and lesson learned."
167534,0,"I ordered these to use in a new pair of pumps with a 4.5in heel because they were really hurting my toes. I could feel a difference using these inserts, but definitely not enough to make the shoes comfortable. I am not sure if it is because this product doesn't really work, or because the shoes are just really uncomfortable."
295235,0,"I had this for about a year and it finaly broke. One of the troubling things I discovered was that after a while it started to build up mold or alge inside the tank. I discovered this when the pick-up tube fell off and I had to take it apart to re-attach it. I was fairly grossed out at this black ooze but I cleaned it well and put it back together.Be aware that taking it apart is not something you can do often as I broke it the next time I tried to clean it. I am however buying another of this same one as it is, sad to say, the only good one on the market. All the other brands are about as cheap and shoddy as they can get"
194866,0,"Pros: Heavy duty constructionCons: Very difficult to obtain a tight fit - especially in the heavier models. This means the slippery vinyl sides back and forth on your limbs as you use them.Fix: A steel loop strap would provide for a tight initial fit, which would then be secured by the existing Velcro.Conundrum: If you need HEAVY weights such as these, you likely won't find any alternatives. I couldn't."
269140,0,"The mask is great. It's soft, comfortable, blocks out all the light and smells good. If only there were a better way to hold it against my face.The strap is nearly an inch wide, has harsh edges and is badly placed. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's as if this mask was made for people without any ears. If you put the strap above your ears, the edge of the strap will cut uncomfortably behind them. Putting it over your ears just feels weird. My own solution is to adjust the strap quite tight and set it so that the Velcro clasp sits over the back of my neck. Even that is not truly comfortable, but it's the best solution I've found.Three stars because this mask does help me more than the ones provided by airlines or purchasable at drugstores."
69943,0,"I use the One Touch Ultra, on my arm, and find it quite accurate, much less painful then poking my fingers, and very quick - about 5 seconds. I have recommended this to two younger diabetics, one was five, the other seven. They and their parents were suprised that the readings were so comparable to the finger stick kind. The were both informed, by different doctors in different towns, that the arm pokers were not as accurate! I am currently shopping for test strips, now that my latest insurance at work was canceled due to high premium costs (60% increases over 3 years!) I have found, so far, prices pretty consistently around $69.98 plus shipping. Shipping varies from $7.00 to Free."
63627,0,"I bought assuming they were all lubricated. The blue ones are not lubricated as written on its label. However, it is not written in the description of this product."
346712,0,"This book was full of info, but most of it was the spiritual benifites from fasting. I wanted more of the physical benifits. But, if that's what you're looking for then this book is for you."
348255,0,Product is excellent except my husband can no longer drink it because the product is made in a facility with shellfish derivatives and he is allergic to shellfish. The product has caused him his allergy. Now the bottle is of no use to him.
79906,0,"After reading the reviews I thought sure this was like the old Norelco shavers. It was not. The shave was average at best, not as comfortable as the old 850RX, and took longer. It was quiet, not as quiet as their more expensive 8140 model, but ok.Guess more was expected due to the mostly positive reviews.It seems shavers are more a personal preference than one being better than another. Oh well."
343173,0,"I was searching Google for a paste to help heal bleeding gums and i found this. It is a bit helpful i believe, so i would say it is worth trying once. I cannot comment if it helping saving enamel though :)"
99330,0,"This book has good pictures and demonstrates a lot of taping methods for many parts of the body. It is very simple to follow and easy to read. It is not a good reference for therapists. It does not explain which muscles are being taped and does not describe I to O and O to I methods for each taping situation. You can determine what muscles they are taping by the pictures, but it is not very detailed. It also indicates taping by pain with movement and not necessarily what is the underlying pain source. Excellent book for picture reference or for just getting started. If you have some experience with taping and knowledge of anatomy this book will not be of assistance."
227441,0,It does provide a good foot bath and keeps the water hot (you must start with hot water). My disappointment is the noise level. It is loud which tends to distract from the relaxation aspect.
357459,1,"I knew this was the multivitamin when I went vegetarian 10 years ago and for the first year only ate grilled cheese sandwiches and mac and cheese and had no blood level issues :)It is easily digestible, 100% vegetarian and organic and can be taken on an empty stomach.Amazing stuff!"
289059,0,"This electric razor is okay-- very good on delicate underarms, but does not give a close shave on legs. It's great for last minute touch-ups on your way to work or whatever. But please, do not go by the GLOWING review that is posted twice on this site--it is very clearly written by an employee of the manufacturer (note all the specific details, like the person is reciting lines from the manual!)."
388477,0,"I think I lost about 5 lbs in the 15 days that I used this cleanse. It was helpful in eliminating excess waste and not harsh to my system. When taken in conjunction with a reasonable diet and some exercise, I think it does assist in reduce bloating and accelerate weight loss."
255659,0,"I bought this product to help me track my fat loss. That being said it often gives inconsistent readings. In a span of 2 minutes it would range +/- .6% from previous readings. I will take 4-5 readings and average them, using the average as final calculation.I know this isn't the best way to test BF%, but I was hoping it to be more consistent."
345091,0,I don't know if its just me or there are more people out there but upon taking this I broke out in a rash mostly my hands and feet also swelling big time it took a week to subside. Scary because I don't know of anything besides dust and mold that I'm allergic too. If you order this product I wouldn't recommend any more than one pill to see how you react. As with all supplements take the minimum first before upping dosage.I give it an average score because this might not happen to everyone.
67563,0,"My experience trying the chocolate flavored Balance Bars was one I don't care to repeat! I followed the instructions on the package to drink a glass of water with the bar and the water was the only way I could swallow it! The taste of the bar was very chalky and dry and truthfully, the thing almost made me gag! In all fairness to the product, it did keep its promise to satisfy my hunger and sustain my energy, but unless they can find a way to improve the flavor, I'll never touch another one! If you can stomach the taste and texture, than it may work for you, but I don't recommend this particular flavor of Balance Bars. Perhaps another flavor would be better."
69198,2,"I gave up after waiting a month to receive product, long after expected receive date. I wouldn't have ordered it if was listed as 'backordered'. Poor communication by mfg."
407968,0,Im not sure if this has really helped much. I still get hot flashes. Maybe not as intense. I usually take 1-2 daily.
164365,0,"I am only giving this review 3 stars because I have no problem with the company that sent this to me whatsoever. The product arrived on time and I had no complications with them. If I were basing this just on the product I would have put less than 3 stars.As for the actual product, when I looked at it, it was kind of a mild beige color, not white, but I said ok, I guess thats the natural color. I tasted it and it was one of the weirdest sweeeteners I ever tasted. I thought it would actually be better if I tried it in something, so I put it in some tea and ended up throwing the whole cup of tea away.I have had Stevia before and stevia beverages, the few I have seen were clear white and didn't have this weird taste. I have even had beverages where the Stevia had flavorings added and still remained white. It's not an aftertaste either, it's the actual taste of this thing. For those that think this is what Stevia is like, please don't give up on stevia, they are not all like this.***********************************************************************After thinking about what I said, I am adding these further comments to the review. Maybe my review was a bit too harsh. I realized that this product may taste like this because it is unrefined and the other stevia products I have had before are refined. Kind of like refined and unrefined sugar, therefore I decided to be fair and add this update."
293095,0,"We bought this cane to try to replace the type we usually buy. The lack of a grip is an issue and we will not purchase this cane again. The grips on the style we usually buy have been falling apart and turning ""sticky"" so we thought it would be worth trying one without a grip. While it is a personal preference, the lack of grip is hard to get used to."
218127,0,"Item came on time. Looked like box had been opener and resealed before shipping. Bars weren't that fresh and taste was ok. Hadn't tried that flavor, before but worth a shot."
380966,0,"Whoa, that perfumy smell really stinks. And having just mopped with a mop and bucket last week, I can tell you that the swiffer did NOT do a better job, it did a worse job. Even with more elbow grease than I had to use with the mop.But -- it is nice not to have to haul a bucket around. I think I will use my own cleaning solution."
253454,0,This is a flimsy heating pad and not very big. I think of king size to be a lot bigger and I am not a large person. It is not that soft and not very flexible. I am returning it.
274110,0,Product was delivered on time. It works pretty good to reduce the tendinitic pain I was getting from playing raquette ball. It is a little hard to adjust but it seems to be doing the trick.
208035,2,"I bought this at the recommendation of my doctor, and tried them for months. They did not help at all, and in fact, they made the balls of my feet hurt in addition to the rest of the discomfort. I went to a rigid boot for sleeping and that helped much more. Did not cure me, mind you, but provided a lot better relief than this stupid sock. I gave it away as soon as my boot showed up. I would not recommend this product."
370491,0,"I couldn't resist this little cutie. When I got it in the mail, I immediately froze the gel pack so I could use it that night. When it was finally frozen, I had a heck of a time getting the gel pack back into the bear. The openning is just too small. Once I wrestled it in, I placed the bear on my knee. It just doesn't feel cold enough. The fur that feels so nice is a barrier to the cold. Kind of sorry that I spent the money on it."

120251,0,"I ordered the gray pillow to blend with my gray office chair. In the product picture for gray, the fabric looked thick and that it would look inconspicuous in my office. The pillow is actually a light gray. The material looks more like the material for the black and burgundy pillow. Just something to think about if you are choosing the gray color. I also found that the pillow did not fit my office chair which was purchased from a big box office supply store. I used this pillow for 2 weeks but am done with it. It doesn't help my back at all."
272335,0,"I bought this product for my arthritic hands. I idea is great - I didn't want the product to cover my fingers as I was applying it so the roll-on fit the bill. The problem I experienced was that not always does the product flow from the roll-on head as I'm applying it. Sometimes shaking the bottle helps, sometimes not. Increasing the pressure on the head while applying doen't help. Hit or miss whether the product flows out so it can be quite frustrating. When it does, it feels cool and helps the pain a bit. Don't think I'd buy it again."
112825,0,These do not have as strong a grip as an earlier model that she had lost. It looks identical but she has a much harder time picking things up with it.
113331,0,"I used the latest Braun (Pulsonic 9595) for 3 months and have been a Braun fan for 10 years. After using the Norelco arcitec 1090 for 2 months I can say it gives me a closer shave than the Braun, both in light touch-up and heavy-pressure use. The Norelco is more fun to use and less expensive to clean. Just run it in a small cup of alcohol every other week, and touchup with glycerin."
381050,0,"I wanted to love these probiotics. I really did. I started taking these to get the ""good"" bacteria built back up in my gut after having a rough double round of antibiotics to treat H. Pylori. I can't say that these are a bad product but they honestly have given me the WORST cramping in my stomach. I would take one and about and hour later I am literally miserable from gnawing cramps in my stomach. Not fun. I made sure it was from these by not taking them and then trying them again. Every time I take them...doubled up in pain. I can't get myself to finish the bottle despite people telling me that these have an adjustment period for the body to assimilate to the good bacteria working into your gut. I just can't.Garden Of Life makes amazing products though. My discomfort and pain is merely MY body's reaction to the good bacteria in this and others I know have had NO reactions whatsoever. I have a couple friends who literally swear by this product and have never had as much as a gas pain from taking it. Just goes to show how we are all each so different internally as well as externally!I'm hoping to find something a little more gentle that will agree with my system better. The search continues!"
139233,0,"Dramatic results with this stuff. I immediately felt my appetite for snacking went away. I actually made it through the day without snacking at all. I didn't even think about food which is totally amazing to anyone who knows my eating habits. I didn't skip any meals and it was easier to control my meal portions. Everyone says my face looks thinner already although my body is still chunky. I know it takes exercise but I have yet to motivate myself. I want to lose a few pounds first so I'm not one of the ""bigger gals"" at the gym."

140986,1,"As more and more stores get conglomerated, and product choices diminish, it is great to be able to reach out to Amazon and grab a long-time favorite. We have used for years as an alternative to table salt. Not a salt substitute, not fake or phony, yet better if you do not want too much salt in your diet. By adding great vegetable taste through natural foods, it lowers the amount of salt that a normal dose would deliver. I have recently seen scientific results showing that salt phobia is non-sense, not a health risk at all. Still, this tastes better and I would use it even if it did not reduce over salinization."

416567,0,"The song choices for these are total crap and you have to push hard when you're brushing to hear the music. Also, where the button is located makes it easy for the kid to accidentally squeeze the button and turn it off. All I hear is complaints about this from the kids, totally not worth the money."
114612,1,"Excellent value. It's my third 1775 shaver (the first one was stolen and the screen wore out on the second). I use it to shave in the shower and never had a problem under these ""extreme"" wet conditions.My only grip is the components cost more than a whole new shaver. As a guy who dislikes waste, I found it was cheaper to buy a whole new shaver than replace the shaver head. Kind of like throwing away a whole ink jet printer because new units with ink are less than having to buy the ink cartridges! Bottom line, you'll love the shaver and won't find a better value.t"

350436,0,"Bought this product a few years ago. Best re-usable heat pack on the market. Bought a new one and yup, you guessed it, just not as good. They don't pack it with as much ""guts"" so it doesn't retain heat as well and you have to heat it up longer. Too bad, I used to really love it...."

103362,0,These cookies are moist and are an excellent source of protein but they are not my favorite flavor. Too much chocolate taste and it is not that good a chocolate taste. I prefer the regular chocolate chip cookies.
242733,0,Great concept and helped eliminate some of the sheet washing. Wish it were a little bigger. Our 5.5 year old moves around so much that sometimes he leaks beyond the pad. We've actually gone back to pull-ups for a while but still use the pad to prevent any leaks.
409836,0,these vitamins do work but like the earlier reviews state its very important to take them on a full stomach.I had read these reviews and was aware and always ate before but once i made the mistake of taking one before breakfast and i very much regeted it. within 5 minutes i became so nauseous i thought i was going to throw up right there on the spot.I quickly ate and it receded. Even if its a small meal i still get sick and usually it lasts for about 5 minutes and goes away so its not too angonizing but for me i must be full to be comfortable but other then that they do work.
77282,0,I enjoy the sound but my complaint is that it is not loud enough to cover up my mate's snoring. I have to use this in addition to another noise maker on the computer in order to get some peaceful sleep. I don't know how it could possibly cover up construction work down the street like another reviewer mentioned. I like the quality of the machine and think it will last a long time. It is good if you don't have too much noise you are trying to cover up. It would be nice if they could come out with a newer version that has a volume control.
22414,0,"Well, for the price, you would think that they would atleast stick. There is no adhesive in these. Nothing like a bandaid. I have to use medical tape as soon as I put them on. I read that you have to wash them daily? Kinda weird. I do, but it doesn't help with them sticking. I don't know if they are helping my scar or not, it hasn't been very long. But I'm very dissappointed that I have to use medical tape, cause now I can't wear them during the day without looking like I have a war wound. I was expecting to just put it on like a bandaid and go about my business..there is more up-keep then I had hoped for."
290865,2,"I cannot and will not ever take these supplements. Just opening the cap off of the bottle made me gag and nearly throw up. They reak so bad of rotten fish that I threw them out. Such a shame, since Spirulina has such great benefits. Wish I had known that before I bought them :( Oh well."
343955,0,"While this belt does work and stayed in place, it irritated my skin severely after wearing for about half a day with normal activity.

196894,0,"They do work, but dry out rather quickly.However ... If you clean something, glasses, screen on your iPod, etc. and then take that item on an airplane, perhaps through Denver International, and get the sniffer screening, you will test positive for explosives. This can be annoying. B&L; was not overly responsive to my comments on this.So, don't clean anything that you plan to fly with for at least 24 hours."
163729,0,I LOVE the concept. My one and only complaint; I wish this came with a longer stem for those who need it and those who don't can trim it. It goes to the age old adage that you can take more off but can't add more to it.
284614,0,"We've owned the device for about two months now. While it does provide some relief, I'm not certain I'd rate it as high as some. I think I need more time to make a fair evaluation.

18621,2,"I ordered the bridge threaders and the description read 10 per pack, 10 envelopes so I ordered a quantity of six expecting to receive a quantity of 600. Instead I received a quantity of 60. When I contacted the company they explained that there was an error in the description and I could return them for a full refund. Why couldn't they just send what I expected when I ordered. Plus they charged $4.95 for shipping an envelope that was delivered first class mail. I will not be ordering these again."
410903,0,"It appears to work, however, there is no product information (i.e. part numbers) or U/L certification. Even cell phone chargers I have bought that say made in China have part numbers and U/L certification. I was concerned that it would stop working or cause an electrical problem further down the line so I am returning it. Fortunately the seller has a 100% satisfaction guarantee so I'm only out shipping costs.FYI, there are really Sonicare Elite chargers out there; you just have to look harder."
184185,0,"Pros- Frequent use of salt water gargles is immensely beneficial to health. It's not some new-age, holistic mumbo jumbo, but a well established scientific fact. For example, salt water rinse promotes the healing of gum tissues following dental/oral procedures, and salt water gargle reduces common bacteria in one's oral cavity. So in this regard, this product delivers exactly what it promised to do.- Convenient for travelers. Let's say you are going on a business trip and for whatever reason you would like to have access to salt water gargles. You have two options: you can either mix your own salt solution, or pack a few of these plastic tubes. Not sure about you, I certainly don't want to deal with the inconvenience of having to conduct my own science experiment in a hotel room.Cons- The tubes are NOT easy to open. The plastic tubes have arrow-shaped tips, and by all indications, these tubes are supposed to be opened by simply twisting and tearing off the tips. However, I just can't manage to tear open these rather tough and somewhat elastic plastic tips. I have to find a pair of scissors and cut open the tube every single time. Not an awfully inconvenient thing to do, but if I'm paying good-earned money for some salt water, I expect utmost convenience.- Speaking of paying good-earned money for some salt water, I think this product is somewhat overpriced. Sure, as I have indicated earlier, there are situations where these little plastic tubes can come in handy, but at the end of day, we are talking about SALT and WATER here. Two of the most cheaply available and naturally occurred chemicals. I'm not sure if the little convenience this product brings justifies its price - 17 dollars for 15 ounces of salt and water. Then again, there are folks who gladly fork out hundreds of dollars every year on oxygen at oxygen bar. So the pricing is not necessarily a con for everyone.- Perhaps the manufacturer was concerned with charging people so much money for some salt and water as well, they decided to add some ""values"" to their product, which beget salt water with Vitamin C, witch hazel, grape seed, rose hips, rosemary and sage. The reason why these Scarborough Fair ingredients were added to a perfectly working product is beyond me. There are scientific study after scientific study, suggesting that even the INGESTING these herbal ingredients have minimal or no effects on immune system response to cold and ailments, I'm very skeptical what the trace amount of these herbal ingredients would do to you when you're simply rinsing your mouth with it. Probably nothing, other than the psychological comfort of knowing that you're not paying for only salt and water.ConclusionUseful and but not necessary. Convenient in very limited settings and situations. If you're cheap like me, better off making your own slat and warm water rinse."

253580,0,I just moved to arizona from utah and my feet super dried out... i used to have perfect feet when i was using hempz original lotion.. then i moved and couldnt find my lotion so i looked here online and saw this and thought it was over priced.. so i went to ross and found it for 4.99 and bought it there and ive been using it for over a month now and my feet are still scratchy... i put it on at night and wear fuzzy socks over my feet when i sleep cause it seems to work with this stuff a little better.. but barely a difference.. some healing is going on but not smooth like they used to be... so i will not be buying this stuff again... (doesn't smell good either)i am going to give O'Keeffe's Healthy Feet Creme a try and see how that goes i will ordering that sometime in the next 24 hours and will be reviewing that aswell..

179365,0,"This soap really does what other people are saying: It cleans well. A quick look at the label will tell you that their main focus was to create a product that is environmentally friendly, deep cleaning (""it cleans the fibers""), and safe for sensitive skin.Pros:+Cleaned most of my laundry pretty well.+Cleanses your washing machine of any impurities that exist within the hoses and inner-workings.+Great for some sensitive skin.+No real need for softener, unless you want a scent.Cons:+Cleans deep, but not that deep. My workout clothes and sand-tshirts (i'm in the military) still have the odor of my deodorant. I've even gone so far as to pre-treat the arm area just to get a better wash, but it did nothing.+The scent, or lack of, resembles bleach. It has no bleach ingredients, however the leftover scent smells faintly of it. If you don't like the smell (I truly don't), it might drive you nuts (ie: pillowcases, comforters, etc)+Softener (I used 7th Generation's lavender scented) will make your clothes lose form. Tried it on a load of cargo shorts and they turned into gym shorts. SUPER soft, lost form though.+Some skin will still react. My wife has normal skin and hasn't had any issues with ANY soap in the past, but this made her itch.+Customer service is kind of lacking. Even the back of the bottle says ""We won't be happy to, but we will give you your money back if you aren't satisfied"". I wanted to return the product, read this, and completely forwent the fiasco. Why would I want to call in to a company when they warn you about their disposition to returns? Horrible."

I used about half of the product. I didn't think that the product smelled bad in any way, nor was I panicked by excessive smoke from the flat iron. My hair stayed straight, non frizzy and soft during the 48 hours but as soon as I washed it it went right back to curly.My hair was darkened slightly by the product but not damaged in any way. Since I received 2 boxes as a gift, I might do it again using a little less as a leave-in conditioner.As a curl remover it didn't work at all."

197078,1,I've been using this product for over 3 years now. In my opinion it's the best glass top cleaner there is out there. I've tried the Crema Bryte. Don't waste your money. It doesn't clean nearly as well as Cook Top does. With Cook Top I hardly have to use the razor scraper to scrape the burnt on food. It also adds a protection to keep food from sticking to your glass top.The bad thing is it's always out when I go to the store. I guess that's because it's such a great product. The good thing is you can buy it here on Amazon and get it in just a few days.If you have a glass stop stove. This is the cleaner you've been looking for.
256162,0,"I have been taking 2 capsules daily for about 4 weeks. I have noticed that I do feel happier (before taking it I couldn't even feel joyful at all). I haven't taken it long enough to see the full effects though. I look forward to seeing if it helps with my anxiety the way it did for my brother.I started out with 1 capsule a day and 10 days later decided to take 2 a day because I didn't feel any different. 2 Capsules a day seems to be the right dose for me. If you try this, just make sure that you give it time. It needs time to change the way your brain produces the ""happy"" feelings."

62312,0,"My pregnant wife got this to help with her posture at work and on long car rides. She really enjoyed it from the time we received it.The problem came up after use at work for a few weeks and over the course of a vacation trip car ride. The best way to describe the issue is that the roll lost its shape and became flat. When the lumbar roll was new after long sits it would gradually loose some shape and get squished, but it would eventually return to its round roll appearance. We noticed by the time we were on our way back from a rather long car trip it would stay deformed even after we let it try to return to the original state when we stopped for gas. My wife did try taking it back to work to attempt to use. After a couple of times she just ended up not using it because it lost its benefit.We've since ordered a ""firm"" version of this product from an Amazon seller (not sure if it was the same seller). She seems to like it a bit more, but she has not had it long enough to see if that one will end up the same."

It takes a ""dumber"" charge to raise the voltage above the threshold in order to put the battery back to service. So you have to keep two chargers around."

I was one of his clients.I have no scientific basis for reaching any conclusion about the efficacy (orpossible lack of efficacy) of Strauss Heart Drops for slowing or reversingthe gradual degradation of the circulatory system with age as is advertised.The product may be quite efficacious. Also, I know from my own experiencethat a high level of stress is associated with the calling of stock trading.There is also the issue, largely unaddressed by the fields of pharmacologyand medicine, of the resulting effects of taking various combinations ofpharmaceutical products (and possibly various foods and nutritionalsuppliments).But, the coincidence of my brother-in-laws death and having started usingthe product only a few months ago is too strong for me to ignore.

In fact, it feels very satisfying deflecting other bokken with this, and knowing it's practically indestructible helps. I would not go back to a wood bokken after experiencing this one. It's fantastic! I also love the shape and the feel, and if you swing it correctly you can hear the air ""whoooshhhh"" past it. I am confident this bokken will last for many, many years if not a lifetime of training."

376354,2,"Tried this product for a couple of weeks and have not noticed differences in anything... From some of the other reviews I have come to view somewhat of a common pattern, in short, those experiencing benefits tend to be using other supplements in conjunction with TribuPlex or because of other extraordinary physiological circumstances where natural testosterone levels are to a degree lower than optimal.My aspirations for this product were for many of the same reasons most of us try different supplements, such as amino acids, creatine, protein etc... notably metabolism, weight gain, muscle gain, energy so on and so forth, however, using other products I found a variety of results but with this product again, nothing noticeable.The reason I titled it with the word placebo and gave it 2 stars is because from time to time I have modified my diet, or taken a new supplement and found that initially it appears to work but after a short time as in several days to just over a week the benefits seemed to taper off and never able to regain their ""initial"" potency which leads me to believe psychological factors could be at play. The 2 stars rating is due to me stopping usage of this product after 2 weeks as I'm not much of a pill popper and based on my history if something isn't working after about 2 weeks it just doesn't seem to work, possibly for others this could be a different story."

259936,0,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way. I wish I'd just gone to my local CVS and got the Futuro to begin with because thats what I use now. I can't for the life of me find it online, but this blog has a photo of it. [...]"

129933,1,"Since moving, I've used a couple of products that have really been a life saved.One of which is the Swiffer Duster. There are several pieces in this line, the regular duster and the one with the Extendable Handle, which is what I got. It extends up to 3 feet so it makes it easy to get those hard to reach places. But what makes the Swiffer Duster such an improvement over a regular feather duster or rag is that the dust cloths are made from the same lint-attracting material as other Swiffer products. Instead of just pushing around the dust, the Swiffer duster actually collects it and removes it from the surface.With 2 refills (actually, I think mine had more), the Swiffer dusters themselves are easy to use. Shake them out to fluffy them up, slide them on the hand and you're ready to go.The nice thing about the extendable handle is that it pivots so you can set it an an angle to dust the top of something tall, like an entertainment center or perhaps even a ceiling fan.I found these really do pick up dust well and make the job a breeze. If there's 1 thing I'm not so fond about it's that the refills are relatively flat, not round like many feather dusters, so there's only 2 sides to use. However, Swiffer has a new 360 Duster that should do the trick for that."

Well, here what I found by using this product: definitely need time to get used to it; need to practice how to insert it correctly; to get to the stem to pull it out to empty the cup, you do need to put your fingers inside (not the biggest fan of this) as opposed to pulling a thread of a tampon; I still leaked a little; and getting it out was a bit uncomfortable and painful for me.As they say: ""either love it or hate it"".

40267,0,"I'll preface this by saying I take a lot of pregnancy tests, it took 5 years to concieve our first child and this time around I start testing early due to needing progesterone during the first trimester.I've had great experience with dollar store tests, always neg when not pregnant (and no strange lines) and positive when I was, and thought these would be about the same, wrong. For some reason I keep getting glaring white indent lines which I know are negatives but I find it annoying. They come up within the first minute so they are not evaporation lines. This has happened on 3 of the 5 test I have taken. I have not gotten pregnant yet so can't say how dark the positive test lines end up.Another thing that bothered me was the box they sent me expires in 6 months, yes I know that's half a year away but I would hope when buying a bulk of 25 tests they would at least have a years more shelf life. I've ordered the cheapie test strips from amazon and those have had a year or more left, I think from now on I'll just stick to the cheapie test strips and dollar store tests. And of course if I ever see a second line I'll confirm with a name brand test and a blood test at my doctors office.Hope you see your two lines soon!"
246129,0,"For the price, this product isn't that bad, but don't expect too much from it. The ""massage"" basically amounts to it vibrating a lot, which can feel somewhat nice, but not as much as I had expected. As a runner, I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end. The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all. You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However, being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice, and I do use it occasionally. I just don't think it should have been labeled as a""Pro Ultra."" There's nothing really ""ultra"" about it."

Again, should be fine (assuming they haven't been sitting in a hot warehouse in Nevada for 3 years) but wasn't as I expected.Last, they were just thrown in the box, no original packaging to tell me what I had. Again, they're condoms so they should be fine...just not very professional.An e-mail to their contact wasn't answered, I guess for the price it's not worth their time to make good on what I didn't get. They did include a coupon in the box for 10% off my next order from them (good at CondomMan only, not Amazon), maybe that's their way of making good in advance?So, I guess for the price this isn't a bad deal, but it sounds from the assorted reviews like ""your mileage my vary""."
18178,0,"This is the first sleeping mask that I've owned so I don't have much to compare it to...My wife and I got a laugh out of how closely the front of the mask resembles the look and feel of a bra. It does a pretty good job blocking light, my biggest qualm is it's not very comfortable. Regardless of whether I sleep on my back or side I'm always very aware that this thing is on my head. I think having the velcro straps is a nice concept. Unfortunately though they double the thickness of the straps creating almost a pressure point when sleeping on your back. Then when you sleep on your side the front of the mask tends to slide or bow just a little to allow more light in and sometimes it will get positioned to lightly touch my nose creating a itching or tickling sensation.I'll continue to use this mask for the time being however I'm not planning to sleep the whole night with it. I'll just leave it by my bedside and put it on early morning when excessive light starts to creep in."

I tried these as a free sample and take them regularly. This company lets you try a sample so that you can see how they work. I didn't find that you had to take more, I was able to take less because they cleased out all the bad stuff."

I tried to do a little self-diagnosis and pick up this knee brace, and to be honest - it made the pain worse. The brace is fairly comfortable, but it does tend to slip down (might have something to do with the fact that I'm 50lbs overweight). Seems like a basic knee strap might have been the better choice for me."

352330,0,"As a mom of three, I have always liked Pampers for when my children were infants and as they got older I adjusted brands based on fit and the body types of my children. I read all the reviews of the cruisers and I so wanted to love this diaper. There are things I do love: The softness of the diaper is nice. I like the thinness of the diaper and the fact that there is little to no bulk in the fit. Overall I have found the diaper to meet my expectations except for at night. Nighttime use has been leak after, leak, after leak. No matter how many times I change my son.My son is a wee-wee pusher if that makes any sense. He pushes so hard at night that the wee wee comes out the sides of the diaper. I am not sure if its the fault of the Pampers but I even tried to double diaper with a size 2-3 baby dry and a size 3 cruiser over that and the wee wee literally rolled down the mattress. This was after changing my son two hours prior. I recently tried Huggies Nighttime and so far no leaks at night. I like the look and feel of the Pampers better but I can't ignore a dry baby and sheets.Three children and just as many diaper brands tried. One diaper is not for all. Pampers are great but may not work in your situation-especially if you have a wee wee pusher like me!"
30234,0,"It's an entirely decent little machine, and seems to work really well for pretty much everything else--I'm a little cranky with the hose, as it narrows at either end, ensuring that things can get vacuumed up and caught in the hose. But that's a common issue, so I can live with it. What I can not live with is the stupid filter cover. The vacuum this is replacing (a beloved shark which lived a long life and deserves to spend the rest of its years on a nice farm) had a mesh filter cover thingie. Cat hair would mat up around it, dust could get through, and everything else stayed where it belonged. This one has a filter cover like a colander. Solid plastic with holes in it. And the holes are *just* the right size for small particles of clumping kitty litter to jam in them. So the filter itself gets dusty WAY too fast, and then on top of that the filter cover is packed solid with litter pieces, and I have to take it apart after every time I use it to clean up kitty litter, and wash the whole setup. I've fixed the problem by putting a knee-hi over the outside of the filter cover. I dare say it violates every warranty there is, and will probably make it burst into flames some day while I'm using it, but for now, it keeps the litter where it belongs, and my sanity intact."
41822,0,"I purchased this Oral B Triumph Professional Care 9400 because my old Oral-B electric brush just went out of commission after more than 10 years. In the product description, they said that Triumph would stop if you applied too much pressure. But that didn't seem to be so. What really happened is the 30 seconds timer. Whenever the timer expires, the brush just paused a few seconds before resuming the operation. This action signals the time that the user should switch to a different quadrant. I used to spend about 10 minutes to brush my teeth. The timer helps to keep me in check so that I wouldn't over brushing my teeth too much even though I often go over the limit of two minutes. I like the floss action brush head that comes with the order. It made my teeth feel exceptionally clean the first time I used it. I also used the Oral-B extra soft brush head to avoid damaging my gum. The three brushing modes are not necessary. The cleaning mode is the one you need most."
396337,2,"This product burns like rubbing alcohol when used inside of the nostril. (it says on the box it can be used in this way.) I enjoy using a neti pot for my dry painful nose... so I though this would be a good way to help my nose retain moisture. Forget about it! As soon as I applied it I at first felt relief ... but then slowly it started to burn.. next thing I knew I had a horrible burning nose, headache and pain between my eyes. I used the neti pot a 2nd time to wash it out... and thankfully that worked.Never again."
55132,0,Trying to save money so I figured I'd buy these to supplement the Jobst pair I need daily for standing or driving long distances. Unfortunately they form a tight line at the instep that gets worse as the day goes on inspite of tugging and straightening I may do stretch out the fabric evenly. I end up with a line across the front of ankle that looks like I wore a pair of shoes very tight straps (we called them Mary Janes). The size wasn't the problem. They stayed up and did not roll. I bought more than one pair and they all did the same thing.The overall quality was okay but I would be careful if you have circulation problems.

347764,0,"The smell for this is pleasant but I'm glad that I didn't pay a lot for it. If you're going to place it in a small bathroom and keep the door closed when the bathroom is not in use, I think it works fine. You won't smell it in a very large, well ventilated bathroom. And it's a waste to place it in even a small bedroom. You just can't smell it. However, pretty much every time I open my bathroom door (my bathroom is tiny), I can smell the light pleasant smell. So, I'm pleased about that.Now, if you do things like keep the litter box in the bathroom or if your bathroom wastebasket is overflowing, those scents will overpower the Renuzit. But if you don't have those issues, your bathroom is fairly clean, and your bathroom is small, it works . . . it worked fine for me and I only needed one. It's nice to not have to spray air freshener everywhere only to have it not last. It's nice to not have to light candles all the time - unless I want to - to freshen the room and then worry about the candles getting knocked over and causing a fire."

381386,1,Phosoplex has been working well for me. I was in a car accident in April and I have had severe problems with my right knee because of a partial tear in the ACL and PCL. Phosoplex has been very effective at subsiding the pain and lessening the discomfort. There has been a noticeable difference in my ability to put my weight on the knee and walking pain free. Overall it has been very good. Hopefully it will make me 100% pain free. Only more time will tell.
327828,0,"This thing needs and on/off button, a flow regulator and more flexible tubing.

343565,2,"I ordered this based on the great reviews it was getting, but I found that it just made me break out. I figured that would happen with a new product, but I went a good few weeks of this product and still very broken out. Not only that, but I have combination skin and I like something to make my skin feel clean, not oily. But I don't like anything that makes my skin feel dry, either. This moisturizer not only made my skin feel uncomfortably dry, but it left a really odd, chalk-y film on my face. I rubbed my face at work and some of the residue from the moisturizer came off on the tissue. So it's strange that it made me breakout. Maybe I got a bad batch?Another thing that confuses me is that it claims to repair sun damage, but how does it do that without offering sun protection? You would have to cleanse, use this moisturizer, and then 15 minutes later use a sunscreen, and then another 15 minutes later you apply the makeup if you wear it (the 15 minutes is to allow the moisturizers to absorb and work properly). That is WAYYY to much product to be putting on your face, in fact, your skin will only absorb so much. So unless you use this in the evenings only, or if you're completely out of the sun every time you use it, I'm confused as to how this is supposed to repair sun damage if it isn't protecting your skin. A one-step moisturizer and sunscreen is cheaper, less time-consuming, and always works better."

319004,1,"*** I did not purchase this through Amazon, but I did use Amazon reviews to aid me in my decision while looking into SAD lights, so I figured it would be fair to give back with a review of my own. Its better actually if there is one central spot where you can check product reviews. Who needs to search 20 different websites to piece various reviews together?I have not used this product for more than a week, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product yet, but even if I could, results differ from person to person. SAD lamps are proven to work in studies/trials so you should base a purchase decision like this in collaboration with your doctor in my opinion.Onto the review.-Size Can Matter-I thought it would be more beneficial to have a box which small size allows me to easily use in any part of the house, say if I want to watch TV or eat at the table, and for travel rather than a big one that provides you with more range of motion during use. The drawback is you have to stay relatively still in the same position during use, but you need to with all devices to a certain extent as your eyes must be facing the light (not staring at the source) to get the benefit anyway. So I saw more of an opportunity cost associated with the bigger lamps than the smaller ones such as the LiteBookElite. If find more personal benefit in using a portable box than one that provides a wider field of light.-White LED-MayoClinic.com had this to say: ""Does it use LEDs? Traditionally, light boxes have used fluorescent or incandescent lights. Some manufacturers are now selling light boxes with light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs can produce light in a narrower, more targeted wavelength. LEDs are also more efficient and lighter weight than standard lights, and appear to work just as well.""That's why I am comfortable with this products use of white LED. Although it is uncommon, this route allows you to avoid the risk of blue light damaging your eyes. Even if blue light is slightly more effective, so what? Big deal.-Questions Remaining-Should I shift the product to both my left and right during use? Or should I always leave it to the right of me like in the diagram displayed on their website? I feel like more light is being targeted into my right eye by leaving it to work from that side. I don't know if that will cause strain on the right eye while the left eye doesn't get enough light or whatever. Maybe I'm acting paranoid who knows.. I will ask the company about that in an email."

181910,0,"This transport chair was purchased for my mother who has just had her 92nd Birthday. Up to last year she could use a walker, but recently even going 20 yards was too much for her.With this light, compact chair it has been easy to move her around the seniors residence where she stays. It has allows use to visit more people and get to other floors and facilities with ease.It should be clear the person in the chair can not wheel themselves around, as it only small wheels.It is light weight and compact which makes it easy to manoeuvre in tight spots.The two brakes are at the back and can only be operated by the carer, which is fine. However, from our experience, if there is a change in carers, there has been cases where someone has tried to move the chair with the brakes on. This forces the brake mechanism out of alignment and may have to be re-adjusted.This is a low cost product and represents good value for money. However, it will not stand up to rough use over a long period of time.I would recommend it for family use."

I am still using them and think that I may start seeing improvement in the comfortability of my hands, but it remains up in the air. The looser feeling of the gloves does feel really good and make it easier to type. I would have also preferred that they use some softer or gelly like substance in the palms of the gloves instead of the bean bag type stuff they currently are using. Overall, if your hands hurt before, during, or after typing, these are definately something that you should at least try out for yourself."

47451,0,"I used this overpriced cream several times for knee soreness due to past injuries. In my opinion it works about the same as most external applications such as Ben Gay. The difference is that you don't actually feel any strong heat. As far as its effectiveness, I can't say for sure because I no longer have serious pain. Although it could be psychological, it did appear to help with my minor soreness. Whether it can be attributed to the Traumeel is debatable. According to my many hours of research on pain and muscle injury, I've read that most external applications (not including prescription creams and ointments) are minimally effective at best and are only useful for temporarily covering up the pain as opposed to help with healing. In my opinion Traumeel seems to be a simple over the counter treatment with minimal help (at best) for pain.Nathan"
267567,0,"I have extreme anxiety daily where I'm unable to concentrate at work a lot of times due to it and I have issues like concentrating too much on my breathing and really strange things. This product really doesn't help me or at least this bottle didn't. It didn't last long either if you take 40 drops 5 x's a day. I think the grain alcohol used to make the tincture is what relaxed me if at all. I may or may not give this another try. I really am looking for something natural that works like xanax, ativan or valium. Those are the only things that really make my anxiety disappear in the worst of situations but those meds, even though they are the greatest thing for anxiety, are also very harmful and I keep having to go to my doctor to get refills which is inconvenient.These tinctures also make my eyes feel a little heavy and I probably look tired - again I think its the grain alcohol."

49150,0,"I was really looking for something that DIDN'T taste like a protein drink. Maybe my standards are too high but this wasn't what I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong, it tastes okay but it definitely has a protein drink taste.It is also worth mentioning that I did have several of these that were damaged in shipping. In the product's and Amazon's defense, I don't think it was designed to be shipped via methods such as UPS or FedEx. However, Amazon's customer support is always outstanding and they promptly issued me a GENEROUS credit (talk about great customer service.)I'd suggest that anyone who does purchase these understand that there is a high risk of damage during shipping. Also, just because the lid is still tight doesn't mean that these are okay to drink. Squeeze the container and make sure there is no give. That confirms you still have an airtight seal. This product is very susceptible to mold and other air-born pathogens so even a slight dose of air can make the product dangerous to drink."

Also it is hard to adjust and so far I have not been able to get it to immobilize my shoulder any better than a regular sling can do.

Same results but once I was done, I just hopped in the shower and rinsed the sugar off with warm water. Its so easy to use. It can be done at room temperature. I was in love. Until, I looked at the ingredients! If you have the items to make lemonade, you can make this yourself. And it is so incredibly easy. And a fraction of the cost! All you need is two cups of sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 1/4 cup of water. (You can add a couple drops of tea tree oil and chamomile but don't really notice a difference.)

I can't find that the ingredient list is very different from the stuff I used to be able to find at the local drugstores."

No overcharging, it seems to FULLY CHARGE the big C & D sizes rather quickly, about 5 or 6 hours. Each battery size has it's own charging points, fixed contacts no springs sliding a metal bar against the battery, less stuff to wear out & break. You can charge AA ,AAA, C & D sizes but not 9 volt. about the only down side to this product. According to sales lit. with proper power cords you can charge around the world. Maha also makes wonderful rechargeable batteries have been using AA, AAA & D sizes for 6 months no problems so far. Mine cost about $ 90 twice what other cheaper crappier chargers go for(some cheapies don't charge big sized/highly rated mAh batteries fully) Thomas Distribution seems to be the cheapest & very reliable vendor."
210831,0,"I was very surprised by this product in many ways. As a first time used I was expecting it to be very painful all over. For me personally it was not painful on the legs or the underarms. I did get brave and tried it on the bikini area which was not that fun, and the arms which made me want to kill someone. So over all for pain was not as bad as I had expected. I was disappointed, however, that on the legs it did not remove all the hair. It took the coarser hair on my legs but even though some of the finer hairs were long enough I could not get that smooth feel that I desired. It does make them look smooth however so if that's what you are going for with this product, the appearance of smooth legs without the feel, then this is a great product for you."

If you can find a slightly bigger one that holds more chemical that would prolly be a better buy. This item was 7.99 when I bought it, a bit overpriced."

280040,0,"If you're looking for a cheap scale that just gives you a general idea of what your weight is, this one is fine. I've weighed myself consecutively as many as 10 times in a row, and the readings are not consistent. The weight reading also changes if you alter the position of your feet such as standing on it sideways or facing backwards. After years of use, practically weighing myself everyday, I'd say that the accuracy of this scale is about +/-3 pounds. I'm a fitness freak, so 1 pound changes in weight are significant to me. That makes this scale unusable for me. Don't even try using the body fat feature... it's absolute crap. This scale is ok for a casual user but it's definitely not for hardcore fitness management."
237938,0,"I recently purchased this nylon fiber Spout brush and while it does do a moderately decent job, once it's bent (even ever so slightly) it is very challenging to adjust it make to the original straight position. In addition, that little plastic nearest the tip of the brush is not at all very durable and mine broke only after only using the brush once and I was exceptionally careful.Luckily there is a fix for this and it is relatively simple. I would recommend soldiering the plastic cap to the wire itself to create a long lasting fix. But I will say, this brush does clean up well and while the fibers may not be twisted, the fibers are somewhat stiff, so at least that part of the brush is decent.However, if this tool is used in a water environment, it's likely to rust and eat away at the paint. So I would also recommend either using a product such as PB50 to prevent rust (it also has a variety of other uses as well. Or if more than rust protection is desired (for example, insulation, chemical, impact and heavy duty abrasion) I would strongly recommend Plasti dip. Plasti Dip provides all that and much more.Overall, this product is just okay, but I am fairly certain there are much better spout brushes out there."

7120,0,"I purchased this shaver 6 weeks ago after being very happy with a Wahl 4400 which I retired after inexpensively rebuilding it myself several times over 6 years. The new shaver arrived quickly direct from Amazon and the price was right at $40.88 including shipping and instant promo discount. (It also included a bonus personal nose/ear trimmer of which I have a drawer full of and none work very well). The shave is great and powerful enough for a week's shaves on a single charge, but be aware that the powerful Wahl's are louder than other brands. Unfortunatly, the pop up trimmer snagged and pulled my sideburns and neck hair, so I returned it to Wahl for repair per their advice. I received it back 3 weeks later along with a spare foil I had requested (although not the exact one I requested) to offset my $10 return shipping cost. Sadly, the pop up trimmer still snags hair, therefore I can only recommend the shaver if the trimmer is not important to you."

232333,0,"This is a good item for the price. I used it twice and it got damaged in transit. If the plastic sheath that covers the blades falls off and one of the blade covers bends ever so slightly inward, that's it, the unit is history. Panasonic should make a screw on plastic sheath to ensure it constantly protects the blade mechanism. Once bent inward, it is near impossible to get it back to where it was new. The blades won't spin ever again after that. I really like Panasonic. I own a PV GS500 camcorder and a ES8168S shaver - both fantastic products however, this item needs improvement."
167949,0,""" Just take this Mucinex, it will take care of those nasty allergies!"" Yeah great advice. Kicked those allergies butt and mine! I recently visited out in the country to see my friend and her cats. So I knew the night was going to be restless at best. But like any person up for last minute plans I didn't pack the essentials. Silly, silly me.So I took my friends advice popped in one of these ""magic"" pills in and voila! Instant snot fountain. Great so now my already irritated nose is being painfully scrapped away with this sandpaper called a tissue for all the hours of the night. It helped me stay awake so I could enjoy this splendor of a booger faucet that I couldn't turn off. So I crafted some nose tampons to help with the little shut eye I got.Oh long lasting! That's a relief! I would have thought like most medicines that it would have been a quick and temporary reprieve from my allergies. But no, this super duper mucus evictor isn't slowing down yet! Now 24 hours later, two rolls of toilet paper, and mild dehydration sitting in I am eating some benadryl and getting some shut eye.Warning: Only take this medicine if you have the free time to be a mess of used Kleenex with a nose that would rival poor Rudolf.

130820,0,"I first heard of the Noni Juice on Dr. Oz. Admittedly I am always skeptical and after my household (thanks in large part to my very loving wife), we have not noticed any true health benefits. It is true that this stuff stinks: we have a 2 year old and a 2 month old and this stuff does smell worse than the diaper genie at the end of the week. Genesis Today says that this juice has bitterness and power. Both are true. What we have found to be the best method to take (not drink) the noni juice, is to put it in a shot glass. Take the shot and immediately chew gum, in the hopes of taking the taste away. We have heard that there are less ""pure"" Noni juices (e.g., Noni99), but our philosophy has always been if you are going to suffer anyways, you might as well maximize the upside potential. However, as suggested, we just haven't seen any benefits. We will obviously continue to drink the juice, because: (1) we bought a six pack and (2) we wouldn't give this even to our worst enemy. Hopefully we will have some noticeable benefits, and if so, I will gladly update my review to reflect such benefits. :) With that said, I have heard that it works for some, so I would encourage everyone to try it, if they think it may help, with the obvious caveat of buyer beware."
368957,0,"I started taking ribose early 2012 as part of Dr Stephen Sinatra's 'awesome foursome of cardiovascular health' (along with magnesium, carnitine and CoQ10) and because it was recommended by Dr Sherry Rogers for those with poor mitochondrial function.When I take CoQ10 (especially the reduced ubiquinol form), carnitine and magnesium it makes me feel more well. Less ill and like my body is struggling less with basic functions. I sleep better and longer, and my heartbeat feels stronger and less flutterly and weak, it takes more to bring me to a point of overexertion and if I do still seriously overexert, these things very much stop the relapse from being as severe and scary. (I have severe cardiac problems and neurological problems partly caused by poor mitochondrial function.)Even at higher doses of these things (plus B complex and vitamin C), they never feel anything like taking a stimulant would and never keep me awake or make me agitated. But I have found ribose to be quite different.I started ribose at a dose of 1 - 2 grams a day for about 2 weeks. I didn't feel much at this dose so I went slowly up to a 5 gram a day dose (taken in two doses of 2.5 grams). After a few days I began to feel strange and a bit 'unrestful' and anxious, but I wasn't sure if it was the ribose causing it so I kept going. The next day or two I knew something was really off and wrong. I couldn't sleep until 5 in the morning, found it really hard to get in a restful state of mind and spent hours so physically tense that I was a hairs breadth away from grinding my teeth - something I have never done before or since. The pressure in my jaw was just huge and if I were well enough I'd probably have paced the room too. No amount of meditation helped with the sleeping or the jaw tensing either. It was obviously a physical effect form the ribose that I had to wait to wear off.It felt like I had taken a huge dose of slow-release caffeine (or an illegal stimulant), but one which had a cumulative effect and built day by day. Fake energy I guess, nothing at all like the real thing. I stopped taking the ribose the next day. This overstimulated effect then took 2 -3 days to subside. It wasn't pleasant. I wonder if it causes a big rush of adrenaline like taking lots of caffeine does. I am not at all sure if it does or not but it felt a lot like that, at least, and just as unhealthy.I really wanted to make sure it wasn't just a coincidence though and an effect caused by some other variable. I didn't want to miss out on something potentially helpful unless it was really necessary. So 4 times I tried the ribose again in the same way, over 4 months, and each time I got the same effect. It was definitely the ribose. For me ribose pushed my body into getting hyped up and writing cheques that it couldn't cash.Ribose is quite well known to be not well tolerated by some people. That is why I chose to try this supplement last, years after taking the far safer and better tolerated carnitine, ubiquinol and magnesium.I have no criticism of this brand though. I buy lots of Jarrow products and it is a good brand and no doubt this is a good product, for those that it works well for. This supplement really helps some people with serious heart conditions I know (from reading books by the above authors), and doses of 5 - 15 grams are commonly used and have a good effect, but I am just not one of them. Maybe it is just biochemical individuality.I'd be curious to know if others have had the same problems with ribose that I have, if anyone has the time.For anyone wanting to try this I'd say make sure you take it for 3 - 4 weeks and at a least at a dose of 5 grams a day before buying a second bottle as any negative effects may take this long and this high of a dose to appear."

43888,0,"No complaints about the accuracy of this fat loss monitor EXCEPT when inputting information for ""athletes"" over 60. There is an easy formula for determining if someone is considered an athlete or a ""normal"" person in the instruction manual. Unfortunately, the ""athlete"" input only goes from 18-60. The ""normal"" activity mode is from 10-80; apparently, Omron must figure people over 80 aren't athletes OR engage in ""normal"" activity.I just contacted the company to find out how one should input the information if an athlete is over 60; the monitor gives a different output in each case. I tried it by inputting ""athlete"" at 60 years old, even though the individual is 68. I then input the same information, but this time I input the individual as 68, the correct age, but as ""normal."" I got two different readings.

390093,0,"I'm a medical assisting student doing an externship for my last semester. I wanted a better quality stethoscope than the Prestige I have now, so I decided to purchase a Littmann. I primarily use the stethoscope for taking blood pressures and my main concerns are clarity and accuracy. The sound quality is pretty good, but it's not that much better than the (much cheaper) Prestige Medical Dualhead I bought on Amazon before. For being 7 times more expensive and having a reputation of being the best of the best, I expected a lot more. The soft earbuds are easier to wear and it's not all that heavy around my neck. That said, my Prestige is lighter and doesn't slide around as much. The hard earbuds are annoying but that doesn't make the Littmann worth 7 times more. I got the ceil blue color, which is almost like a shiny gray, but still looks pretty good and unique. Here's hoping it lasts a *really* long time because something's got to make it worth the money. Simply put, I'm still waiting to be impressed."

38848,0,"The test was easy enough to use. However, it was messy, as the urine collection pad didn't have a cover on it. You have to place it on the table with the collection pad facing downwards (since the result window is on the other side) and that resulted in a most unhygienic and messy situation with urine on the table. I found that to be the biggest drawback. Also, reading the results wasn't easy; there's a difference between the darkness of the lines, even if you have two lines that would indicate a positive result. I think it's an average product."
83258,1,"I have taken several different brands of Multi's over the years, but something was just not right with the brands.

I then took a small chance on this product from other reviewers' word. Much to my surprise, this vitamin is gentle on the stomach, includes compounds that your body absorbs much better than other brands, and I just feel great!"

320938,0,"I got this squeegee to clean the glass doors of a steam shower. The squeegee itself works well, but you have to be VERY careful when you are using it around shower hardware. My door handle has an oil rubbed bronze finish..and not a cheap handle either. I was cleaning around the handle and the squeegee barely touched it and scratched off some of the finish on the handle. The stainless steel is kind of sharp right near the blade and it doesn't take much to scratch certain finishes. I bought a silicone gripped squeegee for the steam shower and threw this one in a different shower that only had tile and chrome fixtures. I'll still be careful around the fixtures though. It looks nice and works well, but I wouldn't buy stainless again."

I can barely get through a good shave of both legs on one charge. The motor sounds noticably 'slower' than it did in the beginning.Also, you probably need to buy new blades for it more often than I do. The shave started getting 'spotty' (leaving uncut hairs) after only about 10 shaves.Again, it's alright, especially for the price. But I think there are better shavers out there with more value."

230386,0,"Pros: Very good at relieving the pain, sticks well. The minty flavor is refreshing. It is easy to put on and just the right size.Cons: Sticks to your teeth as well if your sore is near the teeth. The first time I tried, I kept my mouth closed and waited 30 minutes for it to set. When I tried to open my mouth to see how it looked, it was stuck to my sore on one side and my tooth on the other. I tried to gently pull it off, but within the hour it came off. The other con is that depending on where your sore is, it can make your lip appear very bulky. It says that the patch spreads out, and it does, but it is still extremely thick, which is very noticeable and annoying. Because of the thickness it makes it very hard to eat or drink, so hopefully your sore is somewhere more convenient.They are also a bit expensive, I got mine for $10 and they only come six to a pack."

They somewhat worked for a little while, but they don't completely get rid of the red patches.... They work, but they are more expensive and they don't work as well as something real simple....OK, here is what works for my child: (1) I apply a thick layer of Cetaphil cream (not the lotion)all over after bath or whenever the skin looks irratated, (2) I stopped using any baby wash until the condition greatly improved, then only use baby wash no more than once a week, and rinse well. At the beginning, I applied Cetaphil on her several times a day. After about two or three days, all the redness went away. In the past 14 months, Cetaphil cream has been what keeps my little girl's skin looks perfect."

But the other materials are about half the thickness I pictured and way too slick.With a few modifications such as sewing a good liner to the inside and putting on a keeper so the slack feeds straight into the buckle and does not then slip loose . . . it would be a very good belt and worth fixing.The manufacturer dropped the ball on an excellent design by skimping on some of the materials!
96050,0,I just received the Andis T-Outliner trimmer 04710. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my son. My daughter had ordered one for her cousin two months earlier. He had nothing but great things to say about it. He was even concerned about her spending that much money(which he was guessing it had to have cost). I was looking forward to my son to be just as ecstatic about his:but now I am in a pickle. It came sooner than the estimated date:I was very pleased about that. But it also came opened box and it looked used it had small scratches on the blade and it seemed oily with like fragments of material shedding . Now I am debating whether to return it and reorder hoping it will arrive before Christmas(a week away).

425417,0,"Just received and set up this mirror on my vanity/desk. I wish I had paid closer attention to the size dimensions, because it is pretty small for what I wanted it for. However, that is my fault. If you have limited space, 9"" x 12"" (fully extended) may work for you. There are several color settings for the lighting such as day, evening, home and office. The day is bright white, the office turns me green, the evening is just kind of dim, and the home gives me a rosy glow. If lighting in restaurants were like the home setting, I would be a happy person. I'll never use the office setting and probably not the evening. I think day has the most honest light, so I will probably use that the most.The mirror is made of plastic which gives it a cheap look and feel, but it will do the job. The competitor mirrors were all made of plastic, too, so I don't really hold that against it. I liked it for the folding sides, so that it can be angled to see different areas. This is a nice feature and the sides stay in place where I set them. It was not expensive, so it is a decent value for the price.There are warnings on the mirror and paperwork enclosed that flickering may occur. This did happen a lot after I first set it up. There is a gas in the lamps that moves about and it was probably stirred up from shipping. I turned it on and off a few times, like the warning said to. It helped some, but the flickering didn't go away right away. I tapped lightly on the light and it eventually settled into a steady light. Honestly I think most of this flickering was due to shipping and it just needed to settle. It says flickering can happen from uneven electrical current from your outlet, too. If that happens, it says to turn it on and off until it goes away. I am not there yet."
191377,0,"Everywhere on the internet I have found that the Kriegar brand sucks. If you have no idea how to make knives razor sharp then don't buy this razor.

I was able to make mine razor sharp. Good luck."
330428,1,"I've been a Norelco user for years, needed a new shaver, and was taken by the design of this new model. After reading the reviews, I expected to get my usual ""Norelco shave"" - not as close as when I shave with a straight-blade razor, but the best of the electrics. My skin is too sensitive to shave with a straight-blade razor every day. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the resulting shave was as close as I can get with a straight-blade - without the irritation. The angle of the shaving surface is steeper than the regular model, requiring you to keep your hand and arm higher than might be used to, but I got over that in the first two weeks - and, was happy to change given the quality of the shave. The only thing stopping me from giving this product five stars is the equally steep price. Norelcos are never inexpensive, but this one really pushes the limit!"

252763,0,"I bought this product as an impulse buy. I don't have fine lines or large pores. Using this product, I didn't see a difference in my skin. I was trying to soften the sides of my nose. It's a breathing ground for black heads.I bought this product because I saw the Youthful Essence Informerial on TV. I wanted the product badly and instead of ordering Youthful Essence, the stores had Neutrogena . The paste has the same main ingredient, aluminum oxide crystals.The paste used is gritty as it's suppose to be but I didn't feel like it was doing anything. When it was time to wash it off, I had to rub it off, not rinse it off.Pros:1. It's battery powered, so you can take it wherever you like.2. The amount of paste is good.3. If you don't like the paste Neutrogena offers, you can either make your own or buy another brand.You can probably use a facial paste that you use in the shower with microbeads and use it with the scrubber. That could be a cheaper solution.4. The scrubber has a stand.5. Comes with two sponge heads.Cons:1. It's battery powered, so you'll have to replace the batteries.2. The paste is icky.3. You cannot use it in the shower or submerge it in water.4. The sponges are not that easy to clean but it's not that hard either.I haven't used Youthful Essence but Neutrogena and Youthful Essence seem like the same product.To compare them both:PRICE: Youtful EssenceNeutrogena comes with a tool, 2 sponges, and paste for $40.Youthful Essence comes with a tool, 2 sponges, the paste, and some extra bonuses (like a facial brush attachment and a body scrubber) for $40.TOOL: Youthful EssenceNeutrogena's tool is not waterproof. Kit only comes with 2 sponges.Youthful Essence's tool is waterproof now. I believe it wasn't before. The Youthful Essence's tool comes with more attachments like the body scubber. I believe Neutrogena has a separate tool for the body so you'll have to spend more money.Both are battery-powered.REFILLS: NeutrogenaNeutrogen's paste refill and two sponges, that's about $25.The Youthful Essence's website it says a 60-day supply (I don't know what that means probably one jar) and 2 sponges for $40.If the pastes are exactly the same, I couldn't find the ingredients to Neutrogena's paste on their website.So if the pastes are exactly the same, I would say buy the Youthful Essence kit and buy the Neutrogena refills."

67871,0,"I'm a lotion girl. I bought this product based on the reviews here, so I don't really have any other body oils to compare it with. But this product could be better if it was more of a body oil spray because a light squeeze brings you a lot of oil on your palm. Too much oil. You only need a little bit to go along way.I like the lightness of sesame oil from Neutrogena. But I wanted to get an alternate organic product. I'm not sure I made the right decision. The oil is a little too thick for me. The smell also reminds me of some sort of Hawaiian tropic oil (suntan lotion). I prefer a lighter and cleaner scent. But do I hate it? No. It's just okay for me."

97576,2,"The basic product does what it is supposed to do; however, there are small very scratchy fibers that stick out of the ends where the Velcro is sewn in. I think these are actually hard plastic fibers from the Velcro that are protruding through the covering fabric. When you fasten it on, if you do not position it exactly right, the little `stickers' bite into your skin and are extremely uncomfortable. In my case I had to repeatedly interrupt my workout to adjust these so they did not irritate my skin. The problem got worse the longer I used them. After a while it was very aggravating, to the point they were not useable no matter how carefully I adjusted them. They went into the garbage and I'm now using another brand, the ""Futuro Sport"" adjustable by 3M, which is available on Amazon."

Are you kidding me?My doctor actually recommended these supplements and I'm pissed because if I had known what they contained I never would have purchased them. I will never buy these supplements again unless the manufacturer of this product develops more ethical standards for their product. These supplements act virtually the same way on the body that candy. Trans fat increases the level of triglycerides in your blood and eventually leads to complications of the heart like Coronary heart disease. I believe ingesting products that contain these same ingredients is the reason so many people in this country suffer from high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity.

10071,0,"I purchased the set because I like the smooth flow of Waterman ball point pens and the style (cigar-shaped) fits my hand well. The only things I was concerned about were the brass lining and the 0.5 mm lead for the pencil.The cigar-shape does fit me well and I am quite pleased with that. The concern about the brass lining is still a slight concern. Since I collect vintage pens and pencils, I know that a writing instrument does not need to be heavy to perform well. The old instruments were light because they were used for long sessions of writing and to not tire the hand. In at least the last 20 years or so, manufacturers of quality writing instruments try to equate weight with quality. It doesn't correlate. Think of the Lamy 2000 set. Its a tough, lightweight plastic and typically is listed among the top performing instruments. The 2000 is Bauhaus designed and is close to the cigar shape. The only thing I don't like about the 2000 ball point is the lightness (less contrast) of their ink compared to the Waterman. The 0.5 mm Waterman pencil is better than I expected. The ferrule that hold the lead seems to be such that the lead doesn't always break when I'm writing.All in all, the purchase was good, but the combined pen and pencil can drag down on some shirt pockets. I'd give 3 stars out of 5!"

377100,2,"Using this product during mosquito season in Alaska resulted in roughly 3x the bites as the low percentage deet formulation it replaced in our toolbox. It does not cut down significantly on the mosquitoes attracted as deet does, but it does appear to prevent a decent percentage of insects that alight upon your skin from actually biting.On windy days with light bug pressure it works quite well, but anytime the wind falls we now become a swarming mass of bugs even with heavy applications. Probably suitable for low-pressure areas with limited bugs, we can top 1,000 bites/hour in many areas and it just doesn't cut that number down to a ""sane"" level even if it does block MANY if not all or most of them. We will be looking for other deet alternatives over the next week, in the mean time we're wearing full bug netting, gloves & duct taping collars.Only recommended for suburban backyards with low biting insect numbers."

408861,0,How else can you find egg protein powder at this price for free shipping. How good it tastes depends on how hungry you feel and how much you think you're saving. Good for weight loss because you probably cannot down enough to gain weight. You may want to add sweetener. Not BAD for you. Doesn't mix extremely well. Overall reasonable product.
406184,0,"I'm not going to suggest that this product works or doesn't. My concern is this; I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago and, for what it's worth, the delivery time was outstanding. It was at my door even earlier than promised. But, at the same time, I purchased another product, from the same company, called Libido-XY. One product claiming to make it bigger. The other claiming to make it work better. What man wouldn't want that? As to whether the products work, I don't know. I don't feel as if I've used them long enough to offer a valid opinion. But, as best I can tell, they are the SAME product with different labels. And, of course, different prices. This both annoys me and concerns me. First, in my opinion, that shouldn't be legal. They(the company) do publish, in plain sight, the ingredient list of both products. I should have paid closer attention. But, when both products are offered together, as package deals, you would think they would be two different products. As I mentioned, I believe that marketing one product as two, with different names, different claims and different prices, should not be legal. But ""caveat emptor"", right? Here's my real concern: The instructions advise not to exceed 6 capsules daily on both products. That's double the recommended dose. If someone thought they were taking two different products, and weren't paying attention, they could quite easily take as many as 12 capsules daily. I doubt that it would be a serious problem. I don't know that ""overdosing"" on the product would be harmful. But there should at least be a cross-warning on the bottles to use care when using ""similar"" products. I don't intend to purchase these particular supplements again simply because of the marketing ploy."

But once I krazy glued it in, let it sit it was good to go! Also, one more thing, CLEAN OUT THE BRUSH. oxyclean. let it sit in soap. ANYTHING. it wreaks of fresh badger! lol"
394492,0,"The tub itself is very nice--a good size with nice features like grippers and contoured parts. The shower, however, stopped working after only 4 baths and was only a small stream of water when it did work. We still use the reservoir portion to have some clean rinsing water handy, but the sprayer is useless. If you purchase this product for the tub itself, you will be pleased."
369892,0,"NO-Xplode works for a lot of people, and it worked for me on the first cycle. I took time off like it says and the second cycle doesn't feel the same. I think my body adapted to it, so watch out for that."

79134,0,"I have loved the flavor of regular Gold Standard Double Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream, but I just received this natural version and find it almost undrinkable because it has such an extreme artificial sweetener taste. I don't have the ingredient list with me at the moment, so I can't see the sweetener that is used--I guess it has to be something natural, maybe stevia?--but whatever it is, there is too much of it. With the other powders I would mix with milk, but this one was so strong that I have to mix with water and use only 3/4 of a scoop instead of a whole scoop just to be able to drink it (and that is not even enjoyable)."
226525,0,"I'm a medical student. This one is not quite suitable but unfortunately I bought it based on the multiple positive feedbacks from the other buyers.To measure BP by yourself, maybe this one is fine. But I do measure for other people, it's annoying -- the pad is attached to the wrap. Someone mentioned the case is good but that's not usable at all when you hooked everything together.Don't buy this model if you want to help others."
65765,0,"These are great to use, as long as you use them right away. I used the orange and the pink jimmies, and the leftover pink ones, left in the original packaging, lost their color after a few weeks. They might to better if you save them in a different container."
228936,0,These are entertaining to watch her squirm. Always a good time. Good value for couples fun. Shipped quick and discreetly.
383752,0,"This glove fit pretty good however, I needed it for my left hand and the padding is on the wrong size for true comfort. The description said that the glove could be used for either hand but I think the product should be available in right hand and left hand sizes. Overall the glove has helped protect my hand from strand and stress from my daily activities."
129166,0,"This stuff is good, I bought some in the past so I checked the price, and it was high. I bought the same stuff at Sams (in the Sams brand) and it is great and has no fishy aftertaste."

309626,0,I do not see any difference in this razor than My other brawn razor which I had for years ( brawn 7550 ) I realy wanted to see a big improvement but I did not for the price of this item I expected alot better.
284481,0,I am not super excited about this product! It's made of really firm material makes it uncomfortable to use for more than a minute or so.
139346,0,"I have used many brands of HCL as I have to take it prior to eating in order to avoid severe stomach pain. I picked up the Solaray recently when my go-to brand was out of stock. While it does work (it is HCL, after all) you don't get much bang for your buck. While I only take 2 pills of my go-to brand before each meal, I had to take at least 5 Solaray capsules to get similar results. It would probably be a good choice if you need a low dosage of HCL, but if you are like me and need around 1200mg with each meal, this is not the economical choice."
333258,0,"I had great expectations for this razor after reading about it on this and other sites. Unfortunately, it doesn't give a very good shave when dry. Works fine wet, but I find that to be a pain. I've had better luck with razors with three pivoting heads, and I'll have to get one of those next time."
380007,2,"I'm surprised Amazon is selling this low quality item. If you read the reviews on the King size pad with the same features, it's more accurate. This did not get warm enough even on high. I used it exactly two times over a two day period and then it died. It's not worth the warranty fee of $5.00 plus the postage to return it to Homedics. Pure junk."
42742,0,Good shaver but let down by poor battery life. Lucky to get 3 or 4 shaves from one charge. Surely the battery should last longer than this. I previously had a similar model but the battery life was much better than this one. Maybe with Remington newer doesn't necessarily mean better.
350862,0,"It's much lighter than the other brace I bought (ShockDoctor) and very comfortable to wear, and easy to put on. But it's not well made; One of the seams is already coming apart and I've worn it fewer than ten times."
275928,0,"Even though the dimensions are listed in the description these seem small and we can not use the hood at all, it will not go over our toddlers average sized head, I doubt it would fit most babes over 6 months old. We gave it 3 stars because 1. we can still use the body of the towel, 2. it is fairly thick (not like a thirsty adult towel) compared to hooded towels found at the ""Super Stores"" and 3. it is still putting organic next to skin."
215490,0,"By all the reviews I expected something a bit more secure and sturdy. I don't feel there is enough weight on the pad to feel firm on my skin. The one velcro stick on belt really needs to have a more velcro to secure pad better. It seems like there should be a much better non expensive way to secure this in place.I returned mine, am waiting on company response."
306595,0,These have an orange essence smell to cover any fish odor but it doesn't work. They smell like fish and oranges.I HATE fish and therefore cannot tolerate these. Otherwise they seem good and the pill size of these softgels is smaller than most DHA/Omega 3 type of softgels. It's comparable to a Vitamin E softgel size if that helps.
165159,0,"I feel the quality of the way this is made is strong but the design did not take to much consideration into the process and requirements of a good shaving head cutters.The cutter blades slotted covers that glide across your face, those three heads have a similar softness to low grit sandpaper.They could have smooth everything out and this would be a 5 star review for the replacement items are all made very well they just did not get the final polish that would have finished the product."
28200,0,"While I am happy with this purchase as far as the shipping and quality of the product. The taste is absolutely horrid. Yes, it is that bad. I will be trying a new flavor from the same company next time."
299740,1,I am pleased with the service and the product. The order came within 10 days from the time of placement
127059,0,"This mask is comfortable and has a lot of room for your eyes to open and close comfortably should you choose to do so. I haven't worn it so much that it's worn out as the other reviews said it does, so I can not comment on that, but I have found one significant problem: The mask is contoured to fit your face quite nicely if your face happens to fit the mold of the mask. If not, it will naturally fit wrong. In my case the bridge of my nose is not a smooth gentle slope, but rather has an arch or cliff to it. It's not all that big, nonetheless it causes the mask to &#34;float&#34; above my cheeks at the bottom. This lets light in making the mask a failure in it's primary objective. Though this is with my face. With yours the story may be different."
397732,0,"Once again, the AMO product is overpriced for what you get. You can buy a generic brand and get a better cleaning than this product does. Pliagel is a lot better and costs less, so does a store brand. Save your money on this product - it's just too costly for what you actually receive. Plus, it doesn't really do that great of a job cleaning your lenses. It burns my eyes whenever I've used it."
147831,2,The blades on these cartridges were very good in their day. These cartridge blades aren't nearly as sharp as they should be. I suspect they were manufactured long ago and have dulled over time. They are still usable. Doesn't seem to be the kind of product that ages well. Or maybe I just got a bad batch.
102655,0,"These bars have a great texture and I love the 20g protein content but the vanilla almond flavour was almost too sickeningly sweet. I was able to eat them, just not my favourite...I guess stick with what you know and I know I LOVE the chocolate mint builder bar! TASTES SO GOOD!"
63762,0,It's not for beginners. When it is lubed up it can be very slippery. The suction cup part is pretty much useless because the thing is so huge and heavy. It can be somewhat cumbersome to deal with...i guess i'll keep working on it...but it is hard to handle sometimes.
329424,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
77127,2,I have the worst upstairs neighbors anyone could have and I bought this product because of all the positive reviews. This machine is so quiet that you can't tell it is even on and for the price they have got to be kidding. I am returning this product immediately and I want a full refund of my money because I wasted it on this piece of junk. Turning my TV up and playing my radio is the best way to drown out the idiots upstairs.
373793,0,Although the product works well. The roll on is nothing to bring home to mom. It doesn't quite roll therefore you have to press very hard against your head and face to get it to roll. Even then it doesn't roll very well. But what you gonna do? If there is a better way to apply this product please let me know.
241286,0,"I've been putting up a lot of weight, have 7 days left but my stomach is getting upset every day!Will finish it nonetheless but should not buy again!"
243326,0,Paid top dollar for this product direct from Rubis - arrived missing the protective covers. Very disappointed for the money paid - otherwise the tweezers are ok. Will not buy from Rubis again.
255148,0,"I was quite excited to receive this as a gift at my baby shower but was a little disappointed to open it and find only 4-5 medicines included. Behind the cardboard advertisement is absolutely nothing, so it looks more stocked than it actually is (thinking I would have everything I need in one kit). Plus 2 of the stuffy nose/cold meds are things you have to put directly in the baby's nose (not a big fan of spraying/dropping things in a squirmy, irritable baby's nose anyway) - plus one of those is a non-medicated saline spray (saline spray for $20?). I just wasn't overly impressed with the meds and thought name-brand meds could be bought separately- much cheaper- on an as-needed basis."

102788,0,The readings vary a lot even if you measure in quick succession. We figured it shows the measure on the higher end and to get a realistic measure just subtract 10 from both the readings (according to my boyfriend)!!
123215,0,"Well creatine is creatine.. except this one theoretically helps shuttle more creatine into your muscles with the carb rush (insulin).. sounds great.. it does make you bulkier quick, so you better want to be bulky if you take this.. and you do feel about a 5 to 10% increase in energy when working out I'd say.. its good, it sounds good, mostly its the placebo effect I think when it comes to the energy.. so its a neutral to good supplement, but I don't see why you shouldn't buy it..."
181043,0,"Does it really cost a bunch more to give this a slightly thicker pad? It is a decent table, but it is a little hard. I suppose some people might prefer that, but I want something that cushions me a bit and supports my back when I am on my stomach when getting a massage."
238987,0,We bought this item a little while ago and find that it's a very reliable little heating pad. It certainly does its job. The chord is pretty stiff and could be uncomfortable for some.
12331,1,"I'm finally gonna let this out of the bag and let others in on a little secret. This product WORKS, and might be the only thing I'll take and TRUST beside Muscle Juice (more carbs though, which I mix together to help me appreciate the blander, yet fuller scope of the quality protein in this product, comparatively). I'm gonna be honest here, I didn't initially post my rave reviews because I actually appreciated this item being in stock every time I needed to restock. Let's just say I was ""testing"" it to see if it was worthy of a review first!I'm not gonna talk about how much muscle I've gained using this, because user experience may vary (yada yada) and you may even gain more than me, but I will say it DOES WORK, and that you'll possibly be smarter than the masses who still over complicate the equation and falsely believe that artificial sweeteners can save you from unwanted weight gain in certain areas. Think about it, if you're taking something to gain weight (hopefully muscle) you use the nutrients for energy, right? Or you could expel it, or just not use as much...Be wise, and do your research.The 1200 version has more calories (energy) for your tenacious workout session, than the 900 (which has those terrible tasting artificial sweeteners, which the jury is STILL out on; why bother?) and it also stocks enough vitamins and minerals (you do the research) to not need to take multivitamin before or after your workout. One caveat for those of allergen concern, this product may be produced in facility that also processes shellfish, but I do have FAR GREATER trust for this company's QUALITY CONTROL system relative to other brands out there (aside from TWINLAB & NOW products, and I've tried a GREAT deal of them, and read reports on others).I love this product!"
149747,0,"Full Disclosure: I am comparing this protein powder more or less directly to the Cytosport Whey Vanilla Protein commonly found at CostCo. This is simply because the Cytosport bag is what I had used directly before.ON vanilla whey protein has a relatively neutral taste, but is largely unsweetened. This leaves it tasting bland unless combined with something deliberately sweet. Additionally, it tends to clump both in water and milk, which is frustrating to me after using the Cytosport, which dissolved quite nicely in water, at least.In short, it'll do, but it's not the best I've ever used. If you have a use for it (baking, perhaps?) which requires it to not be too sweet, it may be perfect. For the usual shakes and quick mixes, however, I'll be going back to Cytosport, which is cheaper at CostCo anyway."
11689,0,"I'm addicted to sprinkles. They tend to be very expensive at the grocery stores, so I decided to try this kind. I received the product in timely manner and well packed. However they don't taste like the kind your would get from a Yogurt place or grocery store. The sprinkles do taste fresh, but they are too sweet and it overpowers the ice cream/yogurt taste. If you don't really care much about how sweet they are, then go for this kind. On the other hand, the chocolate sprinkles from this company do taste much better than this rainbow kind."
153979,0,This product is okay. I rate it a 3 on a scale of 1-5. It is not a top quality instrument. You get what you pay for
333798,2,"Like the other reviewers, I was initially impressed with this. I too remember the bulky, sink top unit I used in the 70's. After oral surgery recently, I asked the dentist how to prevent the ocurrance, and he recommended a Waterpik. I travel a lot, so I bought the portable. After just about six months of use, my unit died last night. It sounds like the impeller (part of the pump) sheared a pin, so all I get is a high pitched whine from it... These are my observations:Battery life is not great, but acceptable. I noticed a perceptible decrease in performance after 4 or 5 days of using the unit without recharging. It's a pain to have to travel with the adapter so you can recharge this thing in the hotel all the time.Water volume and pressure were very good, so no complaints there. It really does clean the gum line and other areas very well, so doing this cleaning ritual is very important to oral health. It is very important to read the instructions on the proper use of this thing, or you'll do more harm than good.Reservoir size is small, but that is the price to pay for a travel sized unit. Waterpik does include a two (2) year warranty, but you must have the original receipt for warranty service. After reading other reviews, I'll be purchasing the Panasonic portable."
105497,0,"this is a good value, but it isn't the best. Kind of billed as a catch all product. Your better to do each cleanse seperate if you want to do it right."
201519,0,"the pad is good, it delivers moist heat like it says and does heat up fast, but i didnt like the fact that it cooled down before the set time and didnt stay at the temperature you set, but still its not bad, you just need to set a higher temperature than you want so it doesnt get too cool......"
184182,0,"There have been times when dentists have recomended rinsing with salt water. I'm not a dentist but there is a good use for this product and it is very convenient. If you are in need of this, I would consider buying this item."
169705,0,"In my case, the stains (greasy, cooked over repeatedly) could not be removed using 409+blade, as suggested. Instead Cerama Brite+pads cleaned everything up and made my cooktop look like new. You don't really need the scraper. You can just use carefully a replacement blade for utility knives. This set is expensive ($27, including shipping). You can buy the Cerama cleaner and 10 pads for about $15 from ACE hardware (free shipping to a local store). I have not checked extensively, but I am sure you can find these items cheaper in other webstores."
383502,2,"This product is really bad, changed the color of my feces and made my feces smells really bad, I mean really bad. Also, I followed all the instructions of use and nope, I'm not satisfied with the results.Not recommended"
32929,0,"The taste isn't intolerable, but I'd rather not drink it. Also, I had terrible cramping that kept me up all night. I will say that it did do what it was suppose to, just not as ""smooth""-ly as i thought. I bought senna in pill form for future needs."
196427,1,"I'm in the military so automatically you know that i must shave my face everyday. Also i'm black so you know that i can not use just any razor. I love this product because it is very sharp and rechargeable. I can achieve a very very close shave without razor bumps, every time. Also i can edge my hairline without the uncomfortable cord getting in my way. The combs/guards that are included are also very handy if u want a tight fade. I would recommend this product to anyone! I really mean anyone!"
407409,0,"These cleaning pads work OK, but Swiffer seems to have changed their product to a cheaper version. No longer are there ""Cleaning Cuffs To Trap Large Dirt And Hair Particles"" (as the old product description said).

234362,1,My wife is a resident in medical school. Her schedule does not always permit time to get all of her calories in. These help her maintain her weight and give her some much needed nutrition. She doesn't love the flavor but doesn't really mind it either. She compares them to runny pudding.
54238,0,"Pro: These toothbrush heads are a good size and they allow me to easily get to the back molars. Con: They seem to wear out fairly quickly, which could get expensive. For example- I have only had the toothbrush 2 months and have already gone through one of the replacement heads."
51205,2,"If you never use this before, imagine use a tweezer to pull hairs. The difference is this is 100 times faster but 100 times more painful because the motor driven roller has built-in mini tweezers. It is common sense. But again, if you have a hign tolerance to pain, it is cheap and can pull where it goes. I gave it three stars due to the pain to the point I quit using it at all.Also, the tweezers need to make contact with hairs to pull. So this is good for hairs longer than 2 mm."
29632,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
275558,0,"I was due for a new razor and asked my wife for one as a Christmas gift. She purchased the Norelco7180XL at Sears for about $85.00 thinking it was a good quality razor, which it is. (Still made in Holland as another reviewer wrote). It looked great, and I was excited about the water clean up feature. After an overnight charge, I gave it a test run. It was remarkably light and very quiet, it almost seemed to be running too slow to actually work, but it did a good job of removing my stubble. Just one problem - It seemed to really abrade my face, which was quite irritated afterwards. I do have sensitive skin, which is why I don't use a standard razor, but I never had this problem with the Braun, or the Remington razors I owned previously.It states in the users manual that it may take a few weeks to get used to Norelco's patented lift & cut system, but I don't think I would ever get used to the irritation this razor caused. Call me a pansy, but I had to return the razor, and am now in search of a new Braun model with better ergonomics, and a smooth, painless shave. Just wanted to submit this review as a heads up to anyone else who is contemplating this razor, and has sensitive skin."

395942,1,"Product works great! I have been using it for a month and I've seen significant difference in my skin, nails, and hair. Being that I am a black woman I have tons of products at home that don't do what they claim, so it is quite refreshing to finally find a product that not only is good for my health but also will aid in my hair growth, limit hair shedding, provide me with bright clear skin, and strengthen my nail growth. All in all, this is definitely a keeper!"

54662,1,I bought these for our trip to Europe last October and have to say these Socks are great. I wore them for 12+ hours and they felt comfortable and kept my legs from swelling and hurting. :-)
196075,2,The product is a worthless piece of junk. I'd give it a zero if I could. It only works half the time and when it does work it's almost useless.
3148,0,"I ordered a bunch of things off of amazon one morning. (video games, a mouthguard, this etc.) I must say this was the first to arrive. by a few days. They came in an inconspicuous bag and inside that bag was a clear bag that had them in it. I ordered twelve.First off, too small girth wise. I'm not a giant, just an average 6 foot tall guy. I'm a runner so i'm skinny, not huge like some people. So putting these on shouldn't have been a problem. It was. It was hard to roll down and just a bit lubricated. They have a pink tint to them but no one's looking so who cares.They weren't like putting on an extra small t shirt or anything uncomfortable, just a little tighter if that's what you're wanting.Overall great price for good condoms. Eventually I tried some trojan exctasy and they were much better."

348653,2,"I keep taking this stuff when I get sick, hoping it will do some good, along with Astragulus, Echinacea, Vitamin C, Oregano, etc. and it still takes me days and days to recover from most illnesses.I suspect most of these supposed cold remedies do absolutely nothing, but I take 'em anyway just in case they might help.For me this is no miracle cure. Good luck with your cold."
44288,0,"I debated between giving this product three or four stars, but I decided to go with three so it's right in the middle. They do work, but almost too well. It says to take one for relaxation and two or three to sleep, but I just took one and after about twenty minutes my eyes got really heavy and fell asleep almost instantly. I wanted them for the anxiety purpose too so I thought that wasn't too great, but at least I was going to be able to sleep for the night. I was dead asleep for about twelves hours! And so groggy the next day. So they worked, but maybe too strong for me. Maybe I should cut them in half? I do love herbal products and homeopathy, and I've been trying to find the best procuts for me, but I'm a bit on the fence with this one."
398264,0,"My husband and I had been trying to conceive naturally for several months when we were disappointed by this test. Maybe I really was pregnant ( I tested starting 4 days early and got two positive results, then two days early and another positive). We were ecstatic. Then the day of my expected period came and I tested from another brand (having used all 3 of these). It was negative. The next day, my period started. It wasn't even technically late. Miscarriage or inaccurate tests - we will never know for sure, but this month I am waiting for a missed period before I test. The heartache of a ""teaser positive"" is just more than we should have to deal with. Early pregnancy tests are less accurate (the box says so) but it seems to be concerned primarily with false negatives and not the emotional trauma of a false positive."
427761,0,"Overall, I like the taste of these bars, but they're a little too mealy for my liking. I could taste the berries just fine, but the whole grains were almost overpowering the first time I bit into one of these bars.I'd much rather eat a Clif's bar, I think. They have a more subtle flavor and aren't quite as mealy."

196613,0,"These batteries worked fine but are grossly overrated. I got an expensive charger that tells you a battery's actual mAh by fully discharging them, then records how much mAh each take to charge. None of them exceeded 1700 mAh. They're no where near what they're rated, false advertising. They must figure few have the equipment to test them and even fewer will waste the their time and money by complaining and mailing them back. I'm not sure if this an industry practice or just used by discount brands such as Power2000. I'd be curious to compare them to Maha batteries."
147597,1,"These bars make a great snack or a light breakfast. They're also the perfect travel food. The big question is, do they taste good? The flavors of Zone bars range from super tasty (strawberry yogurt and chocolate caramel cluster) to absolutely vile (blueberry yogurt and lemon yogurt). There seems to be no rhyme or reason to which ones taste good--you'd think that since I liked one fruit & yogurt flavor, the others would be similar. Nope. The same can be said for the chocoalte flavors, the chocolate caramel cluster tastes like a Whatchamacallit bar, while the chocolate mint tastes artificial and strange. I'm sure it's matter of personal taste, but having tried a sampler pack, I also recommend the chocolate vanilla cream. Overall, great product, if you get the &quot;good&quot; flavors."
276866,0,"This is a good tasting quality protein powder. The thing I wasn't anticipating, and this may be true of all such powders, was the high amount of calories and cholesterol. While I may find that such a product doesn't exist - when my supply of BSN Syntha-6 runs out I'm going to look for a lower calorie protein powder. I want to use the product to build muscle, not to gain weight."
21607,0,"My daughter has special needs and cannot hold a bottle. This worked great to hold the bottle at mouth-level for her, and she can drink from it whenever she wants.Unfortunately, the first one I bought broke after only using it 3 times, if you twist the 'locking' mechanism on the bottom too hard you can snap the plastic bits holding it together rather easily.I bought a second one (that's how good this is, it really is!) and within a few months of use the velcro that holds the bottle in the holder has ripped apart, but I was able to repair it myself to continue using it.So, it's a great product, just be careful with it, it's not meant to withstand a great deal of wear and tear."

BUYER BEWARE!I attempted to buy this product from Bargain OTC, but they completely canceled my order with out any reason given. When I inquired and respectfully stated my dissatisfaction for the situation and threatened to never do business with them again, the ""president"", Bryson Burkholder, replied with a nasty e-mail. He called me ""slanderous"" and accused me of ""trying to capitalize on and not someone who was trying to establish a long term business relationship."" I was attempting to buy their product... How else do you establish business relationships?He also said, ""People like you who threaten small businesses is why our country and economy are in such peril today.""So, if you don't want your orders randomly cancelled without explanation, or want to be accused of the country's problems... Don't buy from Bargain OTC. They obviously don't believe in the saying, ""The customer is always right!"""

269238,0,"I was very happy with the sleep mask initially. I only had one issue: since I have a head on the smaller side, the strap was a bit too loose. The way the velcro is situated made it hard to tighten, but I got it to work good enough.A few months into use, the strap got looser and looser and looser. At this point, with the velcro attached at the loosest position, there is at least a fist-sized space between the strap and my head. My fiance likes to joke about my tiny head, but it really is NOT that much smaller than the average person's head. So this seems like a problem with the product."
87595,0,"The tabletop is a good side and it's nice having the tilt and pretty easy to raise up and down but I never could make use of the tilt because there was nothing to keep anything from sliding off when in tilt mode. Also, I found the casters do not to roll well at all. They have to be in the exact straight position to roll. If they are turned at all, it locks up and causes the table not to roll. My husband said he thinks it had some adjustment to a nut that could possibly have helped but it's in such an awkward place to try to get to do it, he never did attempt it because he didn't have a tool to handle it. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy this table.

It is easier to store and smaller than the other too. I haven't had it long enough to comment on the mildew comments others have left, but I plan on washing it in the machine every once in awhile.

407137,0,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way. I wish I'd just gone to my local CVS and got the Futuro to begin with because thats what I use now. I can't for the life of me find it online, but this blog has a photo of it. [...]"
298955,0,The glasses were reasonably priced and it is hard to get this strength reading glasses over the counter. The only downside is the size of the glasses.

I am not sorry that I got the glasses but I certainly wish they were bigger so I wasn't looking over the top of them.
218663,0,"I love that Green Forest tissues are recycled and that they are reasonably soft. That combination in and of itself is apparently a miracle, because none of the other three or so kinds of recycled tissues I tried were tolerably soft.BUT I still felt guilty about using Green Forest tissues because of the packaging. For one thing, the boxes are small, like the Kleenex boxes kids used to take to school when they were required to contribute to the supply. Small boxes result in more surface area and, therefore, more packaging. For another thing, there is a sheet of unrecyclable plastic in the hole at the top of the box that dispenses the tissues, just like you'd find in the aforementioned Kleenex boxes.After going through a case of the Green Forest tissues, I figured it would actually be better for the planet if we just got big boxes of Puffs with no plastic. If Green Forest offered similar boxes, I'd seek those out instead."
319641,2,"Incredibly rich and tasty! Lists lots of protein, so that's good. But, watch out for sugar overload! Why it has to contain so many grams of sugar -- for a health bar -- is beyond me. 26 grams of sugar in the Apple Crisp! OMdiabetes! To my knowledge, all the Colossal protein bars have extremely high sugar levels. The wrapper is super noisy; try handling one in the quietness of your home without waking up or disturbing someone...forget it. Again, on the plus side the bar is really tasty and alleges high protein; on the down side, sugar quantity is sky high and the wrapper is really noisy."

289348,0,"I chose to use cloth diapers for environmental reasons, mostly, but I was looking for something that was as easy to use as disposables, and ended up buying Kushies before my baby was born. My little one is six months old today. The way I see it this is a great diaper, but there are a few things you should know before buying:1. They are bulky, and will look big on your baby's bum, especially while the baby is on the lower side of the indicated weight range of 10-22 pounds. In fact, we found them to be so bulky we chose to delay using them until he gained some more weight. I'm afraid I never bought the newborn-size version of this product (He already weighed over 8 pounds at birth) so I cannot say if they would have worked. I settled for a combination of disposables and pre-folds until he reached about 14 pounds.2. They take a long time to air-dry. If you live in a humid area and/or do not have a dryer, you will need to buy a large number of diapers to get by while you wait for the next batch to dry. Even in a dryer, you will have to run them for a little over one cycle to really get them dry.3. Will not work overnight with a heavy wetter. Yes, I know, they say you can use a liner overnight. Maybe I just have a very heavy wetter on my hands here, but I have conceded to using a disposable at night-time, otherwise I have to wake up for a diaper change.Those things considered, I still like these diapers for the following reasons:1. Very absorbent. (Daytime use, with a liner)2. Almost no leaks. In fact, I found I had more leaks when using disposables.3. Very durable.4. Easy to clean - make sure you wash according to instructions - fold up the velcro straps or they will tangle up in the washer.4. As simple and easy to use as a disposable5. Good value - again, compare to the cost of disposablesI recommend buying 15 diapers to start, then buy extra ones if you feel you need more. You will need a good washer and preferably a dryer. I would also recommend some sort of cloth liners - I use folded, plain flat diapers for that purpose. Don't give up if you get some leaks at first - it takes a couple of days' practice."

40606,0,"(I purchased this product at my local grocery store, not here on Amazon if that matters at all.)Aw, I feel bad that so many people have had a bad experience with this stuff as I've had good luck with it so far! I've run a few loads now with this detergent and it seems to be working well for our household. I do rinse the dishes before loading them, but I don't do any crazy scrubbing unless there is some stuck-on or baked-on food that I know needs to be removed via hand washing. I also use plain white vinegar as a rinse aid, so perhaps that helps as well.I have seen some reviewers comment about the possibility of water type (hard water, well water, etc.) having an impact on this product's effectiveness, so maybe they're on to something. I live in a northern US coastal state with public water supply, so if you're in a similar environment maybe give it a try and see how you fare.To be fair, it does say right on the bottle that you should scrub any stubborn food residue before loading the dishes. Also, make sure that you're not overloading the machine, and that you're leaving adequate space between the dishes so that the soap and water can work properly. Rinsing your dishes briefly before you load the dishwasher is kind of a good idea regardless of which detergent you use just as a means of preventing plumbing issues with your machine."

204514,0,"We've used this product for about 9 months. Overall, it's pretty good. The sound quality isn't fantastic - but hey, it's a noisemaker not an orchestra. We've definately gotten our use out of it, and it's worked great... unitl about a month ago.There's a short circuit in the volume knob that causes the sound to crackle and sometimes cut out completely. You have to play with the control - push it, twist it, shimmy it - to get the sound back on.This sound machine has been pampered. It's sat on a shelf and been turned on every evening, turned off every morning. It's never been dropped or otherwise abused. So, needless to say, we were disappointed to see it cut out after only 8 months. From the other reviews, we're not the only ones with the problem.The reason we gave it 3 stars is because we have used and benefited from this product for a fairly long time - so I can't complain too much for a $20 product.Enjoy!"

24094,0,"The soap formulation itself works well, like several other 3-5% sulfur soaps I tried over the course of several months. It has a 3% sulfur concentration so it's on the milder end. The sulfur smell isn't too bad--you'll smell it, but it isn't as overpowering as some topical sulfur creams. However, the bar itself has a wide and thin shape, which meant that it wore down to a sliver more quickly than the other bars I tried. Consequently, I'd recommend a more compact-shaped 3% sulfur bar or, if your skin can tolerate 5% sulfur, the Derma Klear bar."

272059,0,"The main reason for purchasing this machine was because I have lots of tile in my home and I was tired of the grout looking dingy.The concept of this machine is quite good. The problems I have with it are the corners and edges do not get clean, and the grout between the tiles is still left dirty. This machine is good for in between cleanings of your floor.The brushes could use to be a little harder to get the tough spots. You either have to run the machine over the spot over and over again or get down and clean the tough spots before you go over it with the Hoover.I would buy this machine as an in between cleaning machine, but not as my primary way of keeping my tile floors clean. I do not have any wood floors, but I would imagine it would work better on those because they are completely flat and have no grout."

179728,0,"After a great experience with Wellgate's wrist support, I went for this ankle support while recovering from a bad sprain. Unfortunately, Wellgate doesn't seem to have spent as much time/thought on this particular support. It is reasonably unobtrusive and fits well inside even narrow shoes (still allows me to wear normal footwear and even business flats/heels as necessary), but I find it quite uncomfortable after several hours of wear. I have quite small and narrow feet, and yet this support seems very small and tight after several hours. There is some synthetic stitching on the edges that rubs against the top of my foot and really irritates the skin after extended wear. Finally, it seems to squash the foot in a way that causes ball of foot pain if used for an extended period. My ankle has healed now, but if I ever need an ankle support again, I'm probably going back to the old basic kind that looks similar to a tube sock and is much softer/less irritating to the skin (although quite unattractive)."

125841,0,"So I've had this charger for about 2 weeks using it here in Australia (100-240v psu with an adaptor). PSU is rated at 3V 3A. It is not a bad charger, I have yet to test the included batteries and accessories to see if they actually work as advertised.First the good...I put in a number of different AA and AAA cells. So far all my cells seem to test below par. My 900mah AAA cells returning only about 500mah, good ol' chinese cells. I had a pair of 650mah cells which indicated about 500mah as well.The UI is actually pretty easy to use and after a short review of the included manual I was able to understand how to setup each battery to be charged the way I wanted.The bad...I'm a bit apparensive about putting in some 'good cells' like my powerex batteries to which I have a maha 401 charger for. The reason being, already in the short time I have had one battery 'explode' of sorts. I had left it overnight charging at just 200mA in the test mode to ascertain the cell's capacity. It was marked 2600mah but knowing it to be a dodgy bunch of cells (other same 'polar power' 2600mAh cells returned values between 1Ah to 2.01Ah) this one was indicating a capacity of 976mAh before I went to bed, and when I awoke the cell had burst and the foil wrapper had suffered blistering and heat damage which had in turn partially melted the charger walls of that node.I should note the cell in question has been used for roughly a year with a bunch of about 12 polarpower cells I use in my nikon flashes. On previous occasions it had been charged in a dumb charger (at 120mAh) or the maha charger without incident, even if left in the dumb charger for 48 hours. This leads me to be very cautious about the charger's cut out protection, given I was using the 200mA/100mA charge/discharge setting which is supposedly fairly safe and the cell itself had only been in there for less than 24 hours in the test phase. There have been reports that high capacity cells need higher currents to trigger the cut off, but considering this '2600mah' cell was actually considered by the charger as only a 976mah cell, then the charger should have cut off earlier or undercharged.Now I watch the charger carefully to see how many hours a cell has been charged and manually pull it out before it is finished if I think it's been in there too long.I have also tried the refresh function on 3 x AAA cells that were rated at 900mah but one day decided not to work after being in the maha charger. The cells still register a voltage but the charger has failed to refresh them, their capacities remaining at 0,0 and 1mah! So far then I have yet to 'revive' a cell successfully using the refresh function.Conclusion is, the quality of the cell plays a large role in the outcome. I think this charger really dislikes average cells so if you have a bunch of ebay knock off cells, be prepared that they might just blow up. I think this is a real shortcoming of the charger as the whole point of an 'intelligent' charger is that it should know when a cell isn't that great and charge accordingly. If you have dodgy cells I would probably recommend the maha 9000 instead as the reviews suggest it is a little 'smarter' with such cells and not prone to blowing them up! Even though the UI doesn't look as easy to use."
120121,1,"I got into a car accident 4 years ago, so I would get really sored and/or get bad back pains whenever I sit in a seat with bad/no back support for a long time. When I started my new job 5 months ago I immediately went out and search for a back support for my chair because I basically have to sit in it for almost 6 hours a day, 6 days a week. I wanted something affordable, firm, and the perfect shape to fit my back so it would be comfortable to use all day, everyday. And, this Duro-Med back support met all of my criteria! For less than $20, this back support not only looks nice, it fits perfectly and so comfortably with your back that you might forget it's there. I don't know why so many people complained about the firmness, the firmness is perfect enough to help you sit up straight and it doesn't make you feel like you're sitting up against a cement wall. I love everything about this product and I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn how to sit up straight and anyone who gets back sores after sitting down for too long!"
292166,0,"First note: the ""scoop"" used to measure servings was at the very bottom of the bottle under 11-1/2 inches of powder. If you don't want to dig it out, it is 1/2 cup when filled to the line.The product tastes OK, with a strong vanilla flavor but a bit of bitterness also.From the label, I found that a ""serving"" of one scoop (1/2 cup) produces 25 grams of protein. The bottle contains 68 such servings, so the cost is a little over 55 cents per serving. Each serving also contains 21% of the maximum daily recommended cholesterol.Just for fun, I compared this to a box of ""Great Choice"" (WalMart store brand) nonfat dry milk. I bought a 25.6 ounce box for less than $3. Adjusting the serving size to result in 24 grams of protein, I found that the powdered milk produced the same protein amount for less than 30 cents per serving. In addition, the total cholesterol for this amount was only 3% of the maximum daily recommendation.Before I reorder this product, I think I'll try the powdered milk with a bit of vanilla flavoring...."
112227,0,"The Balance chocolate brownie bar with almonds was not the best tasting product out there on the market today. It was heavy and somewhat filling, but very thick, dense, and tasted bland. It really left something to be desired. It was chewy like a brownie and it sort of resembled a brownie, but upon biting into the bar, you just know it's not a brownie. After the first bite, it was kind of hard to eat. It reminded me of these terrible diet cookies that tasted as though they were filled with sawdust. It really needs more taste. Overall, I rated the brownie bar as three stars because I suppose that taste versus nutrition is a tradeoff."
140575,0,"This is a good BP Monitor. The cuff has a piece of metal in that goes aroud your arm but it is hard to tighten the cuff. It is also expensive (I paid $73.27 at Amazon! about a month ago) as you can find a similar one (Microlife Deluxe Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor) at Costco which also has the computer software, works for 2 people and has a cuff caddy built in and is only $29.95."

I bought them to replace the insoles in my biking shoes and my foot fell asleep shortly after I put my shoes on. I tried to complete a ride with them but after 45 mins my foot was still tingling. I then moved them to my running shoes and the same thing happened. They are just too thick for me. They would probably work really well in a work boot where you had more room. I am ordering some hiking boots in the next few weeks. I will try them out in those and revise my review if needed."
238430,0,"Go to the Austrailian Dream website and get your two free samples before spending money on this. I got my samples in about three days. I tried it and it seemed to help my knees a little for a couple of hours, but the pain came back too soon for me to spend the kind of money they want for this stuff. I give them three stars because of their willingness to share their product for free before selling it to me. Try it out for yourself--for free. It might work for you. You've got nothing to lose."
283693,0,"I bought this to increase milk supply (breasfeeding). It was cheap, and it came quickly- so no complaints there. It worked well too, BUT the baby gets diarrhea from it. I looked it up online, and yes, that can be a side effect. I can't remember what catagory spacificly that it was in, but I think it was peanuts, and also a high allergy food. So hopefully it will work better for other people... I just have to try other things I guess."
396399,0,product was smaller than expected but well worth the price paid. Also it arrived faster than expected.

195163,0,"I gave this product a neutral 3 star rating because I'm not sure exactly if it works for the intended cause. You must be aware that if you have any sort of ear problem or the ear is already infected, that this product will not help, and does a poor job of adequately warning consumers. I used it and after just a drop or two I was in excruciating pain, so do not use this if there's even a possibility the ear is infected, or if you have a history of ear problems, they will only be heightened."

369371,0,"I bought this exerciser because I'm having knee problems and can't walk long distances anymore, but I don't want to become sedentary and gain weight. Unfortunately, even at the tightest tension, it's not enough to break a sweat even after 20 minutes. And at the highest tension, the pedaling tends to become a little jerky unless you're careful. I bought some ankle weights and that seemed to help somewhat, but it still took about 15 minutes to start sweating even a little and that was probably only because I started pumping my arms too. I will continue using it, but it will have to be a back-up form of exercise rather than primary, and it'll have to be supplemented with the ankle weights and probably also some dumbbells. On the plus side, it's very lightweight and stores like a dream. In answer to the comments about it getting hot, it does, but you just have to be aware and pick it up from the legs rather than in the middle. This exerciser has its place, but if you want to burn serious calories, it's not for you."

295128,0,"Pros: quite portable when in closed position, good water pressure, comfortable jet nozzle, fast pulsations, easy to grip, not too noisy.Cons: only 40 seconds or less of water per tankful, granted, this is a portable device, but not enough for a full mouth cleaning (will have to refill 1 or 2 times); battery life is mediocre (manual says 20 minutes, but I find that pressure diminishes after 15 minutes of run time); cannot use any fluoride rinse liquids with this - only water is allowed.To correct some other review regarding the run time - the 20 minutes it reports is for battery life, not water capacity. Water capacity is 165mL (approx. 40 seconds worth with new batteries) as per the manual.It doesn't come close to the larger counter-top devices in practicality, but for something to throw in a suitcase, it fits the bill."
357931,1,"I've only had the clipper for about two months, but for the few times it's been used, it has worked extremely well.The clipper is pretty quiet and does a great job cutting my hair and not pulling it like many of the cheaper clippers do.I can't give it five stars though because of the quality and length of the combs, I really think the smallest size is inadequate and not short enough. I read the reviews and found that I wasn't the only person who thought this. From another review, I found the extra available attachments from Oster and I recommend them as well:[...]The extra combs don't go on as easily, since they're spring-loaded and considered universal combs, but once they're on the clipper, they work fine. It was a bit of an inconvenience having to buy extra combs just to cut my hair short enough, considering that the extra combs are $16.50 plus shipping, and since I only needed the two smallest sizes out of the 10 that came.Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and don't regret my purchase one bit. I was considering a Wahl instead of this clipper, but after reading almost all the reviews for every Wahl clipper at this price range, I'm glad I chose this one."

207583,0,"I'm in my first trimester of pregnancy, and I've been having a lot of problems with morning sickness (nausea, not vomiting, that lasts all day long). So, I bought this and SeaBands bracelets to try, because I've used the bracelets for motion sickness before. I've been using them separately.This gum is okay. I'd say it cuts my nausea in half, at best. Which is not to say that I only have nausea half the time, just that if I'm really feeling VERY sick, sometimes I chew this and it makes me feel only pretty sick instead of VERY sick. Usually it only reduces my nausea about 20-30%. One time I had a meeting at work, and by the time I left my meeting I was SURE I was going to vomit in the parking lot because I was feeling SO SO sick morning. I had some of this in my purse and I started to chew it, and when it lost its flavor I chewed another piece, and after that I felt like I could probably drive home (8 minute drive), instead of feeling like I'd better stay bent over by the bushes. So, I was grateful that I had it with me then.I find the flavor pretty strong at the beginning, but it only lasts 5-10 minutes. The pieces are quite small. My husband doesn't want me to drink ginger ale because of all of the artificial ingredients and corn syrup, etc, so this seems to accomplish that purpose, I guess. I also bought actual ginger root and I boiled some of it to make a sort of tea, but it was so disgusting I couldn't really drink it. The gum is tolerable.I'd say if you're struggling with nausea, it's worth giving this a try. I can see a noticeable benefit from it, and it seems like there is a good chance that it would work better for some other people."

344615,0,"I purchased this for my 3.5 year old daughter who has Sensory Processing Disorder after her Occupational Therapist recommended this. She recommended the red, like the kind she uses in my daughter's therapy. I got this in and it is more of a neon red-orange color, not at all like the kind we are used to by the same maker. This inconsistency caused confusion with my daughter, and she at first refused to use it since it was not red like her OT's. I have since gotten her to use it, but she still comments that it is not red. LOL!"
247293,0,"Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars. Remember that three stars means it just okay, I am not hammering this product as I am sure some people will very much so enjoy it. If you are taking it for health purposes than I am sure you won't mind the taste at all as it is great tasting for medicine."

84279,0,"I got this product through a recommendation from my brother. It had worked wonders for him. Now as I have extremely sensitive skin, i had never had bumps on my face until I used a razor, rather than the typical shave I get when I go get a haircut at the barber. This started the bumps problem. However, my brother has always had bumps, barbershop or not and this fixed it all.When I got around to trying it, it worked for a while and then stopped. I guess my skin got used to it and it wasn't as effective. It works for a bit but not as much as it should really and I'm sure the results will vary based on who is using it. My brother and I are both black, and so I again it will vary depending on the person.Thanks for reading!"

93693,0,I do not understand why everyone is getting mad at how much they get. It specifically says ONE PACK of SIX FLINTS in the name of the product. This review is to tell people that they only get SIX FLINTS when they order this. I have not received this yet since i just recently ordered it. I write this because the 1 star reviews got me nervous about purchasing but I noticed the problem was that other people misread and only looked at the picture. Hope this review helped future purchases. I rate this 3 stars because i have not received it yet but looking forward to get this.

362186,0,"This product starts out on a bad note when you open the box. No batteries. The first thing you have to do is find/buy some 'AAA' batteries. Not a good look.I don't really know how accurate it works. It seems to be accurate enough for home use. If it says your BP is very high I would make a trip to the doctor's office.The device is decently made. Not high quality. Decent. A lot of plastic.The real question is ""Is it worth the money?""I got this on sale for $15.00. The regular price is $40.00. If I had paid $40 I would have a lot more complaints. For $15.00? I feel I got a decent deal."

I read that some thought the massage was too loud but that isn't the case for me but it could be because I use it on a couch that absorbs some of the vibration.

244696,0,"This was my 3rd Braun shaver. It worked well for 2 1/2 year and then the rechargeable cell (accu) went bad. Now it only holds power for about 5 minutes of shaving (even after a complete discharge/charge cycle).Otherwise, this model shaved very well (not Braun's best yet) with the and Flex integral head.I replaced this model with a 6520. The 6520 has the same head/foils but is larger, with a 6W rating (compared to the 5416's 5W). The result is a faster oscillation rate on the 6520 and less propensity to bogging down on 2 day stubble (i have a hard beard). The 6520 is a bit bulkier in the hand but it works noticeably better and faster (i shaved 40% of my shaving time).While the 5416 has been a good unit (although shorter lived than what i got accustomed to with Braun shavers in the last 20 years), the 6520 outperforms it hands down.If you can find the 6520 still, it is worth the additional expense for better perfomance you will appreciate every day"
298320,0,"I purchased Thermoskin because it was thinner and less bulky under clothing than the Mueller brace I had, which I had just bought off the shelf at Walgreens for half the price of this Thermoskin. It seems to give a little less support than the Mueller but was pretty comfortable to wear all day long. However, I've worn it for a week, 5 days at work and through 2 light gym workouts (bike to strengthen knee) and the stitching on the velcro that hold the brace together is half off of one pad and coming off of the other. This does not bode well for longevity. I will have to get the sewing machine out and fix it, but for the price I'm not pleased. The Mueller may be a better daily brace. I've worn the one I have for about 5 months and it is just fine."
414882,0,"Both myself and a friend purchased the warmer. We have the same issue that the warmer does not stay at the desired setting.

171085,1,"So far, this has been the perfect electric shaver for me. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it's still not as good as a blade and it takes some persistence to really get some of the flat-lying hairs on my neck. It is definitely better than other electrics I have used, although I swore them off for poor performance and haven't used one regularly for probably 10 years.I bought this shaver since I do a fair amount of travel, and it's easier to carry on an electric with all the restrictions these days. The unit is pretty lightweight -- none of the fancy charging bases and cleaning solutions to weigh you down. The non-rigid carrying case is easy to pack in amongst other stuff.For me, the razor held a charge for about 10 days of pretty extensive use, working well for me right up to the time the battery died a quick death. A couple hours of charge and it was good to go for another 10 days or more. My first charge was done in India, and as advertised the shaver dealt well with the higher voltage electricity.If you want a good, reliable, no frills shaver, this seems like a good bet."

I didn't notice much of a change in the color of my teeth, but I've used it for only seven days. Perhaps with continued use, some whitening will occur. I prefer a gel toothpaste, so this seemed a little chalky to me. I will continue to use it to see if my teeth become whiter. If that happens then the poor taste and texture will be worth it."
67333,0,"I like the look of these studs, shiny silver and crystal. Crystal isn't fully glued in on one of them though and I worry it may fall out. Same problem with the studex onyx studs. Granted I bought them from a different store. They do stay in your ears, and don't itch though!"
12578,0,"Well, I have used this and would love to use it again, but you can barely eat dinner if you want to use it. You better have an empty stomach, which means you have to eat your last meal four hours before you use it. If you go to bed at any decent hour, this means eating by no later than 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. Or if it takes time to get home, get the kids, take the dog out and then eat dinner. You are screwed. If you do not wait four hours you will have horrible stomach cramps. I rated it three stars for ease of use or lack thereof."

The price has skyrocked up 60% in the last four months - this is ridiculous!If they don't come back to reality and drop their prices down soon I'm going to have to look for something else - Optimum Nutrition is doing a MAJOR DISSERVICE to their long-time customers."

For the price of this product, the product should be more durable."
351536,0,I see no reason why someone cannot do better. The heated crystals are held to the bottom of your foot. There are none to heat the top. The cloth seems cheap and I tore some stitches the first couple of times I put them on. I combined these with a heating pad on top and that works. Perhaps I should have restricted these to wearing in bed where covers would help keep the whole foot warm. I tried them for sitting in a recliner...and they work...sort of.

You then inflate the cuff with the bulb and then it deflates automatically and gives your pressure automatically. It also stores your reading automatically.

312376,0,It's works o.k. I didn't like the package it came in. I think something that you put so close to your body or in it should come sealed in a plastic bag.It was just open with no seal on it. So I had to sterilize it before using. The cup size is not bigger enough for heavy flow. Use only at home or on vaction. Not suitable for an American work enviroment. I only say American work enviroment because the U.S does not have public Bidets. And you have to wash this cup out before you reinsert not to metion yourself because of spilliage.

190954,0,"I have been using Ysnore nose drops now for about a month and it seems to work pretty well. It burns the back of my nose/throat something fierce though. I have to lay there and grit my teeth for about ten seconds before the pain goes away. My wife tells me that when I take it at about 11:00 P.M. I don't start snoring again until about 5:00 A.M. or later. So about a 6+ hour average of being snore free. It's better than snoring all night and I can deal with the pain for ten seconds at a time if it lets my wife and family have a good nights sleep.If I am extremely tired or have had a beer or two, I don't bother taking it. I'll snore just as loud as ever.I have tried the Snorestop pills with absolutly no results.Even with the burning, I would recommend this product to Severe Snorers."
366235,0,"It worked great when I threw out my back. I could sit at my computer much longer with the brace on. Walking was easier too. As far as ""comfort and fit to support your ACTIVE life"" well, It really depends on your idea of active life. The brace works wonders supporting your back but it shifts up and out of place when you twist or move out of an upright position. It became more cumbersome than helpful while running errands and trips to the mall. But if the brace were more flexible or had elastic sides for more mobility then it would probably lose it's great support.I would recommend this for moderate to intense pain. Great for the home or office. But I would get a more flexible support for more active activities."
306455,1,"The black is actually the x-heavy and the blue is the heavy.I have been using this type of grip for over 15 years now. Of all the types I've used this type is my favorite (hard handles with a spring as opposed to padded handles, rubber bands, or individual finger springs). Most of the other kinds are either very uncomfortable, or try to be too comfortable so that you can't feel that they are even working. The undersides of your fingers and the pad of your thumb will probably be sore when you first start using this, but that will go away. You will definitely feel it in your forearm. I recommend sanding the seams on the plastic handles for added comfort. One good exercise is to put a penny in between the handles and see how long you can go without dropping the penny. A minute is usually pretty good. Much more than that and its time to upgrade.One thing that I'm not sure of yet about these is that previous models that I've used tended to last about 6 months to a year (depending on how much you use it) and then would develop a crack just below the spring and snap. Thankfully, the coil doesn't unwind or anything. The handle just breaks off and you have to get a new one. When I could buy these in a local sporting goods store for $3, that was ok. But I hope that these last a bit longer."
7246,0,"We've owned this foot bath for well over a year. My husband bought it for me and picked it up at the Brookstone store, not online. Here's the pros and cons.Pros:-feels wonderful, soothing, and really relaxes tired feet-Heats up beautifully...it will get HOT so I turn the heat on and off occasionally.-Solid and well-made-The remote is very convenient! (They only thing the remote doesn't control is how much air flow is in water.)-Really improves my husband's recent foot aches and problems (we think plantar fasciitis). We bought this before we knew of it. He says it really helps + stretching + quality foot inserts.-Depth of foot area is fine for me (U.S. size 10 women's and my husband U.S. 11)-Well worth the money, I am worried about even trying out a spa's foot bath: who knows what diseases are in there!Cons:-With water, it is heavy and you have to be able to lift it in and out of the sink to your destination-I lightly rested my feet on top of the blue insert one day and was barely putting any weight on it and it now has a hairline crack.-Would be better with a 'foot bath' boy to lug it around for you.-I find I can only use this for 25-30 minutes max and my feet will start becoming swollen or irritated, so that's what I do. I use it for a short time, dry off, put on quality foot cream and socks, and relax!-I removed the loofah-like insert as I noticed it caught water underneath it (even when bath was empty) and created mold.TIPS:-Never think of leaving water in it for an extended period of time. I got lazy for a while and left water in there for a week or so and man did I come back to a science experiment and the smell too! This needs to be emptied after every use or at least once every 24 hours. I recommend when you're done with it, to empty, rinse, and drain immediately. Remember anywhere water is, so could mold.-Rinse out thoroughly and clean out with Softscrub with Bleach + HOT water occasionally (doesn't need it every time). Really rinse it out because the bottom has a well of somekind.-Never wear shedding socks before using this. I did that once with fluffy socks and all the little cotton bits were annoying to get out.Summary:It has pros and cons, for us we think it's worth-while for the bliss it provides. Cleaning and transporting is not fun but that could be with any foot bath. I decided not to get a cheap one as the reviews were all junky and poor. I hope it lasts a long time!**Update 5-2012**: It just died last week and became garbage. The right jet stopped working. Even though the left jet kept operating, I felt my toes getting too hot and didn't want to risk damage to my home or my body, so I threw it out. Oh well - it lasted about 4 years give or take. I will not be repurchasing it. When it was full of water it was just too heavy to lug."

I tried it out for a couple of a weeks, and I did not feel like there was a significant change in my digestive track.This product claims that by helping your digestive track, it will give your immune system a boost (this is a true), but while taking it I got the sickest I had been in the last year. No that this means the product doesn't work, I just didn't feel any major difference when I was taking it, or that helped my digestive track.I am not saying this is a bad product, but it probably will not help you very much if you have moderate to severe digestive problems."

260001,0,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way.

I like the little pockets on the sides, but going by the picture, it looks like all the compartments sit straight out/flat, but they don't. They're all slanted forward which makes it hard to hold some of the items I wanted to put in it. Also, I first tried to hang the organizer of the side of my son's crib, but the straps that are connected aren't quite long enough so I ended up needing to hang it on the wall. So with all that said though, not too bad for the price."

248501,0,"This unit does an entirely adequate job of beard trimming. The settings match up well with those from earlier units and, once set, there is no slippage from one setting to another. In my estimation, the ""turbo"" feature adds no functionality, only noise and increased battery drain. The new vacuum feature allows for the capture of only about 60-70% of the hair trimmed. A potential positive is not having to oil the blades, but only if this does not shorten product life. And as with the last trimmer I owned, the NiCad battery is not replaceable, but it should be. The battery is the size of a standard AA but it is soldered in place. Directions are given as to how to remove the battery prior to disposal, but Norelco could have gone the final step and made the battery replaceable. My old trimmer worked fine; only the battery needed replacing. But then again, I would guess that product longevity does not rise high on the list of marketing features."

Several friends tried it too and all agreed it was lame & you're better off with something less passive like massage, chiropractic, yoga, tens units, and/or exercise balls. Bottom line is you gotta get things moving and the blood flowing as much as possible for any real relief. If laying around on a piece of plastic really helped I would have invested!!!!"

15119,1,"I bought the 2.75 Strength, Tortoise Gold/Antique Gold version of these. They are my second pair of readers. The first wereMagnivision Titanium Reader, 2.75 Strength.I find no optical difference between the two. Both are clear and sharp whether reading the computer screen, reading printed material or performing small-scale tasks like cutting a pill in half or setting the thermostat. I know from having dropped the Magnivisions many times on all types of surfaces that they are very durable. These seem well-made and long-lasting as well (although I have had them for less time than the others).Appearance-wise, these are the clear winners. The Magnivisions make me look a bit like Grandpa Walton. With these, I am more Chuck Yeager. They are regular, full-size aviator-style frames like you often see as sunglasses on State Troopers.However, for comfort the Magnivisions have the advantage. These weigh 1.25 ounces. The Magnivisions are 0.65 ounces - about half! And you absolutely do notice that weight difference when you have worn each for a while. Granted, this is at least partly due to the fact that the 4Readers have a larger lens and a more robust frame and there is value in that, but the others have enough lens to do their job and, as mentioned, I can attest to their ability to take punishment. I don't mean to say that these are uncomfortable - they are not. Just that the others are *more* comfortable.Price is the last comparison, and the 4Readers win that one handily. They are about 1/4 of the cost of the Magnivisions. If you lose them or sit on them or find a way to break them, it's a lesser trauma than it would be with the $30+ Magnivisions.I have attached lanyards/croakiesEyesave Croakies & Cords - Nylon Cordto the Magnivisions. This makes them even more convenient and always close at hand, but now I look like Grandpa Walton working as a part-time librarian. I think when I'm home alone I will use the Magnivisions. When I go out, I will leave those and take these 4Readers with me so friends, family and the world at large will think I am a cool guy and will not be wondering where John-Boy is."

187618,0,"I have only found three popular low GPM showerheads - the Delta Water Amplifying, The Oxygenics, and the WaterPik EcoFlow. I have not tried the Ecoflow yet so I can only discuss the Delta vs the Oxygenics. Purchased this Oxygenics showerhead along with a Delta Water Amplifying low GPM showerhead. This showerhead is not bad but has some drawbacks. Comparing this to the Delta showerhead I would have to say overall I liked the Oxygenics a bit better. While the Delta head is much quieter than the Oxygenics (since the oxygenics uses air to create the feeling of pressure spray), the Oxygenics ""seems"" to produce more water and can rinse off quicker. The Delta has a buzzing sound to it, which while subtle, somewhat bugs me - the Oxygenics is very loud (so much so the wife was worried about damaging her hearing). While both the Oxygenics and the Delta water dropets sting a bit, the Delta droplets seem to sting a bit more (not sure why) but the Oxygenics seems to have a stronger stream. The Delta showerhead seems to take longer to rinse off soap and shampoo thereby eliminating any low GPM savings with longer showers. The Delta is a bit more ""drippy"" water while on the body while the Oxygenics is more ""misty"". My wife complained about both being far too ""misty"" further away from the showerhead (shorer than me) and unsatisfying (even with the water savings) harder to rinse and colder since water cools by the time ti gets there. The Delta spray seems to be very wide near the bottom so when warming up the shower, I need to close the shower door or I have a water puddle on my floor. No real massage effect with either showerhead (unless you consider prickly stingy water bits a massage - more like getting sandblasted). So, all in all, not very satisfying and I will continue to look for better options. I have seen the larger (four hole) version of the Delta showerhead (which got good reviews) but not sure if the buzzing or ""misty"" factors would be worse with the larger unit. If you can overlook the noise (and are relatively close to the showerhead as to avoid the mist factor) then the Oxygenics will probably be great but if you have multiple people using the shower, then you might be out of luck here."

It's a good addition to the mix because it has a ton of vitamins and helps you gain lean muscle. Protein powders and shake mixes aren't always great tasting but Muscle Milk has made some really delicious varieties recently. I've tried the chocolate and chocolate peanut butter and they were enjoyable. As a fan of all things Vanilla, I figured the Vanilla Creme Muscle Milk would be right up my alley. I was wrong. There's not much of a natural or ""creme"" taste to it at all. In fact, the Vanilla taste is almost absent it's not definitive in any way. It's not horrible but if you're looking for a traditional vanilla flavored mix, then you might want to look at another brand. The only real positive thing I can say about this product is that it works well if you're looking to mix fruit or anything else because it's flavor isn't overpowering. I doubt you would want to mix alot of fruit with a chocolate peanut butter powder!"

Its pretty scary i mean like some other persons review said you can never be so perpared so i wear the panty liner soaks it underneath like seriously its like having you period but its unexpected and so horrid. I mean if the thought of leaking dosent stop you from losing weight i dont know what will. Some people say they feel it when its coming on but i didn't until i went to the bathroom. but if you follow the insturctions that wont happen you know all things arent perfect and the weight loss is worth it you just have to be determinded and do it no more excuses for the ""treatment effects"" because there are all those itty bitty booklets to help you good luck everyone !"

184171,0,"Last fall I came down a chain of colds and irritated throats. Every time my system seemed to settle down, I woke up with a throat like sandpaper. So when I was given a choice last October to preview a new, portable salt water rinse, I gave it a shot.Right off the bat, Simply Gargle's rinse is no substitute for a proper cough drop. Since it lacks the ability to coat the throat, irritation returns within a couple hours. However, cough drops can't rinse irritants out either, and that's where these ampules came in handy.Small and light enough to be carried in a pocket, and with a sturdy vinyl construction, these ampules are nevertheless too big to carry in quantity. I found the best thing to do was simply to carry one at a time with a couple drops. At the first sign of irritation, twist off the tab, squirt it all into your mouth, and gargle for about 10 to 15 seconds at a time, for about 30 to 40 seconds. This is sufficent to clear out even a lot of crap, sustaining me for at least one hour before returning home or breaking out the cough drops.On this note, I did find it difficult at times to twist off the tabs--to the point of using scissors at least twice. It also might take a little bit of practice to get used to administering all 0.4 ounces without dribbling or gagging; if available, I would use a small cup.Finally, this stuff is throat wash, not mouth wash. But if you need to clear up your breath in a pinch, or somebody in your life is getting tired of mint-flavored kisses, these are sure better than nothing. I doubt the health benefits of any of the herbs listed in Simply Gargle's formula, but I'll take them over onion breath anyday."

I choose this one mainly because of the price but I would suggest spending a bit more money and get a higher quality product. The shaver attachment works great but the tweezer attachment does not. The results are some hair left over and short lived results. Overall I would not buy this product again.

424696,0,"Trying to lose some weight and start living a healthier lifestyle so I figured I'd start by flushing out my system. Read the reviews and product description which basically led me to believe that this product was subtle enough for me to take it every day. That was, however, not the case.First week: Began taking the product on a Friday and didn't see the results until Sunday. Sunday was not a good day. Yes I had more BMs during that day but it also felt like I had diarrhea. By that I mean there was a constant knot in my stomach and I really didn't want to risk leaving the house. Note that I never took more than 4 pills a day despite the label indicating I could go up to six pills a day. In no way am I saying that my results will be the same for you. After all, everyones' systems is different.Second week: The sensation of diarrhea didn't subside. I had to stop taking the pills because I can't afford to spend half the day at my bathroom at work. So I stopped taking the product Sunday-Thursday.I'm now in the third week or so and I do the following: I take two pills on Friday (one in the morning and one in the evening) and four pills on Saturday. I find this works better for me as I generally stay home on Sunday and I think cleaning out my system on a weekly basis is better than not doing so at all.All in all, I'd say purchase the product but don't begin use until you have a day or two set aside to test how it affects your body. This product may in fact do nothing more than give you diarrhea for a day, but here's hoping there's some sort of health benefit."
112275,0,The taste wasn't the greatest. It tends to leave an aftertaste. I found the bar to be extremely chewy but dry. I didn't notice any changes in energy levels either. The bar is ok for a quick bite when on the road with the kids to hold you over. I don't believe it's what the package says it is.

215164,0,"There is a difference between what is pictured and what was received: The picture is for the older version mop head which would fit my older style mop handle. What I got was the newest version for the latest mop handles, which snap in instead of screw in. The O'Cedar folks were of very very little help, and their video on mop head replacement is what convinced me this would be the older style mop head. Customer service explanations reminded me of something my old high school track coach loved to say when somebody didn't perform as expected and was trying to convince Coach there was a good reason: ""Excuses are like noses. Everybody's got one.""With a little modification, I was able to get this to work. All it took was to cut off the plastic tabs that snap into the new style handle, then pierce the sponge with a utility knife, and fasten it to my old style handle with the metal ""wings"" with a couple nylon bolts and wingnuts from the local hardware store.To be fair, O'Cedar, after much finagling on my part, did offer to send a gift certificate for the amount of any mop heads I returned to them. But I'm not going to do that, as I do not trust them to give to honor their word. You guys in Brooklyn I have no beef with, since you all were caught up in the middle of this, and I didn't give you a chance to take back the order since I assumed the restocking fee could not/would not be waived."

I'm not use to all that sugar.. so I doubt I'll be buying this again."
268482,1,"This product is so good. I have been using soft contact lensesfor 11 years and this is the best solution I have tried so far.After using it, lenses are cleaner than ever! They feel like I just opened them brand new from the original package. I love this solution: no stinging, no discomfort at all, lenses are super clean.This solution has to be neutralized before you put your lenses on, so you have to use the enclosed case with the neutralizing disk and wait 6 hours for your lenses to be clean and the solution neutralized before you use them again. Sometimes lenses get dirty and all they need is a fast rinse. This solution cannot be used for that. I purchased a separate simple saline solution for those specific needs. Nevertheless, my overnight cleaning solution will be Clear Care from now on! It simply works excellent."
117363,0,"I have used this product long term and find that it works pretty well, but not outstanding. If a spray product is what you are looking for, then this will fill the bill. However, if you are looking for something that is outstanding, try ""Sanderson's Throat Specific Mixture"". I know, the name sounds like a snake oil remedy, but it is phenomenal."
70231,0,"When they say ""getting started"", they really mean it. You only get enough dusting powder for one use and the lotion, oil and shampoo/wash only lasted me about three weeks.

187005,1,"I bought this for my husband and he really liked it. However, it would not hold a charge and the powerboost button did not work. We have returned it for a new one and are waiting for it to arrive. I asked if he wanted something different but he liked the way this one shaved and decide to give a new one a try.UPDATE:We received a new shaver and had exactly the same problem. It would not hold a charge. Had to send it back again and am waiting on a refund. Would not recommend this product until they get the glitch fixed. I would change my star rating but the site will not let me."
251462,0,"I decided to try out the Alli product to see what the fuss was about. I picked up a starter kit at Walfart. I had a few slices of pizza and popped a pill. Next morning I was abruptly uninterrupted at my office desk. It seems that what I thought was going to be the usual after breakfast morning toot, turned into a monster. An orangy oily liquid came abruptly out of the arse into my whitey-tightys. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this, it actually ran through my undies and past the trousers onto my white leather chair beneath. I s*** you not. I went to the bathroom to pass the rest and what remains in the bowl is little blobs of oil floating on the water, like adding oil to your noodle water, except orange and smelly. At least I know it works I quickly thought. Of course my next decision was to buy only black underwear, which for a guy is probably the best choice anyway. After that I also noticed my cheeks were very slippery like I had a bunch of lube or something between them, weird and kinda gross. But I guess thats the price to pay for getting rid of all that extra oil I didnt absorb. Cheers!"

247483,1,"I develops asthma suddenly and was put on several steroid inhalers, nose spray, zrytec, and pills for coughing, which they all sort of helped but i felt would make me sicker in the long run. I had sever itching ear canals that were driving me insane and I had crazy sneezing. My acupuncturist weened me off of all these and put me on a mix of Classical Chinese pearls and Aller-DMG. It's amazing. It made my itchy ears, sneezing, and asthma better. It's an amazing product. Today I take nothing except for the occasional Aller-DMG when my allergys get bad."
310972,2,Works good for turning vinyl looking new but supposed to clean as well? I could have rubbed with plain water and got same results as far as cleaning goes. Not worth the money if you are looking for protection and cleaning both. DH-60 is misleading cause it's not uv60 but maybe closer to UV-10 rating? I gave it below average cause it's supposed to do both clean and protect and jury still out on protect.Good luck
283404,0,"I've noticed positive changes with this, but have also experienced soooooo much nausea. Even if I take it with food it makes me nauseous. I like that its a metabolism booster, but I wish the side effects weren't so strong. I took one about 5 hours ago and I'm still feeling queezy. I'm sure One-A-Day can improve this product somehow."
186964,2,"There are few products quite as intimate as our bathroom tissue. Did Georgia Pacific really think they could trim so much from the width and nobody would notice? I assume most people are kind of like me, and have habits in the use of their product that have been pretty consistent for quite a long time. Grabbing the customary amount of tissue recently yielded an entirely unexpected and unpleasant result. Other manufacturers have narrowe to some degree as well, and I'm putting more effort into finding TP that isn't so narrow. The fixtures in our homes are specifically designed for a standard width. This is on the same level as Coca Cola messing around with the formula for Coke."
176402,0,"This product is effective, but the taste is so horrible that I threw it all out. It is worth stating, I can endure nearly any taste if I feel I have a reason to, and with the expense of this product and two full trays... I had a reason to. Unfortunately, I found that I could not bring myself to chew this for the full five minutes recommended, since the taste got more and more bitter with every chew. Considering the many other options I have for caffeine (including Jolt Gum which is entirely palatable), I will not be buying this again."
210076,0,"My favorite tweezers bit the dust a few months ago. This one had terrific reviews on Amazon, so I bought it. I don't understand all of the enthusiasm. Most of the time, they perform okay. But sometimes they don't. Hairs break off, and sometimes they slip out. Perhaps I received a dysfunctional pair. If I'd paid $8 for them, I wouldn't be so critical. But at this price, I expected more."
422771,0,"Bought these once directly from the company. Then, bought 3 more bottles through Amazon because with Amazon you got free shipping.

268125,2,"I have arbitrarily chosen the conditioner, but the following applies to EVERY SINGLE product in this company line.It's commonly known fact that most of the cosmetic companies claiming to be organic actually are NOT (such as Nature's Gate, Kiss My Face, Dessert Essence, Jason, etc.).The reason Avalon (NON)""Organic"" is the worst offender in my eyes is1. the fact that they actually have the audacity to use the word in their name, while their products still contain synthetic, and potentially carcinogen ingredients and2. I have gotten duped by them in the past and spent a lot of money on their products before realizing how blatantly dishonest their marketing tactics were.It used to be even worse in the past when they first showed up on the market.Enticed by the name, I happily jumped on the bandwagon and kept buying their shampoos, conditioners and lotions (foolishly without reading the Ingredient label), only to find out A LOT later that they all were laden with all kinds of harmful chemicals, there was just had some ""natural stuff' thrown on top so it sounded more enticing (and misleading).Even though recently they have 'cleaned their act' significantly, and they now claim ""70% of ingredients are organic""... where does it leave the remaining 30%?(these ingredients, among others, are still questionable: Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Coumarin, Limonene, Linalool and little less so Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Stearyl Alcohol).I have stopped buying this line long time ago, even though the overall quality MIGHT BE higher than other commercial brands. Such level of dishonesty in business practice is completely unacceptable to me.PS For those doubting what I just wrote or not familiar with the facts, pls. do search on ""Organic Fraud in Cosmetics"" or similar topic. You will be surprised with the results.Here is just one example (taken from [...](Quote):""Such brands as Avalon Organics, Nature's Gate and Giovanni make organic claims on products whose main cleansing and moisturizing ingredients are generally made without any organic material whatsoever and are usually composed in significant part from petrochemicals."""

I started using this product a few weeks ago and, like magic, the problem is 95% resolved. Now I've also done a lot of ergonomic changes to my keyboard/mouse styles, but the sudden difference after starting to use this wrist support was just awesome.It feels a bit weird wearing something like that at first but you do have full finger control and it's worth it for not waking up all numb!"

I give it only 3 stars because if I take 10 readings one after another I get 10 different results. Not sure if this is normal or not but this seems odd to me even though the results are not too far apart.The device itself is easy to use and setup just read the instructions first as the proper holding and posture is crucial for a good reading.
183524,0,This product works as intended but you cannot hang many brooms/mops because the weight will pull it off the wall. We had to glue it to the wall because the stickers could not hold it. The holes are also smaller than some of our brooms/mops so make sure your handles are thin before ordering!

Also, the cover is white, which starts to look dirty quickly.Still, it is reasonalby priced and doesn't take too long to heat up in the microwave. I also like that it is odorless, since I find the smell from scented heating pads too intense."

I would use this over other products but wish they could come up with something better after all these years. Tip: I use a floss pick, you can buy a bag of 100 for a couple of dollars anywhere. I gently scrape along my gums and this stuff comes off easily, than I brush my gums with toothpaste. Works great."

139328,0,I guess the under $5.00 price should have told me that it wouldn't be a good replacement for the mustache comb that I had.

343880,0,I bought this belt for my wife who has terrible back pain. She doesn't get any relief wearing it when she is inactive such as reading/watching TV or engaged in mild activity such as preparing dinner or light housework. But she gets some mild relief (20%) when she is more active such as puttering with her flower garden for a longer period of time. This item was highly recommended by her physical therapist who also has a very bad back and gets a lot of relief when wearing this belt. The therapist said it improved her life substantially. The belt is not that expensive so I would try it. You won't know if it works until you wear it. Everyone is different so you just can't assume if it doesn't work for one person it won't work for you. Good luck.
255750,0,"It is easy to setup; takes in a number of variables and uses them to output a value after the measurement.Getting these variables right has a big impact on the fat % that comes out. I wonder about this. If I enter a different weight or gender, the scan gives me a different fat %. I guess I expected it to not need other inputs besides just the reading itself. Other factors affect the number too: time of day; if you've visited the toilet; the way you hold it; and proximity to your last feeding (should be 2 hours since last feeding). So it has to be done at the same time of day.If used in a consistent way, and as instructed - the directions that come with it are great - I believe one could get an accurate sense of where their fat % is headed. Like weighing yourself, it's one of those things best measured on a weekly or monthly basis instead of daily.I was curious if I would be able to ""feel"" it taking a reading. You can't. But don't use if you have a pacemaker, it says. So it must be pushing some small current.I have not tried using calipers, but that would be my next thing to try if I explore this again."

242648,0,"Eucerin Aquaphor Healing Ointment comes in a fairly large, reasonably priced tub. The manufacturer states that it is free of fragrance and preservatives, and is therefore hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic. These are two very important considerations for those of us with sensitive/irritated skin,of course. The manufacturer further states that the ointment is able to absorb three times its weight in water, and is recommended by pediatricians and dermatologists. My dermatologist recommended it to me for my constantly dry, cracking hands.The product is, of course, for external use only, and should be kept away from the eyes. It shouldn't be used on animal bites, serious burns, or deep puncture wounds. It will temporarily protect minor cuts, scrapes and burns, and chapped or cracked skin; and is useful in protecting skin from the drying effects of windy or cold weather. It's also, of course, a useful product for baby/toddler care.One important reason I need a rich ointment for my skin is that I find myself, pretty much on a daily basis, using disinfectant sheets on my cats' litter box; the sheets help keep the litter box bearable. But they are murder on the skin, and I've been instructed by my dermatologist to wash hands immediately after using a sheet and apply ointment. I did, however, have a problem with this ointment: it is 41% petrolatum (popularly known as Vaseline), and is awfully thick, greasy and sticky for use in the middle of the day. My dermatologist did, in fact, agree with me that this ointment is too sticky for use during a working day. I've another problem with this product: it is reasonably inexpensively priced, but is, in fact, largely petrolatum and mineral oil, and they are two of the cheapest substances available. I'm no chemist, it might be difficult to combine those two substances, the word ""emulsion"" rings in my head. But it seems to me Aquaphor might be even more reasonably priced considering its ingredients."

If this is true, they certainly made a drastic mistake by discontinuing their most successful and well-liked product."

269681,0,I have used three different types of allergy meds to relieve my dogs itching issues. I tried benadryl which did nothing and Chlorpheniramine which helped but not extremely effective. Clemastine seems to work the best but it definately doesn't completely stop this itching. This product works well enough that we will continue to use it during the cooler months since that seems to be his allergy season. I do recommend trying it on your dog. It may not stop the problem but it reduced it to a more tolerable level.

I also found that the pop up feature only works with certain brands - the Costco wipes (Kirkland) are great and they will pop-up."

169446,0,"About 11 year ago I found this product and was completely blown away by it. At that time they offered three flavors, chocolate, strawberry and vanilla - and each one, when made with ice, tasted as good as any shake you could get at McDonalds. And they also had an incredible effect on weightloss - it was like I found that secret to make it truely painlees. I'm a big man - and I went from 235 to 185 in no time! Of course I worked out too. But I decided then and there that if I ever needed to lose weight again this is what I was going do.Well I had a major family crisis - a major tragedy - and about five years ago the depression caused me to eat again. This time I ballooned to 250. When I was ready to lose the weight I looked for this product again but it was nothing at all like I it used to be. They dropped the strawberry and came up with something with sucralose (older version had aspartame) - that tastes chemically and leaves an aftertaste in the mouth.I still had SOME left from way back then - and it was expired by now but I used it anyway just to see if my memory was incorrect. It wasn't. The older version tasted a thousand time better than this does.Since I bought a lot of it, and bought it over the internet I decided to try to stomach the taste. I have gotten used to it and have managed to lose 30 pounds with considerably more effort (which might be because I am older) but this is the first time the newer, supposedly improved version of a product was eight steps backward.What ever they changed - I wish they would change back."
420055,0,I found the Flicker a bit disappointing. The shape of the razor didn't allow for full use of the entire blade. This would be a good starter razor for a younger teenager. I wouldn't recommend this product nor would I purchase it.

I let you know if the other one fails as well!"
221242,0,"I walk with dumbbells (not the human version rather a short bar with weights on each end commonly associated with exercise.) Enhanced stress on musculoskeletal system (a good thing) can be symptomatic - in my case - the toes which are subject to irritation, bruising and related discomforts. Usually it is one toe. Inserting a toe cap over the inured toe protects it, permits continued activity with minimal or zero discomfort. Soon it heals and you can leave the cap at home.Foot Smart Gel Toe Cap was my first purchase. They disappeared after a few months so I bought Pedifix Visco-gel Toe Cap - to try something different and because they are less expensive. Consider Foot Smart if your toe box is sufficiently wide and high to allow plenty of room for your toes. Consider Pedifix if your toe box is narrower and shorter with little or no extra space.Why? Foot Smart is thick, dense and therefore more durable however unless you have enough room and better yet there is a space between the offending toe and its mates -you may be aware (perhaps annoyingly so) of the Foot Smart; your toes may feel tight, cramped and uncomfortable.The Pedifix is thinner and more conforming to the configuration of the toe. It is quite comfortable; you do not know it is there; it is thin enough to as not to increase the load that must be accommodated by the toe box. The down side is it is less durable and more likely to develop an opening. This happened to me but the opening is very small, has not increased in size after months of hard use and is a negligible factor in the feel and function.So it basically comes down to the relative size of your toes and toe box but I like the way the Pedifix encases the toe like a second skin; you are not aware of it and it does the job. Also less expensive. All things considered I strongly prefer Pedifix."

316715,0,"I just bought this product to try to drown out the noise of the woman who lives in the apartment above mine. All night she rolls around in her bed and the creaking of her old, cheap mattress keeps me awake. It's not from what you thinking too, she just is a big lady and heaves herself all over the bed all night. If you ever buy a co-op, be sure to find out how much insulation there is between floors! So, until the real estate market gets better and I can sell my unit I needed to give something a shot so I can get some sleep.Anyway, the machine is nice and compact. I can fit it easily on the night table and it has no lights that a unit with a digital clock would. The thing I noticed the first time I used it was that the sound loops are so short it is very annoying. The rain forest selection sounds like one bird and a cricket and that's it, and it doesn't sound like any rain forest bird either..The heartbeat is just plain spooky, all I keep thinking about is the old story of The Tell Tale Heart. I expect to hear Vincent Price to start speaking any second.The only one that I've been using is the rainfall, which is o.k. but it's all the same sound, not like a natural rain pattern.The Wind sounds like someone stood in front of a big fan and recorded it for a second. The ocean would be better if they had left out the darn seagull and had more waves crashing or something. Summer night is just a bunch of crickets, but not bad as it kind of lull's you off to sleep. If you're lucky enough to live in the country you could just leave the window open and hear the same thing. I guess if your in the country you probably wouldn't need a machine like this anyway, unless you sleep with someone who snores.I'm giving this 3 stars because of the low price and the size of the unit, also the ability to use batteries in it if you travel.You may find one sound that work as I did, so to me to get a good night sleep it's o.k. for now.There is another reviewer who also mentioned the short sound loops, and I agree 100%, but if your just looking for something economical and aren't too tuned in to the repetitive pattern of the sounds, it should be fine. I think it would be a good unit for babies and small children too, as they wouldn't be so hung up on the particulars of the looping issues."

391174,0,"Being a Designer , I am endlessly frustrated :-) . The little things that cost nothing have been left out .The basic error is that the team hasn't looked at the graph pattern length and included them next to each setting or selection (hz style and time duration) the user is offer . After using the machine for a while you get to know what style of brain entrainment we would like for a particular mood or situation (did we sleep well last night , therefore a style .....) . I know when now after using the machine after a 8 months that when I lye down I would like a certain pattern : like going down to 4 hz fast or slowly or going up into the 18 hz band to modulate my exited tempo before going into a relaxing trace etc etc . Sirius offers 24 patterns with a blurb about what they are for but none are really able to take into account how one feels at the time . Having a simple saw tooth graph showing hertz drops and time length next to each setting , with major time hz lengths written next to those periods , would allow the user to know at a glance which setting to choose . Another geek failure . But thanks for trying .So the machine sort of does the job , but it is hit and miss as to whether I have selected the right program and if not , it screws up the mission as one gets weary of the entrainment clicking and lights . A good tester if your not sure if this system will work but if you can try this out before buying and buy one that is programmable (and with colored lighting , the Sirius is monochrome ), I think you will have a more long term satisfactory experience ."

196241,2,"I was my own guinea pig in using this device. I am a 50 year old female that is 5'6"" and weigh 135 pounds. I usually will have a glass or two of wine most evenings. It was my intention on drinking a whole bottle of wine and journal the results while at home. First rattle out of the box, I blew a .02! I had not had a drink in 24 hours. I blew a second time and it said .01. I drank a glass of water and rinsed my mouth out and blew a .00, did it again and .00. At 6:00PM I had my first glass on an empty stomach. It says that you should wait 20 mins after eating or drinking anything to blow. I waited 10. At 6:50, I blew a .03, seemed reasonable. I ate dinner with my 2nd glass. At 7:30 after 2 glasses I blew .04. I then decided to blow several times to check for consistency so I will start showing the series. The series was .04, 05,.01,04,02,04. At 8:10 after 3 glasses .07, 05, 05, 06, 07. At that point I was on the bubble as to if I was driving impaired. At 9:20 after 4 glasses I was definitely drunk and knew I would be driving impaired, I blew .05, 05, 04, 05 which was definitely incorrect. At 10:45 after the final glass I blew .05, 04, .02, 05, 04. Then I checked it again at 11:30 I blew .1, .12, .06, .12. The room was spinning at that point. I went to bed. I woke up at 3:30AM and checked it again and it said .00, .00. I got out of bed at 7AM with a bit of a hangover and checked again and it was .00. I don't think that it should have registered .00 after a bottle of wine at 3:30AM but I am not an expert. It seemed on point for the first 3 glasses after the initial false positive. Then when it should have obviously read around .08 and up it was inaccurate. I will be returning the device."
409834,0,"You really can't go wrong with a multi vitamin. But for me with this multi vitamin, I have to eat much more then I normally would at breakfast to keep it down. For breakfast I will usually have a regular size bowl of cereal, or yogurt mixed with fruit or sometimes a piece of fruit with toast. But to keep this down I would have to eat a regular size bowl of cereal and two pieces of toast. That's much to filling for me to eat for breakfast. Mainly because I don't have much of an appetite in the morning, but eat to get my metabolism going!I would find myself taking them later in the day after lunch and because of the caffeine (that states it's equal to one cup of coffee) it was too much for me that late in the day and would keep me up at night. Though I believe there is a version with no caffeine. So I switched to taking B complex with vitamin C, along with a kelp, and flaxseed supplement(to improve skin).

I drink and enjoy green smoothies, so its not like I am not used to drinking green based foods in liquid form. However, this stuff is absolutely nasty tasting to the point of making you gag. I made the mistake of buying the large container figuring the bad reviews on taste were just by people not use to greens in liquid form. So if you are thinking of buying this, you SHOULD BUY THE SMALL CONTAINER to make sure you can stomach it. Or, better yet go in on a large container with a few friends--chances are one of them will not be bothered by the taste and the others can get reimbursed and let the friend who likes it keep the stuff--that way none of you will be out any money. I will be giving this stuff away--more than happy to waste the $50 and save many ""gag"" reflexes."

228374,0,"The last Futuro Thumb Stabilizer I bought had metal braces. The new version (purchased 6/30/11) has plastic braces, different (perhaps better) fabric and a tighter fit than the old style had. I'm 5'10"" with normal size hands. The S/M size is too tight to get over my thumb. I think it would take a VERY petite hand to fit that size. I just bought the L/XL size. It fits quite snugly. If you have big hands, you will definately need (at least) the XL size.I have basil arthritis in my thumb. The new brace works better than the old one. For my needs, I removed the two plastic braces (same shape and placement as the old metal ones). The cut is tight enough to provide the support I need without the braces and allows for a greater range of movement. If the plastic braces are installed, the new version is too tight on my thumb - cut off circulation kind of tight!Personally, I think the new smaller sizing could be a problem for some people. I'm hoping the new fabric will loosen up just a little as I wear the brace.Good product with poor sizing. Go to a brick & mortar store and try them on before buying online! If they fit your hand, I do recommend this brace."

187990,0,"I purchased this replacement battery pack for a Norelco 7886 XL shaver. I open the shaver by un-screw the two screws on the side-trim and on the main body. Then, a set of nickel cadmium recharhreable batteries appears inside, they are seat in a battery holder, opposite side, with one positive and one negative side stick to a metal from the inside, and the other ends are just a metal plate with springs. I used a pier to remove the battery fromthe metal strip by force. Then, curve the metal strip and put the new battery pack, which comes with 2 metal strips already back on the battery holder with the correct polarity (it fits just fine). Just make sure the new metal strips from the new batteries touch the curved old metal strips to make a connection. Then put back the cover and screw back the 2 screws. All done. After recharging, the battery and the shaver works fine again."
240131,0,"We tried this about a month ago. Worked AWESOME after about 10 days. Completely changed my almost 4 year old son. Daycare said it was like night and day. Unfortunately, It just gave me false hope. He reverted after about 8 good days at school (a total of 3 weeks or so on the liquid). Now I am trying to see if I can find something else that will work...maybe a combo...I just don't know."
335907,0,Pretty disappointed in the item description. It does not have a removable cover and does not have a strap for securing it in place. The only reason I did not return it is because I can use for my computer chair when I have sore back.
405957,0,"I thought I would try this for my anxiety issues. Ive tried it for about two weeks now and I havent felt like it has calmed me down at all. Which is kinda disappointing because I remember taking this once and it having that effect but I am not experiencing anything like that with this. Havent had a change in my diet or anything so....I'm just assume its just not the right treatment for me. But even though I didnt get the expected results I thought I would, i do notice that it makes me more alert in a way. So does something just not what I would particularly like.Probably wont repurchase for my anxiety, might use to help me study or to aid alertness."
61696,2,"so sorry that I purchased this after shave from this supplier. it is not the real thing. different color, different scent and the label didn't even fit the bottle. In the past I purchased the after shave from a supplier that I have dealt with for years, only chose this supplier as I had an amazon gift card to use. Now I have wasted my gift card and gotten something that I will have to throw away. Won't purchase anything from this supplier again. only giving it one star because I can't give it a minus"

Deep Sleep contains Valerian root, California Poppy, Passionflower, Chamomile flower, and other ingredients.Both I and my travel partner took it, and we both had nightmares.

406721,0,As a previous owner of two health food stores I would say this is an excellent product for the money. My biggest compliant however is that it uses galatin instead of veggie caps.

85278,0,"This review will compare the benefits and disadvantages of the Remington BHT-2000 and the Norelco Bodygroom for shaving the groin. I purchased the Bodygroom earlier this year and have a review of it on Amazon from around the first or second week of February.To begin, I find the Remington to be more solidly built than the Bodygroom. Plus, the Remington's smaller design makes it easier to maneuver around the groin area than the Bodygroom for trimming that area. Advantage: Remington.Secondly, I find the trimming capability of the Remington to be better than the Bodygroom. What I don't like about the Norelco is that is comes with flimsy detachable heads to use for trimming. I like how the Remington has a dial-type head (similar to what you see in most beard trimmers) in which you can choose from 5 setting for hair trimming. Advantage: RemingtonThirdly, I found the shaving capability of the Remington to be quite poor compared to the Norelco. For either unit, it is recommended to trim the hair to the lowest setting before attempting to shave using the foil head. If you don't trim the hair first to as short as possible, the shaving head on each unit will not be able to shave the hair properly. Getting back to the review...the Remington dual head shaver attachment is unsatisfactory. It does not shave as close as the Norelco foil head, nor is it as irritation free as the Norelco foil head. I used the foil head on the Remington as gently as possible on both my testicles and part of the shaft, and I felt a stinging razor burn on two separate occasions. Eee-yowch. This did not happen with the Norelco Bodygroom. Advantage: Norelco.I would recommend that if you plan to simply trim your groin area, then your best bet is to go with the Remington as it is the better trimmer. If your desire is to shave your groin area as smooth as possible with an electric instrument, than your best bet is to go with the Norelco Bodygroom as it is the better shaver. Please understand, however, that even with the Norelco being used as a shaver, you will not experience a shave as close as you would by using a blade.Based on my experience, I find trimming the groin area to be the way to go instead of shaving the area. In order to keep the groin region hair free, you would have to shave that area every day. I find I can get by with trimming that area to a very short length once a week to keep it rather well maintained."
271577,0,"I have a 2500 sq ft home that is all hard flooring. It's just less work in the long run for a good deep clean to get the commercial Rubbermaid bucket out and mop.That being said, it comes in handy for when my relatives give me an hour notice of their impending arrival. It does do the pet highway in a hurry.I don't use the soap recommended because of the expense, plus it streaks and leaves the floors sticky. I use hot water and vinegar, sorry can't tell you the percentages.I love it for my kitchen and I wished I used it everyday.It's not a massive pain to clean, but I don't like the fact it takes a least 3 times of dumping to scrub 300 sq ft.I don't use it on my laminate, because it leaves the floor too wet and I still have to dry mop. Easier to use the bucket and mop.My best friend has the same model as mine and she wouldn't live without it. She has linoleum and hardwood floors. She also uses diluted Fabuloso for her cleaning solution."

251080,0,"I have been taking alli for almost a month and have lost no weight due to this pill but what I have realized is that it has helped me to not gain weight. For the first two weeks I was doing great but then a social event came up and I splurged. I had no nasty side effects other than the normal oily stools. (I have never experienced any really nasty side effects from alli.) I gained back 3 pounds from the 6 pounds I lost the first two weeks from eating around 1500 calories a day, not from taking alli. I then got right back on the band wagon and was good for another week staying about the same weight, which is normal. I fell off after another social event and then starting eating ""real food"" not bird food for a few days and realized the alli was keeping me from putting any weight back on. I thought ""this is exactly what I need."" I had finally found the miracle pill that could help me through the harder parts of dieting, the days when you just want to eat like a normal person. I am now going to start the tracy anderson methods dvd (amazing reviews on amazon.com, oprah's show and a few other websites), madonna and gwenyth paltrow personal trainer. I am hoping with the combination of the two I can loose that last 8 lbs to fit back into my before holidays jeans :0). Good Luck to all that give it a try. Fair warning this pill will not help you loose weight but it will help you to maintain your weight easier and also make it easier to stay on track. I am in my mid 20's and only wanted to lose 15lbs to put me back at a healthy weight."

233606,0,I get allergies that make my throat sore and itchy and I had been using the Halls mentho-lyptus throat drops and while I love how strong the mentho vaper action is I don't like the strong mediciney taste that they have and those throat drops are usually recommended if you have a sore throat because of a cold or the flu but these Fruit Breezers with pectin are for relief for everyday throat irritations and yes this stuff does taste better then the menthol throat losenges I have found them to only work if my throat was mildy itchy but when my throat is very itchy these just don't work on relieving my throat. I wish that they would come out with a losenge that would be just as strong at relieving my throat irritation like the menthol losenges but taste as good as this product.

199675,1,"I have yet to get full benefit from this product....after several days of using it I became very ill. BUT--having educated myself about systemic infections because I have Lyme Disease, I recognize this as a ""Herxheimer reaction"" -- a phenomenon where a treatment helps briefly, then you actually get worse--it is because you are killing off *so much* toxic yeast in your body, it is overwhelmed. the ""herx"" and I are old buddies now.....SO for those who experience mysterious horrid symptoms a while after taking it---it most likely means it is working! (But disclaimer: please do check with your doc just in case, I am not a doctor, just informed of this common reaction). The answer is: taper back a bit on the candex, and detox your body every day--infrared saunas, epsom salt/hydrogen peroxide baths (pulls toxins out of your pores) mud wraps to name a few..you have to get rid of toxins as fast as you are killing off the candida...and any other crittters in there!"

411720,0,"These diapers have pros and cons for me. I like that the minis are small enough for a newborn, but the Fuzzibunz XS work much better as a small pocket diaper.I have been using the Minis (size xs) on my son - he is about 8lbs. The biggest con, is they leak! No matter how we fold the inserts and if we pad extra in the back or front we have leaks - I think it is because the elastics around the leg are not tight enough. When using the xsmall or minis, I really recommend snapping them up almost too tight to contain fluids. I definitely do not recommend using these at night or after a big feeding.The pros are I do like that they are easy to use and the velcro is very sturdy - they launder well and the colors are great. Also, they are made in the USA which is a big plus for me. I think they will work a little better when my son is larger. I am not totally ready to give up on them (since I made the investment), but there are far better pocket diapers out there!"

388442,0,"My first foil shaver. I last had a Norelco rotary-type, after decades of cutting myself with blades. Even after replacing the heads in the Norelco, it performed weakly, missed a lot of whiskers, too slow. The Remington is way faster and closer, but much noisier, and the battery life stinks. They claimed 50 minutes of operation, I believe. I'm lucky to get 15 minutes, 3 shaves at 5 minutes. As soon as the charge indicator reaches 60% it dies and the reserve never worked. Always keep the charging cord handy."

16193,0,This is not the best sponge but it is also not the worst sponge. It is not really soft but it isn't hard either so this is not the problem. The problem with that sponge is that the handle is too big. I used it for my back and because of the long handle it was hard to reach up where my neck is. And that handle looked cheap so I was afraid it would break but it lasted the four months I used it without breaking (i made a couple of small holes in the sponge but that was not the end of the world). I purchased three and I don't regret having two more of these sponges.
97551,0,I purchased these to help with PFemoral pain and tendonitis which I experience the most while cycling.Cant say for sure that they solve the problem. They did not 'instantly' elimininate the pain I was feeling nor does it help after a long ride.One issue is that under knee bending while cycling the strap slips down on my leg and takes the pressure off the intended spot on my PTendon. Unless they are VERY tight they will slide down.Jury is still out for me and this product.
325198,0,"Non-denatured whey is most difficult to mix. Start with 1Tbsp of water, add package and stir to make a paste. let sit for 3-5 minutes then add to your favorite beverage or water, it is best to take on empty stomach. take 2x daily. I find mixing with PLAIN yogurt works best for me. I received this item which expires in 3 months, normally this has a 18 month shelf life, so this has been sitting around who knows where... I would have liked to have a fresher product delivered. Immunocal is the original product, but this should be the same, however Immunocal is TWICE as much and sold by Multi-level marketing.... 3 stars for the old shelf life, otherwise a fine product."

212953,0,"Today Shelley Fabares is best known as the long suffering girl friend and wife on ""Coach,"" but back in 1958 she was Mary Stone, the perfect teenage daughter on the hit ABC domestic comedy, ""The Donna Reed Show."" When Ricky Nelson became a singing star because of performances on ""The Adventures of Ozzie &amp; Harriet,"" the producers of ""The Donna Reed Show"" had Fabares and her young co-star former Mousketeer Paul Peterson head into the recording studio of Colpix Records, the label for Columbia Pictures Television. Fabares was less than thrilled with the idea (she did not believe she had a good singing voice), so it was ironic when her debut release ""Johnny Angel"" reached #1 on the Billboard Pop Charts in early 1962.""Johnny Angel/How I love him/He's got something that I can't resist/But he doesn't even know that I exist."" Every time she passes him in the hall she gets a ""tingle"" and her heart starts to fly every time he says hello. Other boys want to take her out on dates but she prefers to stay home and dream of the heaven their lives will be when Johnny finally wakes up and notices she is the perfect girl for him. ""Johnny Angel"" has the standard girl group sound and while Fabares might not have a great singing voice, but her acting training certainly allowed her to use it well in singing this song. The young girl could have come across as a pathetic lost soul locked away in her room dreaming of a world that is never going to be, but instead Fabares gives her, if not a sense of nobility as she pines away for her love, an undeniable sense of charm as she keeps insisting ""You're an angel to me."" Personally, I think she is too good for the guy.The B-Side of this single is ""Where's It Gonna Get Me,"" which takes a more downbeat look at a similar situation. Both of these tracks are available on Fabares's first album, ""Shelley!"" So, unless you are really, really into CD-Singles that would be the way to go. Of course, ""Johnny Angel"" is also on ""The Best of Shelley Fabares"" as well as assorted hits collections from the period. The song is worth having in your music collection, but I would not suggest this is the best way of getting a copy, unless, as I indicated, you think having classic singles available on CD is kewl."

Those who know anything about B-Complex, understands that certain B vitamins are geared towards helping your body create energy. I've been taking these for a month now. They are half gone. It is possible that I have to complete the whole bottle, wait a littler longer, before I feel the effects. I will say that I'm not sure if I'll buy these again.

214824,0,"I want to love this heating pad, really I do. It's big enough to get where I need it to, it delivers hot moist heat automatically, but the one thing I can't get over, is that you have to keep your hand on the switch the entire time in order to deliver the heat. I used it regularly for constant back pain, but when I lie on the bed, in order to place the pad where I need it to be, and in the position I need to lie so I'm close enough to where the power cord is in the wall, I still have to contort my arm in order to grab the heat switch and keep it delivering heat. Its just become too hard. I understand the theory behind the hand help switch, but couldn't they just put a timer or auto shut off or something. It is VERY inconvenient to contort to keep this thing hot. It feels so good when it's working, but there has to be a better way to use it."

I don't think this toilet or the last 4, from previous apartments, is any different in size and even with the adjustments this trainer will not fit.It's too oval shaped and goes right up the back of the toilet seat making it a very awkward and barely usable fit.

245725,0,"I was given a Braun 7526 as a gift a few years ago. Just over three years later there is something wrong with the razor and it does not work. I've replaced the blade and screen every 18 months. Just before it was time to replace the blade/screen there was a new noise. I hoped that it was the blade/screen that was the problem. After I replaced the blade/screen the noise continued and it does not cut my beard well. There is something wrong with the razor itself.My next question is will I get another Braun razor. At this point I don't think so. I have used an electric razor for years. The one I had before the Braun needed a cord. The Braun was cordless. I liked the cordless aspect. The Braun was self cleaning. I liked the self cleaning aspect, except that the cleaning solution is expensive. I changed the blade/screen every 18 months. I guess if the razor itself had kept working I'd still be using it to shave. At this point I'm looking at spending between $100 and $200 to replace my razor if I buy another Braun. If a three year life span is acceptable then I don't think I'll buy another.As a side point I've been a using safety razor since the Braun stopped working, and I'd forgotten how close the shave is when you use a safety razor. I realize now the Braun did not shave very close. I always needed a safety razor for my neck because the Braun didn't do a good job."

Reality is, it feels colder than BioFreeze and the soothing effect lasts longer than BioFreeze resulting in less applications needed. Personally, I think Sombra has a SLIGHTLY stonger ""aroma"" but not enough to matter. Sombra Cool Therapy is a very good product."

It doesn't make you have to go like a laxative it just makes it much easier to go, and when it is over you feel like you had a complete and satisfying bowel movement. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a little assistance staying regular."

It's difficult to get leaves into it using a rake or those hand-held scoops, because the opening is just not wide enough. During the first use, a corner clip broke that holds the top rectangle (the bag holder) in place, so now it isn't even usable!! Also, it just takes too long to remove and reset all those clips every time you change a bag. I was hoping it had an elastic loop around the top, like my old one had, making bag changes quick and easy. It's also not tall enough. Very, very disappointed."

380565,0,"I've always had this conspiracy theory that when Gillette indroduces a new razor they dull the previous model's blades just a little bit. Oh well, on to the Fusion.I really cannot tell a difference in the quality of shave between the Fusion and the M3. I agree with another reviewer, if all things are apparently equal why spend the extra money?One drawback to the Fusion is that it is hard to clean thick shaving cream out of it. I'm not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick. I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it. Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out. I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades. Either way it annoys me.To sum it up...sure it's a good razor, but it seems more novelty than anything else. The M3 is good enough for me."
87080,1,"I have light brown carpet, but it got the pet urine stains out. With the real bad stains it took 2 times to go over them, but I could see the stains change from yellow to green, then a light brown and eventually faded in with my carpet and are unnoticable now. I'm not sure how well it work work on white carpet, but if you have dark carpet I bet this would work even better. The can says the stains will disappear within seconds. That isn't true. It also says to pat up the excess liquid and spray again in 24hrs if the stain is still there. I spray, then leave on for 10-15 mins, then wipe up any liquid left over. After an hour or so, I spray again and the stains are gone. So, it works well, but don't expect it to be in seconds like the can says. If you leave it on for a while the stains will change color. I'm kind of surprised at how well this worked. I got stuff from walmart before and it wasn't too bad, but there was always a light stain left. This stuff leaves nothing behind. Impressive stuff and well worth the price."

182861,0,"I began D.E. shaving about 2 months ago. Like many I bought this brush since it was inexpensive and I needed everything to get started. The brush works like a champ, doing everything I needed it to do. Mixing creams in a bowl is my technique for lather. I hear a lot of complaints about this brush losing hairs, the knot coming out of the handle, etc. The trick to help prevent this is to make sure that after soaking the brush (never have the water level into the knot) is to flick the excess water out by holding the bristles with the thumb and index finger. This will help prevent losing the bristles from the handle due to excessive force. Also make sure to hang the brush on a stand so that water will not drain back into the handle and it can properly dry. This will ensure that the glue holding the bristles will not break down. After a couple of weeks soak the brush in dishwashing soap and swirl it around to remove residue. I have since added an Omega boar brush to my small collection, but the Tweezerman badger is still in the rotation. For me, this was a good first purchase in a brush. As with all brushes, will give great service if properly cared for."
188499,0,"I ordered 3 tubs of Swiffer wet cloths. The 3 tubs arrived in a plastic bag, placed in a box.

When I have purchased tubs of Swiffer at a store, I have noticed that the tubs are often open and leaking and I have to go through a bunch before I find one that is truly sealed and dry on the outside. I believe this is a flaw in Swiffer's packaging, not in the Amazon order. The tubs are flimsy and the seal on the lid and wrapper doesn't stick."
177169,0,"The background: I have PCOS, so I need something to regulate my periods. I'm not diabetic so metformin was way too strong - it really messed with my moods, as did birth control pills. I've had adverse affects from birth control pills - one caused shortness of breath and I got leg cramps with another. The leg cramps paniced me, but an ultrasound revealed no blood clots. I'll never use combo bc bills again; I wouldn't have after my first try with them, but PCOS has me so desperate to find relief....The first month I tried this cream, it was fine. I got my period spot-on and actually felt calmed. The next, I started getting cramps in my arms and legs. It alarmed me, but they went away when stopping the cream (the cramps developed toward the end of my 14-day use). I find it strange that a prog.-only cream would cause cramps. I've done various searches, and only one natural prog. cream mentioned this as a side effect, saying to discontinue use if cramps develop.I suspect there could be estrogen in this, as another reviewer noted, yams are estrogenic. A shady site I found promoting natural progesterone said that if you develop cramps, get rid of xenoestrogens(coffee, cleaning chemicals, etc.) and the cramps should stop. Why should that make any difference? It leads me to believe there are estrogens in progesterone creams and that using xenoestrogens will give an excess of estrogen (The body reads xenoestrogens as estrogen), thus causing adverse affects. Just a theory. ""Natural"" products and supplements are not rigorously tested by the FDA so I do feel I'm taking a gamble. I feel I should keep using this cream because it did bring on my periods both months and eased some of my PCOS symptoms. All of us PCOS'ers know how hard it is to find the right method of treatment and how much untreated PCOS affects us physically and, worse, emotionally.For a few months, I did nothing but take cinnamon to try to increase my insulin levels (I have insulin resistance, but not diabetes). I'll break out and get terrible bloating and menstrual cramps. I suspect the cinnamon isn't helping much, and I doubt that I'm ovulating. Progesterone can bring about ovulation in PCOS women, so I'm hopeful about this cream, if I ever do want to get pregnant. However, if I continue to get cramps, I'm going to have to cease it. I'm using a lower dose this month to see if that helps. I know from taking Provera that my body is very sensitive to progesterone. Provera caused bad, bad MENSTRUAL cramping in me, but it's funny that I've only gotten these sort of leg cramps from bc pills and progesterone cream. I know from getting an US when I was on the pill that the strange cramping isn't blood clots, BUT what is it? That is the question. I don't have risk factors at all for blood clots, anyway - not over 35, not overweight, no high blood pressure, though my cholesterol is borderline high. It was a huge surprise to my doctors that I have PCOS. I might try a different prog. cream brand and see what happens. I hate to think progesterone creams would contain estrogens."

376715,0,"1. Somehow 7 out of 10 times this device can't record properly. For example, after my son blows in it, it shows 200 and the FEV but then when it's ready for the next blow, instead of zero, it shows Hi. From there, my son's previous reading and all the following attempts will be recorded as Hi instead of any numbers. When it shows Hi, I have to turn it off, and then turn it on again until it shows zero. 2. I didn't purchase the program to analyze the readings but didn't realize without the software I can't transfer the data to my computer either. For the price of this device, I think Microlife should allow users to download data to the computer. 3. the interval between different readings is too short. It makes reading previous records difficult and manually recording previous readings impossible."

409441,0,"HI.I got a free sample of the Solonas Patch's and loved them!

First... they are fairly small. Second, they come 10 to a packet and once you open a packet, you have 90 days to use them or they will lose their ""umph"". Some of the ingredients will evaporate. So, when you open a packet of 10, you must use them up quickly. I don't like that. 2 to a pack fine, but 10? I think it's a gimick by the manufactuer to sell more.This is a factor in my rating because it speaks to the durability of the product. Once opened, you have less than 90 days to use them all or you lose them.They do stick very nicely but there was not much punch with these. Not sure if it was the size, i say no, or something else. I say something else. I've use the icy hot patches that had more umph than these. THe link above... that's the one that got me to buy ALL of the solonas patches to see what i would like more or less.

271826,0,"I clean my father's ceramic tile company once a week, which could definitely use a commercial floor cleaner. I used to mop, which did nothing but redistribute dirt. I purchased this with the rave reviews in mind and I have to admit I like it, but I don't love it, which I wanted with the price tag. It is infinitely better than mopping, but I don't think the vac part works all that great, the scrubbing part doesn't really get all the dirt, so it's okay for light scrubbing, but I have 4 kids and much prefer my steamer for my ceramic floors. It is a Eureka floor steamer and I bought it refurbished for 35 bucks. Less upkeep too, it only uses water and sanitizes and dries almost immediately. I do use both items, alternately, at work, because the ceramic is hard on the pads of my steamer, but I do need to stress that the amount of tile I clean is very large, and the pads are replaceable. Anyway, if I had to pick between the two, I would pick the floor steamer and a handheld steamer (which I also recently bought, because I loved the floor steamer so much) as with the steamers you can clean the floor and wall tile and my handheld cleans windows, bathrooms and steams my drapes and clothing, all for less than half the price of this.

224152,0,"Okay so I bought this razor after finding out that I am HIGHLY allergic to nickel. I had never used an electric before so I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I basically bought this type because they carried it where I worked and I got a discount. I was warned electric razors don't get as close as a normal razor but I was actually really surprised how close this got for the first few times I shaved. I've had it for about a year now and am considering getting a different one. This razor really isn't too bad, but I understand what a lot of people are saying. It does spit hair out randomly all over your leg, it's not the nicest thing to see but I discovered if you pop up the pop up trimmer when you're done with each leg there's hair in it that you can take a tissue and clean out. The charger is kind of a pain. It would be nice to have a cord so I could shave when it's plugged in. There isn't any kind of indicator that shows battery so it's died in the middle of me shaving quite a few times. However I realized if you just listen to it then you can tell when it's running low because it starts slowing down. As for the noise I don't really care much. It doesn't bother me or the people I live with. I absolutely can not shave my underarms with this razor, I've tried numerous times and it burns and scratches. I haven't been able to figure out why it does this. It occasionally scratches my legs but the marks go away pretty quickly and it isn't that painful. All in all I think it's a pretty nice razor, I don't shave often but compared to what I was going through with my allergy, this is WAY better!"

I mix with water which is supposed to be one of the best solvents in the world and this stuff clumps and curdles so much I wonder if they lace it with Elmer's glue. Mix IMMEDIATELY upon impact with your liquid or you're in for a clumpy surprise. I question the effectiveness of protein when it is so extremely clumpy. A good mixer is highly recommended.- Less than average taste. Bland, but tolerable.- Low amount of protein per serving compared to competitors.If you're looking for a cheap access to protein, this is it. Very cheap at Sam's club (if you have a membership). If you're on a very strict budget for supplements, go for it. Otherwise, spring for something a little more noteworthy."

359725,0,"UPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR'S USEThe chillow was wonderful to help keep me cool, and it has stayed cool for almost the full year with only one refill. However, this review has gone from five stars to three stars for the following reasons:The foam core does not stay flat with continued use. It bunches up and cannot be fixed without very intensive and annoying effort. If you use it in your pillow while it's bunched up, it feels like you have lumps of coolness balled up under the pillow case. It's not only uncomfortable, but impossible to sleep on soundly as you adjust through the night.The foam core began to smell so strongly of mildew that it cannot be used. I've never smelled anything like this- it's really bad. When I first received it, it had a slight chemical smell to it. I don't know if those chemicals were meant to keep it from getting mildewy, but it has not worked. The foam core has turned orange. Yuck!This is effective for cooling, but be warned that you will need to replace it for one of the above reasons at some point. I liked it so well that I'm debating buying another, but I'm also looking at other options.***After reading all of the reviews here, I was nervous about ordering my own chillow. I have to say that I am very glad that I did. I have a medical condition that causes me to just wilt in the heat. We live in the desert, so I really need tools to help keep me cool. The chillow has really fit the bill when it comes to staying cool while I sleep. I carefully followed the directions that came with it (they're not hard, but need to be followed exactly), and my chillow has worked wonderfully. It is cool all night long, with none of the leaking or dampness that other reviewers noted. It does have a slight chemical smell that took a little getting used to, but for me the coolness was worth the slight smell.I can imagine that this would be helpful for people with a variety of conditions, including people who get regular headaches and those going through menopause. I have actually thought about getting another so that I can have one at home and one at work to sit or lean on during the day. I am a fan!"
35875,2,"Noni juice has a LOT of claims, but this is not unusual for a lot of ""miracle cures"" and even jokingly claims to have cured cancer.It smells like foul toilet water, and tastes very bad, but not as bad as caster oil.I have allergy problems, and it made claims it does wonders for inflammation/allergies. I'm not a beliver in any kind of medication unless it actually works, so placebos have no power to affect me. I took it everyday for a week, and I noticed no change. I feel just the same. One time I caught a bad cold and started on noni juice. Nothing.My own experience is that you have to believe it works to make it work. Some people have this notion if it tastes bad it gotta work. It also costs about ONE DOLLAR AN OUNCE (that's the recommended dosage on the bottle). That's part of the placebo--it costs a lot so it has to do something.So I wasted about $17 on something that looks, smells, and probably tastes like foul toilet water.How much of this is placebo? Or getting better even without taking anything?Most people who make these outright claims are the...distributors.Be aware that I read two people (on medical journals) had liver failure from what is linked to Noni juice, taking the standard dosage of 1 ounce a day (actually one woman took 2 liters over 3 months). (30 mL daily developing liver failure in about 3 months--about Liters...30 mL daily for 90 days = 2700 mL. This is 2.7 Liters, so she took less than one ounce a day.) Both had no prior history of liver problems.Though this liver failure/toxicity is rare, it STILL happened.How does it interact with other medications? I don't know. I wouldn't want to be the guinae pig that finds out either.Just be careful when you deal with herbal cures. The miracle claims are no different than thousands of other snake oil treatments, and mostly from the distributors. The FDA does NOT regulate herbal cures, so their toxicity, effectiveness, etc., etc. are unknown.Don't say I didn't warn you."
262492,0,"We had purchased this bubble bath a few times for our 16 month old son who loves bubbles. We love that they come with a bubble wand so you can blow bubble while he baths in bubbles. However, the two bottles we received from our most recent order didn't work. No bubbles. You could get bubbles if the bubble bath was poured in to the water but no bubbles with the bubble wand. So, that was a disappointment.On another note, our son had a fever for a few days and saw a pediatrician who said she really discourages parents from using bubbles at all in their child's bath. Even ""all natural"" bubbles like this. They can cause or be a contributer to UTI's in little ones. She was concerned that may have been what was going on with him. In the end, it was just a virus and not a UTI but as a result of our meeting with her, we won't be using bubbles in his bath any more. :("
389827,0,I rated this 3 stars because the product itself is a good product. The stethoscope is light weight and has GREAT sound. Amazon disappointed me a little with this item though.

It also did not come with any additional drum heads or ear bud sizes.

121803,2,"Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads.1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That's what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush. If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month. Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don't have to pack the charger. Just make sure it's topped off and you're good for a month's vacation."
421727,0,"On the plus side, these have 30 grams of high-quality protein for a reasonable amount of calories, and they don't taste bad. However, they also don't taste all that good, and definitely don't taste like actual S'mores. They also contain a fair amount of sugar alcohols, so eating more than 2 of them in a day will cause you some discomfort and bloating.Finally, YMMV, but in my case, each bar was melted to the inside of the wrapper from heat during shipping. I've found this is not uncommon when ordering protein bars off the Internet. It doesn't really affect the taste, but the texture is a little off due to it."

The doctor told me the cuff was probably to small and to return the monitor and get one that had a larger cuff (9-17) instead of (9-13) which this one has. He stated it gives a false high reading when the cuff is to small as well as a false low if to big. He also stated to keep my arm postioned right,placing the cuff 1/2 above elbow and air tube running down the inside of your arm palm side up and keep the arm level with your heart for the most accurate reading.I returned this monitor and purchased the ReliOn Easy Wrap Automatic Monitor made by Omron as well, Model HEM-780 and its readings are alot more accurate as well as a much more comfortable cuff thats easier to put on by yourself one handed!Be sure to measure your upper left arm to make sure you purchase one that will fit properly."
357592,0,"I've taken these pills religiously for about three weeks. The ingredients appear to be exactly what a healthy prostate needs and for long-term health they may be beneficial, but only a strictly controled clincial trial program would really be able to substantiate that. I was hoping that perhaps they would start to kick in and help me avoid having to get up so often at night, but I have not seen any improvement in this area. Again, though, the intention of the product is to promote long-term prostate health more that cure any immediate symptoms. So, if that is what you are looking for, they may be a good choice.One thing I should also note is that these things really smell. I keep mine in the refrigerator to try to tone it down as much as possible. If you have ever taken fish oil supplements and had the dreaded fish burp afterwards, these things will make that experience pale by comparison. The instructions recommend that you take them DURING a meal, meaning you should eat part of your meal, take a pill, then finish your meal. This is apparently to bury them within your stomach to avoid any aftertaste from occuring. This method does indeed lessen, if not eliminate that unpleasant experience completly, so if you do start taking these I suggest you go that route."
364198,0,This massager certainly works well enough- but is really very heavy and awkward to hold. It does the job very well - with a variable speed which is nice.

I have stopped drinking protien shakes and I have picked up a post work out drink. So now I add this to the post workout drink for MORE Glutamine or add to some OJ. I actually add a spoon full to my morning OJ every morning. I read somewhere that Glutamine also helps with boosting your immune system.I have mixed this with juice, post work out drinks and protien shakes..I have not tasted any difference in any of these drinks because of this powder. Mixes very well, the colder the liquid the more you need to mix it but still mixes very well.Some info from the Optimum Nutrition website:Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body, comprising more than 60% of the free amino acid pool in skeletal muscle and greater than 20% of total circulating amino acids. Because L-Glutamine may support muscle recovery from exercise, each serving of our Glutamine Powder provides 5 grams of pure L-Glutamine, and because it's unflavored, you can mix it right into your post-workout protein shake.Made with Pure L-GlutamineUnflavored VersatilityAdd to Protein & MRP ShakesMixes Easily with a SpoonWide Variety of Available SizesSupports Muscle Recovery Efforts"

256941,0,"The adhesive between the gel and fabric is not as long-lasting and reliable as that on Dr. Scholl's gel insoles, but there's not too much heel height like on the newest Dr. Scholls or that lame heel fabric cutout that's clearly just for marketing reasons. Neither of these companies is making zero or near zero drop (the difference in height between the heel to toe end) insoles. They better get their heads on strait and do that before spring as the new lines start comingout. These Ironmans do have a wider excess toe area, so they will fit a variety of shoes, including toe and tabi shoes, and can always be cut down as needed. The Dr. Scholls gels unfortunately seem to be getting more narrow with each generation. Dr. Scholl's shoes are also TERRIBLE in design, but that's a whole different subject. If I had to choose between all the insoles out there, I'd probably go for the original Dr. Scholl's massaging insoles with the purple rear re-enforcement, no middle purple hole, and no fabric hole. Do a search. You'll find them. These Ironmans are otherwise superior except for that fabric peeling issue. Interestingly, the Ironmans I bought 12 years ago that were not thermoplastic blue gel (the classic green ones sold at Footlocker) had the same peeling problem."

By the end of week 1 you are fit to slit your wrists if you see another.2. The weight comes straight back on as soon as you stop. The instructions tell you to go on other diets, but the problem is, you learn nothing about eating on the slimfast diet.3. It can't be good for you. I don't care what they say on the tin. It feels wrong.So, I lost my weight permanently by learning how to eat properly on a proper balanced diet. If you want to learn how to lose weight, it's easy. Go to a doctor who will tell you this:&quot;no alcohol for a year, and lose 14 lbs - then come back for a test. If the test is clear I don't have to perform a liver biopsy&quot;That worked for me.The secrets to losing weight:1. No alcohol- none- ever.2. No bread - none - not even dry granary toast.3. All food consumed in three meals per day made from food that you prepared yourself- no snacks-none- no fast food, and steer clear of restaurants because they are full of bread and wine.4. Leave the car - walk.5. Drink lots of water.It's boring, but it works better than Slimfast.However - if you are getting married in two weeks and can't fit in your dress - Slimfast could be just what you need."

I had to resort to storing them in an airtight glass jar and only opening them outside. Please don't think I'm exaggerating. Personally, I can deal with the smell until I finish the bottle; but my friends and family cant even go in the bathroom where I store them without commenting on the smell. I will not be buying them again solely because of this. I don't notice any extra energy throughout my day compared to days I miss taking them, but I don't normally experience increased energy from most things (caffeinated beverages, energy drinks, other foods...). As far as the pills go, they are a reasonable size. Not too big, but certainly not small.

She was afraid to take pills later on for fear of choking on them. She had 8 pills \ capsules that we put in applesauce and smoothies to try to make it taste a little better, but it was a battle to get her to take them that lasted an hour or so. We saw the ad on the internet and she encouraged me to buy the pill cup for her so she wouldn't have to take the nasty applesauce and smoothie's anymore. We recieved the pill cup 3 weeks ago and she is so proud of herself for swallowing pills now. She today even took most of her pills without the pill cup. She has so much confidence now!! We are very thankful for this product!Somethings that might be helpful to someone considering to buy this product which is also on the instructions:1. Make sure you wash and dry your hands very well before handling pills (capsules expecially)2. It is also helpful when you first start to practice with tic tac's or M & M's first so you don't waste money on the expensive pills.3.

389481,0,"I took a gamble and bought a box of these because I couldn't find individual ones in stores. They're designed ""to withstand the elements"" so you give up some on flavor/texture. They're decent tasting but definitely not the best tasting bars I've had. But they are the most resilient - I'd feel comfortable leaving it in the car in the summer.Taste/description: slightly sweet, very dense, light almond/honey taste. No coating. No variation except for small bits of almond.Pros - balanced nutrition (high protein - 15 grams; not too high in carbs - 22 grams, 2 grams fiber; 6 grams fat), all natural (no artificial sweeteners or even refined sugars), 200 calories, won't melt or crumble.Cons - dry/pasty so you definitely want some water handy, relatively small so not many bites.For a reference point on my flavor preferences, my favorite tasting energy bars/snacks are - Luna chocolate pecan pie, Luna nutz over chocolate, Balance Go Mix toffee crunch, Balance Go Mix chocolate nut crunch. I also like Lara Bar cherry pie and banana cookie (raw foods bars with only three or four ingredients per bar). They are expensive, though, and not as high in protein (4 or 5 grams)."

You can still see the small Creapure logo up on the top right of Amazon's product thumbnail (the orange label is the old one; the label is now blue). Lesser quality creatine often contains toxic impurities due to incomplete synthesis. I bought this brand regularly because that logo meant it was chemically analyzed and guaranteed to be free of such impurities. I received a new shipment yesterday with fancy new label art, but the product no longer carries the Creapure logo. Be aware of this fact before you purchase this creatine. I returned mine because it was not what I expected."

Also it is quite large so you don't have to worry about much light bleeding around the mask.Another reviewer mentioned that these have a bad odor when they're new. Yes, they stink! I opened mine and let it air out for two days and it still smelled as bad. I rinsed it with cold water and let it air dry on my window sill. That helped reduce the smell but it's not gone.The strap is quite long. There is one set of velcro, which is also long so I can adjust it where it's comfortable but not as snug as I want. What's with eye mask manufacturers refusing to use two velcro strips? What's with the eye masks made for giants?This mask has slid down a little on a couple different nights so I would like it to fit more securely.

I rinse with it just once daily, each morning, after drinking coffee and prior to brushing.For me, the key to avoiding any kind of film residue on my teeth is to rinse thoroughly after brushing. This sounds obvious, but trust me, I rinse about four or five times. My wife, who does not use the product, rinses about half as much.I can attest to the whitening power of this product, though it may not be as effective with all users. Admittedly, I don't have the preternaturally gleaming teeth we see on TV these days, but my smile has grown considerably brighter since using this pre-brush rinse. It's made a difference for me, and I'll keep using it.(By the way, I had tried a cheaper store brand pre-brush rinse twice daily prior to using Listerine, and though it whitened my teeth, it also began to eat away at the skin inside my lower lip. It wasn't painful, but it was troubling, so I discontinued use. Based on this experience, I opted to use the Listerine product only once daily, and immediately after my morning coffee. This has seemed to work well, and I've experienced no downsides with the Listerine rise.)"

It's essentially a thin metal bar bent into a U shape and is quite flexible and can be bent as wished.2. A small, cavernous metal spoon can do the same job this product can if you can find a spoon small enough to fit into your mouth completely.When I used it yesterday and today, I found out that while it got rid of the white goo on my tongue, once I cleaned off the goo, the hairs on the tongue were still white no matter how much I rubbed this thing on my tongue. I even rubbed until I made my tongue bleed at one point and it was still as white as before. So, while this may work for some people, this is definitely not for me. And also, I do not have geography tongue and this product may have been designed for those with geography tongue."

I'm not saying it isn't a good product, I'm only saying I've had similar items that I personally liked better.Let's lead with the negatives. Everyone always feels obligated to lead with a positive, right? Well not this time...1. It simply will not stay put. No matter what size I make it (S, M, L or XL) it just moves around all over the place inside my mouth. There are no ""inner wings"" to keep it from moving from side to side, and there is nothing to keep it from moving forward either. The little tiny ""strap"" on the front doesn't offer any real resistance to forward movement - so it moves forward freely - and constantly.2. I sleep on my side at least part of the night and the pressure on my face causes the device to move away from my teeth into my mouth. When I wake up it will be in my mouth somewhere, but not always between my teeth. Some of the time it's just a tangled, rubbery globOn the positive side, it would definitely be comfortable to use if it would just stay in one place while it's in (for me, it won't - for you, maybe it will?)."

I usually dont like anything minty other than peppermint, this product is like spearmint or wintermint or something. But its not bad smelling. Its more floral than any other smell. Its like when you walk in to bath and body works and smells like a chick. Its got a chick flower smell. But it isnt over powering and it doesnt smell like that on your body for very long.I give it it ""okay"" (3 stars) and ""I like it"" (4 stars). Its not what I expected and if I were in the store and able to pop the top and smell it, I probably would have passed it up. But its still a good product and Ill use it until its gone. The things I wanted out of the product that it is lacking are the following:1) theres no cooling effect like it said2) its not like lava soap, its too small of pebbles (or what ever they are) to feel a good scrub3) no mint smell what so ever. The flora smell is stronger than I expected (im just glad it doesnt last very long b/c if it did, id trash it)."

127209,0,"I am very sensitive to light and bought this eye mask to help me sleep in my room, which is constantly lit up by street lights.Pros:Effective at blocking out light (the light from the nose bridge that some people have commented about was negligible).Contoured mask keeps pressure off eyes.Cons:Strap pushes down on ears, to the painful point of waking me up.Any time I sleep on my stomach or side, the eye 'bubbles' invert and put more pressure on my eyes than a non-contoured mask.The cons often outweigh the pros, since the pain or pressure wakes me up more than light would. Even when the mask doesn't wake me up, I often push off the mask at night, defeating the whole purpose. That said, I think this is a decent mask, especially for the price, and would work well for back sleepers or travelers who must sleep upright."

113164,0,"The pressure facing health and beauty grooming appliances is tough... they have to constantly think of new and better ways to improve their products, EVEN THOUGH they may have already reached a technological ceiling. It's because of the competitive nature of the business. They could make subtle improvements in an existing shaver and price it less, but people won't buy it because there isn't some compelling difference. So, companies keep trying to invent catch phrases and ambiguous functionality, in order to keep prices up (with the illusion that you're getting more if you pay more).How much better can a foil shaver get? Braun reached a major pinnacle with the 7000 series. The Syncro line was the first introducing a head cleaning system, as well as a faster motor with side-to-side vibration. You take a shave with a 7000 series and this new 7 series, and guess what? You won't feel a noticeable difference. A few other reviewers have noticed this as well.Having been a Braun shaver owner for over 15 years, my latest model is the 8595 Activator. It is the equivalent to the 9595, only being from the previous generation. It has almost everything the 9595 has, except for the new casing design and the indicator that tells you when to change the shaving head cassette.I happened to have a friend who bought one of these and managed to get him to loan it to me for a week (we traded shavers). Guess what? After a week, we compared notes and discovered that we BOTH found the shaving performance identical between the 8595 Activator and the 790cc Pulsonic (9595).Braun lauds its ""new"" Pulsonic technology, but in essence it is the same technology they've had since the 7000 series. Quite frankly, I don't think it's worth spending an extra $100 to get the Series 7 model. Instead, I'd buy a new old stock 8595 or 8995 model for about $100 cheaper. Also, you'll save quite a bit of money of the long haul on head replacements. The 9595 (790) uses a ""cassette"", which is essentially the foil and cutter block combined into one unit. You cannot buy them separately. You damage the foil? The whole thing requires replacing. Why did Braun do this? Well... to close a loop hole. On the earlier models, you can replace just the cutter block and keep the your current foil. After all, if the foil is undamaged, it is still doing its job. From a shaving outlet, you can buy the 8000 series cutter block for just $10. The 9595 cassette costs $50! You do the math..."

426072,0,"First of all, let me praise the use of nasal irrigation for allergy relief. I've also found that the powered ones (like both the Hydro Pulse and the SinuPulse) work better than syringes and the like.As far as I can tell there are two main units available, this Grossan unit and SinuPulse. The Grossan unit was made in Taiwan, and the SinuPulse in mainland China. I owned a Grossan unit for a couple years, lightly used during allergy season, before it died. Read the reviews -- it's apparently a fairly common problem. Upon disassembly, the cause was the motor armature binding (not burnt out, just frozen unless disassembled to the point the end cap was loose). The cheap plastic piston pump still moved fairly freely and there was no build up of salt since I had flushed the unit with distilled water after every use.A SinuPulse recently arrived -- it's far too early to tell how well it will hold up. However, I can compare the designs, ease of use, and the effectiveness.Effectiveness? They're about the same. Both also have a range of pressure adjustments and both want to be used more to the upper end.Ease of use? I'd put the Grossan unit ahead. Its fluid chamber is a fairly durable container that can serve for both mixing the salt solution and then dispense it. The SinuPulse unit has a squarish unit of a more fragile plastic (and not covered by the warranty) that doesn't work well for mixing (hard to hold, square corners, easily scratched, harder to drain). So you'll need an extra container to mix the saline solution with the SinuPulse.Design? It's a closer call on some of the design features. The SinuPulse makes it slightly easier to change nozzles with a push button to release, if that's important (not to me). The Grossan has a more useful on-off device at the handle while the SinuPulse has an annoying momentary contact (probably just presses against the tube) off option. The solution container on the Grossan unit is a more durable plastic and easier to clean, but the shut off valve on the bottom will leak now and then (not sure yet how the SinuPulse compares). Both units require a thorough flush with (preferably distilled) water to avoid salt or hard water deposits from clogging the pump. Both instruction manuals have unrealistic expectations, such as unplugging the units (they have an on-off switch) after every use.Price? About the same.Reliability? Don't have a real comparison yet. The Grossan seems to last a couple years in average use before dying. The SinuPulse has a two year warranty (versus one year for the Grossan). Both look to be somewhat cheaply made in China. Both warn that you must flush the unit after every use to get rid of any salt that might remain in the pump. If you have hard water, you probably should also use distilled water for this.The bottom line is that someone should be able to make a better unit for the $80 or so these cost. If the SinuPulse actually lasts significantly longer, it might be worth putting up with its annoyances. Otherwise, the Grossan looks to be the slightly better designed unit, at the cost of replacement every year or two or so (which will add up to a heap of broken units over a lifetime of use)."

A year later I'm 200lbs, benching 315lbs (before barely 225lbs) and obtaining all the protein necessary for a shake in the morning and post-workout. I typically run through a tub (10lbs) once a month. Only thing with this product, is once you put in a shake cup immediately there's chunks staying at the bottom. What I've learned is that you let it sit in fridge for approx. 3hrs+ and the protein will dissolve in water/milk/juice whatever it maybe. Taste awesome."

Pros: they do cushion the impact, give good arch support, my feet didn't move around in my boots and they didn't pinch my second toe. Cons: hard to judge cutting insoles just right, hard to adjust correctly once inside the boots and after the hike I still had pain. I'll continue wearing them for the long hikes but bandaging up other parts of my feet. Hope one day I can find insoles that help with metatarsalgia and Plantar Fascitis."

128437,0,"i tried the gillette sensor 3 because it got rave reviews, and it totally sliced my face up. i waited a couple of days for the razor burn to lessen some, then tried this mach 3 turbo. well, i only got 1 cut apart from the razor burn so that was good. but it gave me microcuts all over the razor burn - probably my fault for not waiting long enough to shave.. (i used neutrogena razor defense gel)but here's what might bug YOU - at first i noticed drag - what the heck? i hate drag! it wasn't even much growth at all!! i haven't used manual razors in a long time, but i get the feeling that gillette's blades are just not sharp enough. i want it to slice through a little growth like butter! heck, that's what razors are for. i bet if i went to the barber and got one of those old style, sharp blade shaves, he'd cut right through it, with no razor burn either. also the shave feels good, but when i look in the mirror i see some little black hairs. so i'm questioning this whole 3, 4, 5 blades business. are more blades really better? (especially for sensitive skin guys like me?) a website says this: ""c. Use a single blade razor, as twin or triple blades tend to scrape the skin, resulting, more often than not, in razor bump. Also avoid disposable razors."" hmm.. i might have to give a single blade razor a try. but i do like the mach 3 swivel.. pivot head thing. it seems to me, in theory at least that should help you reach places under your chin better.at least it seems a lot safer to use than the gillette sensor 3 ...."

It happened twice. I reduced the number of pills taken before workout to just one or two. Advice: don't take more than two per day."

It might work ok for watch crystals or cell phone screens, but the finish is not clear enough for eye glasses."
51399,0,"I purchased the Silk epilator at the beginning of the summer after reading the rave reviews. It was definitely painful the first time, and I was shocked by the mess and quantity of all the little hairs it pulled out! I figured out that it was best to either sit on a towel or stand in the shower (water off, of course!!!) I guess with shaving I never noticed how much hair was coming off. It is noisy, my husband had to turn up the TV when I tried it in the living room... And it takes a while, um, ages. The light is really helpful in seeing all the hairs, but for me it took multiple passes to get them. Afterwards my legs were red and patchy, so I'd usually use the epilator at night. I really wanted to like this product and use it forever... But unfortunately it's just not compatible with my skin/hair type: sensitive skin and thick, dark hair. After hair removal I used Price Reigns ingrown hair serum, exfoliated with a loofah, everything people had recommended. However, I still got ingrown hairs. Over time, they got worse and worse, and I just kept getting more and more. I loved not having to shave every other day, but I think the turning point came when my husband asked me why my legs were so spotty. After trying it for about 6 months, I have stopped using the epilator and my legs are 'going into remission...' I actually purchased the Conair Hair Removal system (which is supposed to exfoliate away hairs.) Not sure about the hair removal aspect of that product, but it exfoliates well and will help me get all the ingrown hairs out. Sadly, it's back to shaving for me. If the epilator works with your skin/hair type, this would be a great product. But for me, and I'd guess anyone else with sensitive skin and thick hair...good luck trying. It's probably been 2 months now since I stopped using the epilator, my legs are looking better but I still have some deep ingrown hairs, I don't know how they'll ever come out."

They are soft on arrival so heat is not your friend with these bars."
70845,0,"I am using Norelco shaver for last four five eyars. Few months back I bought this shaver to upgrade from previous model 8x speedLx. Shaving on the contour of neck and chin was easier then previous before. However a few times when I pressed hard for close shave it did cut the soft skin and produced skin burns, which I never had with any previous model. The worst thing is that it stopped working after 3 months of use. Although Norelco customer service is outstanding and excellent, but 3 months is no time for a such an expensive item. I am not sure it is a coincident with me but I found Norelco shavers not reliable. Usually they do not last more than an year. Although it comes with one time warranty replacement, but still it is a risky deal.I am giving it 3 stars since it was easier to use on contours and that Norelco customer service was excellent. Within five minutes of chat with the representative, replacement was on my way. But if it did not work for an year then it would be my last Noreleco shaver."

113574,0,"Still not sure what the difference is between the Series 7 and the 9000 series (maybe US/European?), but the shavers look identical. I've used the 9595 for about a year and it is definitely the best electric shaver I've used, and I've used a lot (Panasonic, Norelco, Remington). The one con I would submit is that (on the 9595) the silver paint on the plastic back above the rubber handle just below the head seems to dissolve over time in the cleaning solution (less than a year of daily use). Really inexcusable by Braun on a shaver this price, but I didn't subtract from the score because functionally it does everything advertised; they just need to get engineering to add a metal strip to this vulnerable area and nix the cheap plastic.Addendum to above after a year of use:Good:- Quick shave, new ""Pulsonic"" action of head does provide a quicker, cleaner shave.- Cleaning unit probably the best of a not very good lot to clean and sanitize shaver- Good ergonomics and easy to useWorse:- Very cheaply made, as others have observed; I would guess more than 80% plastic- Some features very poorly engineered; case in point, the head ""Lock"" button is held on by I would guess a plastic cylinder less than 1 mm thick, and mine recently fell off, as other have reported. This design could not possibly last much longer than the warranty period without breaking, and it appears to be built with that thought in mind.- Speaking of warranty, other customers are right - Braun customer service is non-existant; you will be referred to your nearest ""customer service center"" to negotiate a repair or replacement on your own. I live in a major metropolitan area, and mine is located in a small town more than an hour away, and appears to be a Mom & Pop operation not much interested in repairing Braun's mistakes.I would change my rating to no higher than a 3 based on my extended experience, but I am unable to modify the original rating*. I purchased a Panasonic wet & dry shaver, which is a little more messy but provides a smoother and more comfortable shave, a better built razor and definitely a more customer-friendly company.*Changed rating"

That also means I can't boil it, so cleaning could be a concern.One thing that tickled me is that it comes with very detailed instructions on how to use the toy (using scientific terminology of course), which were quite helpful. Without them, I may have been laying in the completely wrong position! (Only kind of sarcastic here)The tip is a bit wide, and since I'm kind of a beginner down there, I had some trouble getting it in at first. But once inside, it sat quite nicely. But that's the problem. It sat. The way it aligns with the body results in a very tight fit, and I had trouble manipulating it to accomplish the perineum massage I was so looking forward to. The inserted portion rests against the prostate pretty well, but I couldn't move my toy to stimulate it any further. It felt like nothing more than a narrow buttplug."

296244,0,"As a person who needs to wear a knee brace on an everyday- all day basis, I found one important fault with this brace. The back of the brace has some sort of mesh material that is abrasive on the back of the leg right at the bending position and makes it uncomfortable to wear. When you first put the brace on, it feels good. After wearing it for about an hour, you feel the mesh cutting in to the back of the knee and it hurts. I then have to place a tissue inside the brace to block the mesh from the back of the leg and that is not an easy thing to do. Also the top of the brace tends to fold over.I actually like the way the rest of the brace is structured and hope that eventually the mesh softens enough for everyday wear. I think that the description should state that the mesh exists and maybe even why they chose to add it to the product."

51557,0,"I like this product. However, I have been using it as directed for 1 month, and I have yet to not have stuble. I think that it pulls lots of hairs from the root, but it also breaks some off. This causes the stuble. I have noticed that some hairs take weeks to grow back, but a lot grow back within a week.For those who have always shaved, SHAVE FIRST, then use the epilator every day for two weeks. This will DRASTICALLY reduce the pain. It does hurt, but it is true what they say about it not hurting as bad the more you use it. I think that when the hair is pulled out, it weakens the root, causing less pain.Powder helps a lot. Make sure you use the brush to clean it after every use, or it will get all jammed and it will not grip hairs. It takes about an hour to do both legs. I have not used epilators in the past, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think that it takes too long. Hopefully, if I keep using it, eventually I will get every hair and have no more stubble. BE SURE TO EXFOLIATE!!!! If you don't YOU WILL GET INGROWN HAIRS!!! PROMISE!!!All in all, it is a good product, but don't expect some miracle machine that makes your legs feel the way the models do after they spend hundreds on a wax job. LOL. I wanted my legs to feel like butter in my husband's hands, but sometimes I find myself ""checking"" my legs to be sure I won't scratch him! That is something I never did when I shaved.

We can't space save with it either, it sits in our tub most of the time, but I like it. The little sling, well I will admit that that doesn't stay in place most of the time, particularly when your little one can't sit but can roll and tries to all the time! But, we work with it, and she likes it... much better than the regular bath tub. I'd recommend it, but as a time saver and convenience... not everything toted on the box!

It made me drowsy at first, but gave me shoots of energy every time I started drifting off.Somehow, it helps me during the day, though.

24639,0,"First of all, let me say this....ZANTREX 3 is NOT FOR EVERYONE. I have read the reviews and I have seen how some people take it in differently. Some develop these problems, others don't. So that much is clear, IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE.Second of all, yes it says it'll shed some pounds for you. But in order to make sure this is effective, you have to put in work. You can't expect to eat like a pig and take this and still lose weight. No. If you want to really lose weight and use Zantrex 3, you have to eat the right way which means no eating fast food, and eating smart, of course. And of course, exercise. Cut off fast food, PLEASE! That stuff is like poison to the human race. It may taste good but you only not doing your body so good. And #1 weight tip from....DRINK LOTS OF WATER.Okay, on to my review. Before I took Zantrex 3, I have already lost 30 pounds on my own. My goal was to lose 50 pounds. When I first started taking Zantrex, I started with one pill just 15 minutes before my breakfast meal. I started with one pill, then after a while I took the recommonded dosage which is 2. I reached my goal of losing 50 pounds. I was 192 pounds, now I am 140 pounds. I was a pant size 36, now I am a pant size (waist) 30. I lost lots of weight with Zantrex 3. I am proud! I am happy! I feel great, I look great! I thank myself and also of course, Zantrex 3. But at the same time, I feel bad because Zantrex 3 is a very strong product.The side effects....when I take Zantrex 3....I get a high boost in energy as if I could take on the day. I do get a little hyper and a little jittery and shakey. I hate that feeling. But it gives me the energy to fulfill my day. I don't crash or anything. My appetite...I think this supplement actually reduces it because whenever I don't take it, I am hungry all the time but when I do take it, I am only hungry at different times of the day.I do realize that when I take it on a day, I have trouble sleeping at night. I usually sleep around 10PM, but with Zantrex 3, I don't sleep til 12AM-1AM....around that area or so.It's a good diet AID. I mean I say it is an aid to lose weight, not the actual do-er of losing weight. I take it as an aid because Zantrex 3 boosts your metabolism to HELP you lose weight. That means you have to put in the work.However, whenever I workout, and finish, my heart is beating so fast and furious. I don't really like that at all.I give this product 3 stars due to some of the negative things I just mentioned (sleeping, heart beat problems).I'll say this product should be use as an aid to HELP you lose weight. And I say this product should only be use for the ones who are in good condition...no heart problems...no diabetics...no high cholestrol or such and such.Take my advice....if you wanna use this product, don't start off with this. First try and lose a few pounds first on your own and when you near your goal, use Zantrex 3. BUT BE CAREFUL. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.I took just one pill of Zantrex 3 this morning and I still have a high bar of energy in me. It was just one instead of two and i still have all this energy. This stuff is strong and like I said, it's NOT FOR EVERYONE.In the end, I say you should maybe just maybe do not use this at all. If you decide to, BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THIS STUFF IS VERY STRONG.DON'T TAKE IT EVERYDAY. TAKE ONLY TWO A DAY. MAYBE ONE. (MY SUGGESTIONS IS ONE). TAKE IT EVERY OTHER DAY, NOT EVERY SINGLE DAY. If you wanna make sure you sleep tonight, TAKE THIS IN THE MORNINGS (5AM-8AM) Not in the afternoons or half of the day because if you do that, you'll not gonna be able to sleep."

It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars.

164104,1,"I so wish I would have know about the diva cup years ago. I was an OB Ultra tampon user until they were discontinued. I had no idea what I was going to do. After some research I decided to try the cup since it can hold more liquid then tampons. With a heavy flow that was important to me. Here is what I love: you never have to worry about running out of tampons or pads. You never have to worry about forgetting to take your pads or tampons with you. I love that no one has to know i'm on my period. You can leave it in when eliminating, no string to get wet, for up to 12 hours, four to five hours on my heavy days. It's not messy and no smells. Easy to clean. There is a learning curve, make sure you have the suction on the cup when you insert. Some might wonder how you use it in a public bathroom. If you pull it out the right way the mess stays in the cup, pour out, wipe inside with TP or wet wipe reinsert. The outside usually doesn't get messy which is pretty cool. When at home I keep an electric hot water kettle in the bathroom (dedicated for this use only) and boil the cups. I have several cups so I can rotate and boil during the week. I also discovered fuzzy bunz reusable pads that were awesome and oh so helpful during the initial trials of the diva cup the pads made me feel more comfortable as I gained confidence that the cup actually works and won't leak. What I don't love about the cup: I have found that doing yoga or going upside down will cause some leaking no different then when you leak with a tampon. Laying down and sleeping at night is no problem I never have leaked though getting out of bed can cause leakage. Over all I have loved this product and would highly recommend it to my friends. If for some reason you have tried a cup and it didn't work don't give up they come in all different shapes and sizes."

That cover has no holes and I have not had any problems since. Every Roho cushion I've ever bought has had this same problem.

I don't have the ingredient list with me at the moment, so I can't see the sweetener that is used--I guess it has to be something natural, maybe stevia?--but whatever it is, there is too much of it. With the other powders I would mix with milk, but this one was so strong that I have to mix with water and use only 3/4 of a scoop instead of a whole scoop just to be able to drink it (and that is not even enjoyable)."
194055,0,"Before I continue, please note that the chocks I have are caution orange instead of the black shown. I honestly think the orange makes it harder to forget about them when cleaning up. That said . . .I'd say that's one of the few redeeming factors for this product. Despite the bottoms having ""teeth"", they don't really have any purchase on solid surfaces such as concrete or tarmac. The vehicle noticeably rolls when wrenching on a lugnut: NOT what I want to see.One chock always seems to ""lock in"" after the first rock or two, but the other stays loose. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect the car to run me over. I'm just not excited about the idea of the car rolling at ALL while I'm fussing with it.I used a couple large bricks before getting these, I started using them again afterwards. That makes this purchase somewhat superfluous.Bottom line: They will keep your vehicle in the driveway, but not necessarily keep it on your jack."
253926,0,"Okay, so I originally got this Hitachi as a sex toy. It FAILED! The vibrations were like a massive earthquake..or bodyquake I guess. Also the original head (I haven't tried the head replacements) is really firm and has a texture; so it adds pain to my sensitive lady bits. HOWEVER, the Hitachi is very promising as a back massager (figure that, it does what it was made for). But it is still a little too powerful for my legs and tickles my butt, I can only comfortably use it on my back. The texture is still uncomfortable but adding oil to the skin fixes this problem. The Hitachi is nice for a couple; my husband and I take turns using it on each other. Other down side, it is fairly loud and large and only has two settings - Earthquake or Apocalypse."

I would have preferred multiple heads for each family member or the option to select multiple heads for many family members instead of multiple heads for different uses."

351444,0,The best way to use this sloughing lotion is to rub about half an inch of cream into dry feet. If your feet are wet it will take longer for the cream to dry out. Once it starts to dry you will see little bits of skin peeling off. I suggest you sit with your feet in the tub for the best results. Then you can just wash the bits of dry skin down the drain. This will not immediately remove all the dry skin on your feet like if you have calloused skin it might take a while to get all the dry skin off. I'd suggest using a file and then using this product afterwards. It is very moisturizing and you don't have to wash it off after you apply it. This product is perfect for people who like to go barefoot or wear sandals. If you use this a few times a week you will see results. I use this in place of an Avon product that is no longer sold. Yes your feet will feel slightly tingly from the peppermint oil.~The Rebecca Review
102562,1,"I am SO hooked on these. I have a lot of food sensitivities/digestion problems, so I avoid dairy, gluten, sugar alcohols, eggs etc. My digestion has never been better since I started having Builder bars for breakfast.

314503,0,"I am really disappointed with this product. Surely, it is a godsend for those who do have chemical sensitivities, but our family chose Seventh Generation because we have a septic system and we don't want to potentially pollute the groundwater. It's a bonus that less pollution is created in the manufacturing process to make this detergent versus ""regular"" detergents.Well, the part that bums me out is that it does not get the laundry clean. The clothes and towels looked dingy coming out of the washer and smelled unpleasant, but for awhile I chalked that up to the absence of fragrance and brightening agents. Then I started paying closer attention and convinced myself after carefully inspecting some shirts my husband had worn working out in the job that the detergent was not getting the soil out. In short, it doesn't work. It doesn't get the clothes clean.I have tried using larger than the recommended quantity detergent per load and using high wash temperatures, and this does help, but then I figure, what good is that for the environment if I am now washing my laundry with hot water when I used to use cold? And what is the benefit of creating less pollution ounce per ounce when I am using twice as MUCH of the detergent now.I find this to be true for all of the Seventh Generation laundry detergents I have tried: powder and liquid. I find that the type with the orange fragrance worked best for me, because at least it helped mask the B.O., but honestly, I dislike other no-fragrance detergents, including Tide, which at least gets the dirt out.I still am using 7th Generation while looking for another alternative, but I am dissatisfied."

246809,0,"The reason some people have wonderful experiences with these and some have dreadful experiences is not just a function of the water quality. I have been using them for years because I have Sjogren's Syndrome (like Venus Williams) and my bronchi and sinuses are very dry. Some of the units have lasted me for 3 years and some have been problematic from the start. We had one that spat from the beginning with just enough salt to make steam. One I have had for a year or two burned up yesterday. I came into the room and smelled something nasty and saw smoke so we called the fire department. They were less than helpful. After they left, I picked up the unplugged unit and smelled the water inside. It stank of burned plastic - the same smell in the room. However, out of over ten years using these, this is the first one to do this. So if you get one that doesn't work or spits, take it back and get another. Chances are it will work for you."

Or I might buy something more simple. It doesn't taste too bad, if you put it in enough liquid, although the instructions tell you to put it in 1 or 2 ounces of liquid if desired.

I originally was purchasing the Lysine treats from my Vet which were 120 for $30. Considering I was giving Kitty 4/day (the max allowed) and his ""owner"" decided she suddenly wanted him, I wasn't comfortable leaving expensive treats outside hoping Kitty would get them (the birds started eating the food I was leaving out for him as well as other dogs/cats). So I found this poduct and purchased it.It's been almost a month, and although Kitty's eyes are clear, he is still raspy. The treats seemed to be more effective. But I also haven't compared the dosages to each other, so I probably need to adjust the powder to equal that of the 4 treats. Kitty also receives an oral immune booster prescribed by the vet - administered whenever I can get to him."
47546,0,the medication compartments are small. If you take many meds this is a serious problem. Given that those who tend to need this kind of devise also tend to take several pills several times a day it is rather impractical for the compartments to be so tiny. They cannot reasonably hold more than 3-4 pills each. Worse if the any of the pills are big there goes the entire compartment and sometimes big ones won't fit unless you reduce the number of compartments. Even when the compartments are reduced in number the size leaves much to be desired. The battery cover also falls off easily which can be bothersome. Yet I do appreciate the handiness of having something that can remind for more than 2 doses each day.

61882,0,I was only really able to use this when my son was tiny. Like other reviewers stated the 'hump' in the middle is a definite design flaw! I had to sit my son's rear end in the smallest part of the tub when he got bigger... and now he's too big to lay down in it but not sitting up on his own yet. So the tub is useless to me now.Good points: I really like how colorful it is! Very durable! The mesh hammock is made well with a foam bumper and head rest!
378755,2,Like the sling. Hate the tub. Even after getting the tub locked (which wasn't an easy task) it leaked along the seam and because it was suctioned down it leaked all over the counter before I got it moved to the sink.

352221,0,"Every time I buy something without reading the reviews, I regret it. This is definitely one of those situations. The picture perspective definitely makes the pillow look much longer than it is. Even the picture on the package makes it look like you should have at least 6 inches on both sides extending from your legs. I got out my tape measure. The length I measured was 16"", not the 17"" listed in the product description. I held the tape measure over my legs and I measured 16"" there too. I'm not a petite person, but I don't think 6"" would extend out on both sides if I was a 3 year old. If you want to use this while sleeping, I would suggest getting two of these, one for each leg. The pillow is quite firm, but does compress more easily on the ends, which is where your legs end up resting. If you are using it while awake, one pillow would probably do."

302104,0,"The soap is pretty good in this kit and it lasts forever. (and it smells nice) The brush does its job alright, but it doesn't hold water great and it takes a really long time to break in. (it's boar bristle, not badger) For the same price or less you could get the Tweezerman badger hair brush and a bar of shave soap that will end up being a better deal for the money."
268784,0,"I like the taste, but noticed that the tea seemed weak. I purchased a three-pack of 24 tea bags and noticed later that the expiration date on the bottom of packages read 4/17 even though I just purchased them a few weeks ago (Aug-Sep 2012). I am almost finished with the second box so I guess it's too late to return them. Amazon needs to be more diligent about checking a product's expiration date before sending it out. I will probably not order this again from Amazon, but will try to contact the company that makes the tea directly."
231746,0,"I have had to get up at least once every night to urinate over the last four years and I would get a total of about 3 to 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep during that time. Since I started taking this product a week ago, I'm getting at least two more hours of sleep every night before I have to get up to urinate. May not sound like much but six hours of uninterrupted sleep vs. 3 or 4 is a BIG difference - particularly in how you feel the next day. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!Unfortunately, it quit workin well after a few weeks"
29057,0,"Maybe my facial hair is thick/plentiful but i find this shaver really struggles to get the job done. With some effort it can be done however. After a couple months of usage I wanted to throw it away because it started to pull on my hair instead of cutting it, and this was even on areas where hair wasn't thick. I'll chalk it up to a bad egg because everyone else here seems to love this shaver. Certainly not me, it's the worst I ever had."
87256,1,It works but for those whom are technically inclined a homemade batch is better. The product claims are true and have been used for centuries.
238015,0,"I had to go and install this for my parent's (they are 81), because it comes with a lot of parts and isn't the easiest for older hands to hold, screw, place, wrap etc... A great idea, but needs to have an easier way to install."
251242,0,"This is not at all easy to admit and I am really putting myself out there by saying it. I have recommended Alli to everyone I know and was sharing my experiences with the world. I have to be honest and say that when I first started using this product, before it was available to the general public, I was incredibly excited about the results.I was one among a group of people selected for the product testing. I followed the plan to the letter and lost 50 pounds. Some of us were asked to submit our results by video to be selected for a national advertising campaign. My video was selected and I was flown to New York for a chance to be in the first ""Real Person"" nationwide commercial.By the time I filmed the commercial for GSK, I looked and felt fantastic. I was on my way to a new life and I still have the video to prove it. My shot was selected to go Nationwide in early 2008. I was only identified as Laura P. from Mesa, AZ. Once I reached my goal and was off all the fanfare, I laid off the product for a while. Life happened, I went through a divorce, had major stress in my life, and I put the weight back on.I still use the product religiously, watch my fat intake, and get the same amount of exercise that I always have. I walk 3 miles every week day morning and drink a ton of water. Not only is Alli not working at all for me this time around, my weight has increased and gone out of control. I feel like my body had become dependent on the product while I was taking it a few years ago and once I stopped using it, my body stopped responding.I haven't stopped loving the product. I might need to make more changes in my life. I just wanted to make the public aware of what I am personally experiencing. One day I will get back down to my goal weight. I still have that faith."

269462,0,"This item feels comfortable and relieves some of the wrist strain but it is awkward to use. It interferes with mouse movement. It is great is all you have to do is type. But is you are doing a lot of document editing and have to move between the mouse and keyboard, it gets in the way."
69141,2,"Purchased this product as an alternative to the sleep & depression pills based on very favorable review of the product. After taking this at night it felt like my heart was going to pound through my chest. I chalked this upto my body getting used to the product, so i tried it an additional 3 days and each day was the same. My feeling is that the dosage (mg) might be to high or the product is not effective, but either way will not be purchasing. Will try Jarrow brand 5-htp instead."
375757,1,"I remember using this home fragrance years ago and then it just disappeared. I find it to be very close to the original fragrance, and liked it well enough to buy the spray and refills.A wonderful scent just wafting through my home...also noticed by friends/family as soon as they enter my home. Wouldmake a nice gift basket!"
69721,0,While the band is a good product the resistance is much more than medium which is what I wanted. My physical therapist told me not to use it and I had to order the light resistance one which is perfect. Great product for those who are allergic to latex.
260025,0,"Well, I got this on line from the secure web site. When I first used it, it worked so well that I got rid of the Fixodent that I was using. However, I must caution anyone with soft denture relines or that use drug store type temporary soft relines, the cream doesn't last very long. I read this caution only after I had bought it. The cream may last for one meal tops when I have the soft temporary reline type wedges(that's the best way I can describe them) I really do wish this adhesive worked better than Fixodent or Polident, but it really doesn't most of the time for me. I'm still looking for a good adhesive that will actually work all day long. Another problem (for me anyway)When I put the dentures in with the adhesive, there is a bad burning sensation with my gums. the company says that's normal. I don't' like it and I doubt I'll buy any more of this product since it's more expensive and not any better than what I was using."

377975,1,"I received this tub at my baby shower 13 months ago. I have had no problem at all with the tub, at first my daughter took her baths on the counter in the tub next to the sink, now at a year old she still takes them in this tub, but we put this little tub in our big tub! We never had any problem with leaks, and we always felt that she was safe in it. Especially when she was able to sit up by herself."
81815,1,"This is a good pair of tweezers. The ends are a bit bulky and seem like they could lead to the product not maintaining it's sharpness and accuracy.I would easily buy these again in the future.Also, they send you whatever they have in this style. While the picture is black, my tweezers are primarily white with light and dark teal circles on them. They're pretty, but it's definitely a shock to open something expecting one thing and receiving something else!"
199052,2,"Bought this and had it shipped especially from the States to the UK because it looked better than what I could find here. It is nice and long and the sides do make it difficult, not impossible, for a baby to roll. But the plastic cover cracked and split before I'd had it very long. Even with the towel cover, there is still a possibility that pee can get through and soaked up in the sponge underneath, making it smell of urine."

14620,0,"I have used these diapers. They have good absorbency but they suffer from the same problem that all two tape diapers, they do not fit well. I really think a good overnight diaper needs three tapes each side and an elastic waist band."
193831,0,"Bite Blocker was not only repellent to mosquitoes, but to the human nose as well. As much as I wanted to like this product, and this coming from a mosquito bait who will try anything to stay away from applying DEET 24/7 - this product was truly a stink bomb. The smell was so horrid, I could not bear it after my first couple of applications. And any square inch of skin that wasn't covered, the mosquitoes were able to navigate their way around to fresh blood, which means the repellent is not nearly potent enough. I usually apply repellent to sleep as well, but with this product I still woke up with bites, as it only lasts 2 hours top. Sadly I'm still on the long, hard search for a natural clean-smelling and/or scentless insect repellent."
368213,2,"I returned this epilator. I've been waxing for years but am tired of the effort & mess of at home waxing, and the expense of salon waxing. But maybe I'm spoiled and my expectations are too high. This was my first epilator. I chose this one for the wet/dry. I tried the epilator head in shower, out of shower, after shower, with soap, dry... just never got results I would expect for a device that is supposed to make my life easier. Why should I have to try so hard? I read the directions carefully, tried to get the soap exactly the consistency they recommend... and I didn't think the trimmer or shaver were that great. I have a beard trimmer I use for my bikini line which was only ten bucks which works better. I have very fine hair, so maybe epilators can't grab it. I don't know... back to waxing."

244242,1,"It's vibrating feature is a little weak, a person can stall it if he/she puts excessive pressure on it. The ""Infraded Heat"" feature does not emit enough heat in my opinion. A person needs to understand that it is not a commerical unit and you get what you pay for. I walk many, many, miles a day and it sure feels good at the end of the day having my feet massaged. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the unit."
40779,0,"Considering the price, this shaver's operation is satisfactory. It gives a reasonably close shave, but not as close as I would prefer. As an everyday utility shaver it functions fairly well. I would not use it if I were to go out to a formal function where I would need to be closely shaven. In thse instances I would use a Gillette razor."
322905,0,"I heard a lot about this smell, one of the reasons I wanted to try this shaving cream. It lathers up really well and when it lathers one the face it almost warms up a little bit. It also provides a nice cushion. I am knocking off two stars since I think the smell is not great, it smells like soap and a little medicinal. This is still better than Gillette and considering this is a relatively expensive cream (compared to Gillette, Barbasol, etc) you get what you pay for. I just ordered Speick and it's coming tomorrow. I would say it's worth a shot if your are looking at something old school, just don't expect a super modern scent."
290698,1,"I walked into the Inn at Langley lobby and immediately was struck by how good it smelled. When I discovered it was a candle I had to find out where I get one. To my surprise, I could get it at the grocery store down the street! I bought the last one and went to my room, and ordered a box of them. They last a very long time and when people walk into my home they have the same reaction I did when I walked into the Inn at Langley."
67194,0,It basically heats and vibrates. It is sort of relaxing but the constant vibration can be a bit much. You get what you pay for.
256116,0,"I bought a bottle of this stuff because people always tell me I'm crazy when I put normal cyanoacrylate glue (Yeah, superglue, crazy glue, you know the stuff) on cuts. I had heard that cyanoacrylate was used in the military during the Vietnam era on wounds, and knew from personal experience how superglue forms a hard layer very quickly on skin. And it does work very well, especially for small finger cuts where a band-aid interferes with movementHowever, apparently normal superglues produce methyl alcohol as they dry, which can kill tissue. So don't use it for wounds.This stuff is basically the same, but with a couple differences: it has an antiseptic, it's thicker, and it dries much, much slower. The first two, no big deal, but the last one makes me kinda wish I was still using normal super glue.(Please note that I am not advocating the use of crazy glue for wounds -- that is totally not FDA-approved. I just wish that this stuff dried faster.)"
248313,0,"I have had 2 of these products. They are great, and do exactly what you would expect. Except that after about 12-13 months, both of the units I have had suddenly had a meltdown, turned themselves on and would not shutoff until the battery had run out on its own. The units were completely useless after that. I have since ordered a BG2030 and happily await its arrival."
160058,0,It arrived quickly in a vinyl bag versus leather one I had a few years ago. It came off centered from zero and I can't center it accurately so it is not too helpful. Also you need another person to use it on yourself.

I like it a lot, but had I known what it actually was, I would not have purchased it.That being said, it smells wonderful and has a nice weight to it. I use it on stressful, sleepless nights to help soothe raw nerves, but I could have saved $40 and sprinkled lavender oil on my heating pad!"

115681,1,"This will be my 2nd jar of Comfrey Ointment that i've purchased for my mother. I read in a magazine that Comfrey was somehow good for back pain. She's been dealing with chronic back pain for years and years and has tried everything. Every kind of pill and ointment. My mother is the type of person who very very negative about everything and always complains that nothing works for her. But i figured i'd buy this for her to try since she's always in pain. Hey you never know right? The article i read was very adamant about this stuff working for back pain. I didnt really give it much hope though because its just a simple herb and not and actual medication. Well my mother swears by this stuff!! From the very 1st time she used it she saw a huge difference in the amount of relief she got from this product compared to all the pills and rubs she's tried over the years!! Its not a cure, but it sure does help ease her back pain considerably. I massage it in real good, then she sits back against her heating pad and feels the pain ease right away. I dont know how this stuff works, but according to my very picky, very negative mom, it works wonders for her."
349911,0,"What I like about this product is the ability to open it up and clean out the inside. It works well when you can get the opening, which is larger than other aspirators, into the baby's nose, but it's a challenge. The opening is designed to only go so far in though, an added safety benefit, but frustrating when there's a glob of snot beyond it's reach. I bought a little rubber aspirator on vacation and found it does the trick better than this product. Also, the casing and parts are bulky and take up a lot more space than the little rubber one, hence, me not bringing it on vacation."
70889,1,"Excellent.This was a gift for my husband. He has used Norelco electric razors before. Always pleased. However, this one is easier to clean and use and he finds that it gives him a truly close shave."
421714,0,"PROS: High in protein, low in sugar, enough carbs to use as a meal replacement, doesn't taste bad.CON: Very hard and chewy if refrigerated."

155288,1,"These are the best things for those middle of the night "" nature calls"" I have used them several times in my 2 person tent with no problems. It is amazing how much they hold. I am camping this summer for a week with my son's Boy Scout Troop and wouldn't consider going with out them..."
38915,0,"I used the Good News disposable razor on my legs and was pleased with the smooth, close shave. I usually use a single blade disposable and the double blade of the Good News gives a smoother shave. I think the price of these razors is rather high for a disposable -- and they don't last for as many shaves as the single edge. Overall, I was pleased and will probably buy them again if they're on sale, but they probably won't replace my regular disposable."

Yes, the Sanyos are better than alkalines = ability to be re-used, will save you money -over time, and perhaps better than a comparable (AA) size 2,000 mAh rechargeable. But I will not buy these over the 2,700 power by MAHA/ Powerex -- especially when the device is operated [continuously].- illumination was also much better w/ the 2700s in the light strands.

129741,0,"These gauze pads are only half the thickness of the J&J ones labeled as Hospital Grade Gauze Pads. I needed to use 2 for each dressing change. They are okay if you have a non draining wound and just need a cover to keep it clean. If the wound is wet or needs a moist ointment, I recommend getting the other type. I purchased them thinking I was getting so much more for the money than the hospital grade gauze pads. These come packaged 2 to a pouch, so I assume you are expected to use 2 of them at a time. If you have to use 2, they are more costly than the others. If I need large bandages in future, I will stick with the hospital grade gauze pads."

And its small enough to put in my bath vanity drawer, out of my picky wife's line of vision. What I hate: I've never had one that lasted more than 2 years. One of them crapped out at less than a year. The last one lasted the longest, so maybe they are getting better. No matter....I'll keep buying this product as long as I have real teeth....which dailey use of this thing will help with."

386886,1,"This is the green-food my body prefers...it's a powerhouse of nutrition. I've reordered from this distributer repeatedly, fast, free dilivery. One bottle lasts 3 to 6 months, so it's very affordable. Amazons' price is about 50% of retail. The powder form is pure where as the tablets contain additives. I use a 3 gram scoop once or twice aday, pure energy, nothing bad. It has a mild flavor, I mix it with (blended whole-fruit) juice, grapefruit, carrot, pineapple, celery, apple in any combinition. Anything but oranges, they promote fungas. I add bee pollen and flax seed meal to balance nutrition. Even if you have a poor diet this concoction will provide much of what you need. Together with liquid magnesium, coral calcium, sunshine and coconut oil the building blocks are all there. Be aware that differenet bodies prefer different green-food whole foods, if it makes you queasy it's not for you."

WHEN?,i wonder what the chemicals in the ahhesive were and what effcet they would take ona person's health. even after a long time IF the smell were to go away, would these chemicals remain and cause health issues.i have gone thru stage 4 cancer treatment and want no more of that. that is the worse pain i have ever gone thru and i am a tough sonofabitch. that i lived is owing to my toughness. but cancer is scary. and if these can in any way be a cause, then i want no part and take this time to warn you of your choices in this item.it may well do what it says, i will not know because i will NOT even slightly take THAT RISK.i was disappointed in spenco's attitude about this issue. oh they would have taken them back (at my expense) BUT that was not my issue nor the issue at hand. safety is the issue, and they were not concerned about that. yep, just let them air out and all will be ok.

The second day, they hurt my feet and my heels. I decided to try to keep wearing them, thinking that maybe they had to be broken in. After about five days of wearing them, my legs and feet hurt worse than they did before. I know the result was supposed to be the exact opposite -- but unfortunately it wasn't."

195732,0,I received package today with lack of 2 vibrating ring. I did count complete 48 but 10 of them are non lubricated and 38 were lubricated. do not use non lubricated one other wise you will have unpleasant baby within 9 months and you will be shocked.
379077,0,"This was given to me as a shower gift. It got lost under mountains of baby stuff, but I eventually found it while trying to pack for baby first trip. Since then, its been a staple in her diaper bag. I like that it has its own zip up case, so things don't get lost. I wouldn't recommend if for everday use b/c of some of the same complaints as other reviewers (medicine stopper, awkward thermometer).

427059,1,"If you are learning to use a straight razor or are prone to nicking when shaving, this $5 purchase will make you very happy. Like a piece of dense dissolvable chalk, you just wet the tip and touch it to the nick. It'll sting for a second but the salts will quickly seal up and dry the cut. Leaves a white residue behind so don't smear it everywhere, just a few dabs on the cut does the trick."
11465,0,"You get what you pay for with this trimmer. There is no battery indicator so you never really know how much charge is left. You also can't use it while it's plugged into the wall. It seems to charge and charge for ever. The trimmer blade is good though, with a good adjustable height that won't move on you when pressed against your face. Overall a good trimmer. It's hard to find one that is not outfitted with an unnecessary vacuum."

338597,0,"Well, I found reviews about this product awhile back when looking to find an easy way to charge more than 76 batteries every two weeks (lots of programmable candles). I ordered 1 to test, then three more. At this point, many months later, I'm down to two. One just stopped working. Not sure why, but it wouldn't charge anymore. The other one melted this weekend. It was being used as usual and I came in to see if they were done and smelled something electrical. The side was melted and hot as hell. Not sure about the batteries. I looked on Amazon's reviews and found a few that said the same thing. Not a lot but a few. Now, should they overheat and melt when used according to instructions...um...NO. I'm just happy I was watching the progress so closely or it could have ended badly. Now, am I overworking them...perhaps...but one would hope for the price, they would be able to handle it. So I will be looking for an alternative replacement to get back up to four."

I know that Echinacea is supposed to be good for colds and that's the main ingredient in this formula. I ended up taking the entire 20 capsules and it may have lessened my symptoms, but unfortunately I was still down for the count.I would recommend getting the larger 40 count size (plus it's cheaper that way) and have it on hand so you start taking it at the first sign of a cold or flu."
211399,0,"A vegan friend recommended this to me, saying it's highly nutritious and yummy. I didn't enjoy it much so I gave it to her in the end and she loves the stuff.So if you like this kinda stuff and are vegan it may be a good product for you."
254100,0,its very stronge.It would be nice if the cord was longer.i do feel like this massager is made to last longer than most at this price range.
168286,2,"I brought this 4 my partner and I, so we could try. I honestly did not like the product very much, it did nothing for my partner and I, the vibrationations were weak, we had to use my vibrator to get the sensation we wanted."
222195,0,I have a big ol booty so I didn't find this to be the best fit for my body type. Then to top it off the remote is in a rather uncomfortable spot. The heat is in the lower back. I don't use it. The vibration is strong and steady. It gets a little boring/numbing after about 10 minutes. One naughty benefit that surprised me was that this massager vibrates your crotch really well because of the location of the seat vibes. I chose to fold up the seat cushion for a stronger lower back vibration. That provides good lower back support too. So I don't exaclty use the massager as was intended but I made do. I have had better massagers but this one it not to bad.For the price it does the trick.
327976,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
269894,0,"It is a great product, but I wish it was in the glass bottle. How come it is organic cranberry and in plastic? Other than that, it is good."
23877,0,"As a deodorant, it does do its job -- no complaints, and the scene it not overbearing. My biggest complaint is that shortly after you put it on, its starts flaking everywhere. Case in point, I went to the doctor, and needed to take my shirt off. Once my shirt and undershirt came off, I have deodorant flakes flying all over the place from my pits. I had only put this on about 30 minutes prior, and there is goes flaking everywhere. It doesnt matter how much you put on, it just ends of flaking, and its nasty. My other complaint is that some of the scents are way too powerful like clean slate, and its smell like you dumped a bottle of cologne on even if you only put a little. I really recommend trying something else because I am."
148124,0,"I am a mascara FREAK, so I just had to try Diorshow after all the hype it's been getting. It is a pretty good mascara, and the floral scent is nice, but it's really not that amazing. I think my good old Maybelline Full N Soft does the best job of any mascara out there. Diorshow is fun to try once, but I'm not dropping $23 everytime I need new mascara."
3990,0,"$3.50 every time you change blades is just insane. May I recommend Gillette's 'Good News Pivot Plus with Lubrastrip' 12 pack for 50 cents each. And there's a guy selling Platinum double-edge blades on ebay for fifteen cents. A lot of people think these things are better than the Fusion /or/ the Pivot. Lots of hype, but Gillette has gone backwards in the past fifty years in my opinion. I will say one thing: the Pivot Plus is a marvel of plastics technology and quality control. It gives a pretty good shave, but not as good as the double-edges I used as a kid."
258113,0,"I originally bought this product with the intent to use it with p90x, as a supplement for some muscle growth. I must say its a very interesting product because when you first taste it, its probably the greatest tasting protein powder you could imagine. I mean, i seriously could probably just eat the stuff straight up without even mixing it with anything. Now, this isn't necessarily a GOOD thing you see, because when you look at the package there are absolutely no amounts of sugar leaving a huge question mark as to how this is.After a few weeks of using it i must say things stuff isn't good at all regardless of taste. I get seriously horrible digestion problems after i consume the stuff. I bought a two pound tub and i must say i fully regret it beyond the fact that i learned that i will never buy a product similar to this one again, if i were you i would HIGHLY suggest trying the product in a smaller amount(not even sure if they sell it in a smaller amount than 2 lbs) to make sure that the stuff doesn't make you feel horrible. With all that said, i would just like everyone who reads this to know: BE WEARY OF WHAT GOES INTO YOUR BODY and buy natural instead."
76142,0,"i believe this is just a mixture of vitamins that would be equivalent to a multivitamin. if you look at the ingredients closely, the only added are vitex, chasteberry, etc. i think this might help couples with mild to no conditions of conceiving. we tried this for a few months and it didn't work. when i spoke to my infertility physician, she said it works the same way as taking a multivitamin and some other supplements. the bottle is quite costly."
367667,0,"I know it takes awhile to break in and get used to a new shaver, so all I can say at the moment is ""so far so good."" I did have a problem initially, even after fully charging, getting the ""on"" button to stay on without continuing to press it but that seems to have worked itself out."

83322,0,"I really like this food based calcium but had not noticed that it has a ton of magnesium. It works for anyone not needing more than 500mg of calcium a day (three pills) but if you need to take 1,500mg, you'll be taking ways too much magnesium (3,000 mg/day) and you will probably spend your days in the toilet. I had to change back to Rainbow light regular calcium which does not have enough magnesium per serving, so back again to adding separate magnesium pills."
176439,1,"Good price. I use this in combination with 5htp, a multi, fish oil, and ginko. I use the combo to treat depression, and I think the combo has greatly improved my mood."

103131,0,"The toothbrush sanitizer seems to work well, but could stand improving. Thereis no cover (or lid) for the unit, so why bother to sanitize if your toothbrushremains ""open"" to dust, etc? I went to the hardware store and purchased a plasticcover that sits over the toothbrush area, but would definitely recommend that atight-fitting cover be included with the unit."
61199,0,I tried to cancel this order hours after I placed it. The company I dealt with did not get back to me for three days after I cancelled and said they were too busy to cancel and shipped product anyway. I felt that they just didn't want to cancel order to make there money. I will probably not use amazon again. I gave the prodcut a 3 but the company and amazon a Minus Five Star!
160233,0,"So I'll be honest, we bought these due to the cheap price and, since they do exactly what they're advertised to do, I can't be too mad... but I will say I can only have them in my ears for about 30 seconds until the pain it causes in my ear from the hard plastic pressing hard against the bone/cartilage is too much to bear... these things are the most uncomfortable pair I've ever tried... but again, they work well so if you're looking for price and functionality versus comfort, these are perfect."
271514,0,"arrived on time and well packaged. container is nice. not totally impressed with this product. won't buy again anytime soon,"
301523,0,"Having collected a bunch of mismatched plastic over the years, I liked the idea of an easy to store system. As far as that goes, it's good. For day to day use it is fine and serves it's purpose. I did end up saving some of my larger old stuff, because none of the ""smart store"" containers are very large.I did crack one when I dropped it full of food, so there are higher quality plastics out there. This won't take a lot of abuse. The main drawback is that the way the lids fit, if you do drop one, it is almost guaranteed to pop the top off and spill."
146944,0,I am not too crazy about this product yet. I have not been taking it long enough to make a well determined call on if it is working or not yet.
334577,0,I purchased this because my parent has parkinsons. She is very weak and has little control over her legs. She has great difficulty getting in and out of the passenger seat of a car. I thought this would help but she is unable to make it turn. She weighs only 100 pounds and her legs are too weak to push on the flooring and make the seat turn.I personally tried it and can see how anyone with some leg strength would benifit by having it.
98668,0,"I purchased these Pec Pads based on the reviews read here, but when I used them with a cleaning solution that I already had, all I got was streaks on my lenses and LCD. I am going to reserve bad judgment until I receive my new order of Eclipse Solution.They are really lint free though."
20624,0,18 months per set is impossible. These need to be replaced every 6-8 months to maintain the quality of shave. My screen wore through in 8 months.This is probably the most expensive shaving system on the market.
56528,0,"The taste of this product was a little better than other Balance Bars but there's still kind of a """"chemical"""" aftertaste and I'd prefer more of a crunchy bar than the texture of these. But if you need a quick snack this isn't bad -- especially for those on the go."
286144,1,"I know, it's not what it is for. But I reached the end of my rope with my bathroom sink. I have a slow drain and I swear I used every freaking thing to clear it. I even pulled apart all the pipes to discover the problem is in the main line. But none of the main line products worked and plumber's wanted both my arm, leg, and first born child. I don't have kids so I couldn't afford it :-)So I have been working on it myself, using a wide variety of tools and chemicals. I think only Timothy Leary tried more chemicals than me. With very different results.Anyway, while shopping for my next attempt I saw a lone bottle of CLR. When I read what it cleans I thought, why not?I just poured it down the drain and was amazed! Instead of filling to the top and just sitting there it went straight down. I figured it was a fluke so I filled the sink with water. It did back up a little but then it went down quickly. The drain still needs a little help so I am buying two more bottles.BTW, it also cleaned the top of the drain which had been discolored from my mad scientist approach to plumbing."
344557,0,I found this in smaller size cheaper in the long run at Walmart. I wish I would have known this before.
56557,0,I felt that this product was a good alternative for nutrition on the go. It would be nice to eat a fast bar when you're rushing out the door rather than skip an entire meal. The taste was acceptable. It wasn't like eating a candy bar but it wasn't terrible either. I haven't tried other nutritional bars so I really don't have anything to compare these to. I did feel that this was an interesting product and it definitely has its place in today's fast-paced world.
213834,0,"I have had similar Wahl shaver products in the past and this seems the weakest of the bunch. At first I thought the battery was not charged all the way when I first turned it on, but it had all the charge it was going to get! Not great, but it gets the job done. Nice depth/length adjustment, though. Smaller blade on other side that swivels around, but is basically useless. I have actually paid less for other Wahl trimmers and had more speed/power and a light! Not great!"
404878,2,"I ordered a gallon of this liquid..... and was sent only 1/2 gallon. I know specifically I clicked on the one gallon. Anyway I would have never spent 17.00 with shipping and handling on that little of an amount. Customer service denied that is what I ordered and of course I have revisited this site and the problem has been corrected. I have used this aloe ""miracle product"" and I was not impressed. I found a better alternative at the Xmas tree store in the health food isle for 5.99 with much better results. Plus I didnt have to pay for any shipping cost. I will NEVER buy another product from these clowns again."
36417,0,"I love the design of this type of brace. I have pretty chronic ankle issues and the strap system prevents my ankle from rolling when playing sports. I have used this type of brace before (from another manufacturer) and this one isn't as good for a couple reasons. 1) The materials are a little to stiff (both the straps and the laces). Mind you, this design doesnt need the materials to be stiff for support. That is all accomplished by virtue of the straps being there. The extra stiffness just makes the laces unwieldy and the fit more abrasive (ie. blisters on my achilles). 2) I think the velcro on the straps should be lower on the straps. because of where the velcro is, only a small portion of the velcro makes a connection with the other half on my ankle. The rest is left flopping in the wind above my ankles and the brace. If my foot was 2 inches wider, it would hit in the right spot. SUMMARY: it gets the job done, but not as well as it could/should."
43749,0,"Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSenseThe monitor functions well, however, the accuracy when compared to the readings obtained at the Doctors office with a mercury sphygmomanometer is off by about twenty points.

395324,0,"This is great fish oil. Unfortunately, I purchased this for my dog who has skin problems and is allergic to salmon oil. What the ad doesn't tell you is that it is orange flavored. Great for people, but my dog, not so much. I am adding it to my shakes now which is great for me, but I had to find something else for my dog. I would give it 5 stars for quality but had to give it 3 because the ad doesn't contain ALL of the info."

234175,0,"Just a fair warning I noticed after two weeks of use one of batteries had leaked in my game camera. I know that it happens from time to time with batteries, but still disappointed. It's not going to prevent me from buying them again, but it will be in the back of my mind.EDIT - after posting, I read some other reviews to see if I was alone, and no surprise, I wasn't. A leaky battery is not uncommon, and is an easy fix. If caught early, you can prevent any damage to the device. It's an easy fix and can be found all over google. It took me all of five minutes of cleaning and a few hours of drying to get my camera back up and running. I tested it by running it a day in my house, and didn't notice a problem."

246758,1,"This unit works well, it started producing steam within minutes of being connected to a power source. We are on a well and did not have to add salt to the water.

I like this bowl, just not exactly what I had hoped for."

321038,2,my son hated this product. kids will try it once and they will not want to take it again. you cannot hide it in other drinks it is too strong to do that. I didn't see any improvement in his sleep habits either.
404671,0,This is an OK product especially for the price but nothing to get too excited about. You have to take more than the recommended dosage to feel it working.
291706,0,"I love the colors for this set. All the items seem to be of good quality. My only complaint is that I have a difficult time hearing with the stethoscope.

Plus the everything fits nicely in the carry bag."

I've since developed new food allergies and I can't for the life of me find an ingredient list on Amazon's page. You'd think for advertising Allergen-Free, they'd want to make the ingredients as clear as possible so that people with allergies can make their own sound decisions. Sure, I can probably dig up the list online somewhere, but when I'm comparing and contrasting with other products on Amazon.com, I want it clear and spelled out in the product description. Disappointed."
246972,0,"It took 3 weeks to receive the item. However the few weeks in use, it seems to serve its' purpose. It was purchased for my dad. My mother(who is 65+) chose to assemble herself. She said she had no issues putting it together and likes the item for him."

415313,0,"Having interchangeable heads is a good idea. The handle and heads are easy to clean after use. As well, they all seem to work fine. the only complaint I have is the base that holds the handle is too ""flimsy"". The charger connector has to be positioned just right and inserted in the stand just so, so as to charge the handle in that base. It's too light and is difficult to set on a countertop. It is probably easier to just plug the chord connector directly into the handle lay the handle on the countertop and bypass the base altogether."

75328,1,I really like these. Have one every morning for breakfast. They have fiber and protein so they keep me full and they are quick and easy to grab as I walk out the door.

I liked the double-sided diaphragm gadget since it was useful for babies through adults. However, the diaphragm on the smaller side broke after a 1-2 years of use. I bought another one to replace the first and had the same problem with the smaller diaphragm breaking/becoming useless. Recently the rubber tubing broke and now I can't hear a thing. I've had it for about 3 years. I'm thinking of switching brands or maybe downgrading to a less expensive model for my next one."

205616,0,"The ingredient list is great, good amount of protein and fiber with great whole food ingredients which is why I gave it 3 stars. To say that this is an ""acquired"" taste is somewhat of an understatement.

Anyone got any ides on how to doctor this thing up to avoid a gag reflex?"
324284,0,I bought this for the dressing hooks and wide round foam handle. Which has been wonderful. I did not need the shoe horn. But when I went to use it the shoe horn fell out every time. Instead of gluing it in I tossed it. But the dressing hooks are the best!! The rubber tipped one does not slide off of clothing and that is a significant plus.
222482,0,One problem with the exerciser: you have to back your chair against a wall and weigh down each end of the exerciser (I use 15lb weights) so that you stay in place. But it is possible to get exercise from this little bicycle especially when recovering from a knee replacement. Good for arm exercise (place exerciser on a table) too during physical therapy for arms and sholders. I found Amazon to be the best price.

48869,0,"I bought this to help with my facet syndrome in my lumbar spine. When I can get it to stay in place, it's wonderful. Unfortunately, that involves manually placing it in the correct position after I sit in the chair, because the strap that attaches this to the chair is worthless. It's made of incredibly stretchy elastic, which means that it moves out of place as soon as minute pressure is applied. Even worse, the plastic buckle does not hold the strap in place at all. So every time I stand up, the support falls down onto the chair seat.Granted, I have a curvy-backed chair which is not ideal for this kind of attachment, but I think the strap was really under-designed, which is a shame."

145862,1,"This is the first electronic toothbrush I've ever used, and let me tell you, the first time I used it, it was definitely a wierd feeling; almost like the feeling you get when you get your teeth cleaned from the dentist (my tongue constantly runs over my teeth, just like after I get my teeth professionaly cleaned). A close friend of mine is a Dental Hygenist and she recommended this to me. She uses it, because ""it's the closest thing to having your teeth professionaly cleaned"". The key thing behind this is the amount of brush strokes; the force you feel doesn't matter, but the repetition is what does the job. ""I use mentadent toothpaste, and don't want to change"", was the first thing I said before I got this. I have 2 bridges in my mouth, and was told that this is 100% safe and recommended for all people with dental work done. (...), everyone in the family can use it; just get them each their own head. Also, listen to recommendation about changing the head every 6 months, a worn head just isn't as effective."

Useless product and since I bought them awhile back but didn't wear them until now, I missed the return window. Amazon should make it easier to contact the manufacturer regarding defects in products they sell via their website.UPDATE: After reading more about the thigh highs, I realized that the problem was that my husband unwittingly put them in the dryer. I followed the cleaning instructions and washed the silicone part with woolite and thankfully today they stayed up fine. phew. was worried it was money down the drain. i also tried the jobst thigh highs that are the next level up as i was wanting a bit more compression but they didn't feel like they compressed much and felt bunchy around the back of the knees. at least these don't bunch in funny places.

150631,0,"First off, I wanted to say I am not a fan of artificially sweetened foods. I cannot stand the after taste. This tastes like things that are artificially sweetened - overly sweet going down and leaves an after taste of sorts. Yuck! Weird, since the label reads ""No artificial flavors or sweeteners"". Amazon lists fructose as a sweetener. But upon further reading of other users' reviews, I see some mentioned Stevia as a sweetener. Really? Well, if that's the case, why did Optimum Nutrition not mention this in their ingredients list? Had I known, I would not have purchased this product. I've never tasted Stevia, but now I know it stands with those disgusting artificially sweetened crap the industry likes to pump out.The ingredients label on my 5-lb container reads: Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolates, Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey Peptides), Cocoa (Processed with Alkali), Lecithin, Natural Flavor, Xanthan Gum, Rebaudioside A, Aminogen, Lactase.Why do manufacturers feel they have to artificially sweeten our food? Or just as bad, add disgusting tasting ""natural"" sweeteners that do nothing but mimic artificial sweeteners. The cloying sweet taste and bad after taste that coats one's tongue is not appealing to me whatsoever. Never mind it not being chocolate-y at all. But my beef is more with how it is sweetened as that was my main interest when purchasing this product.Update: I had emailed ON regarding how this was sweetened and here's their response:ON response --> The sweeteners used in the Natural Gold Standard are evaporated cane juice powder and reboudioside A (which is a sweet component of stevia). These are both natural sweeteners. If you are more interested in an unflavored protein, we do have a product called Any Whey.Huh, I just learned something. I must say, they have great customer service because they responded very quickly. I am impressed."

106676,2,Pros. Ergonomic design. Quite operation. Easy clean up with soap and water.Cons. No cord for shaving when the battery is dead. Inadequate performance for long bear growth or course beard hair.If you shave daily and don't have course beard hair this shaver will likely be a keeper.

263392,1,"It appears to me that the majority of people rating fewer than 4 or 5 stars here are doing so because of the taste of this product, which is highly subjective as I found it to actually be the tastiest whey product I have tried even amongst others of this same brand (Dymatize). This is a ""pure"" protein product - no carbs, no fillers, minimal fat and cholesterol, added glutamine and other amino acids and all at a terrific price (around $36 USD at the time of this writing for the subscription). To boot, I have found that this brand digests much easier than other wheys I have used - and I have been using protein supplements on and off for about 10 years now. No gas, no bloating - makes a stomach (and those around you) happy :-)."
301828,0,"I do realize that this is a trimmer and not a razor. I did not expect to get that bare skin feeling. With that being said, I feel like this trimmer is only for those with, dare I say it, a bush. I experience a lot of irritation with shaving (after 6 laser treatments no less) and still get quite a few ingrowns/razor rash in certain places. I purchased this to keep those areas short but not shaved so I wouldn't have to worry about irritation and bumps. The shortest setting on this trimmer is 1/8"" but it does not get hair down that length. I could see where this could plow through a large quantity of longer hair quite well but it simply didn't work for someone with less hair that was about 1/2""-1/4"" to begin with. That's just too much hair for my preference."

126422,0,"A very nice scent, for me; nicely balanced, smooth and nonsynthetic.A real pleaser when it is working for me. Very nice.I would truly love it if it held up closer to what I get from several otherproducts at this price point (>5 hours with decent taper off projection).It is too problematic for me to start off with an extra heavy application orneed to reinforce it every 2-3 hours or so, which seems to be the case here.It also has a very heavy burn rate, given it's poor longevity.Side by side it just expires way too quickly and it wasn't a fake either(unless fakes have penetrated top shelf department stores/not likely).Sadly I needed to move on as I just couldn't get comfortable with carryingaround a mini atomizer or sample bottle, nor did I want to go without. A ladymight carry their mobile supply where I just can't be that dependant and prissy.It will fade fast for you too, bet on it. If thats OK I'd say go for it."
329698,0,"This idea, the cordless sweeper, has been a great invention for those of us with non-carpeted flooring that seems to show every spec of dirt or hair. While all models out there have the basic four sweeper brushes that do a good job of picking up dirt, a tray to empty, and a rechargeable battery, the overall disappointment with this is the Ni-Cad battery it uses. This translates to low usage time since it doesn't last more than a week of casual use on a full charge, a gradual loss of sweeping power (similar to a handheld vac when the battery is dying) so that the remaining power is too weak to be useful yet you risk ""memory"" damage if you recharge it. Consquently, when it is losing the battery power, you have to sit it in a corner to let it die out completely, then set it on the charger. My particularly battery was utterly useless after less than 6 months. I had regular usage of my hardwood floors and I cannot find a replacement battery, even on the manufacturers website. This would be a great product if not for the battery issue."

257945,1,"Bought this unit to clean up after our 2 year old. I cannot believe how muddy the return tank was after. The floor was mopped (swiffer) just a day before it arrived but we wanted to know how well this performs. I got this for the sole purpose of wet cleaning and I do have a stick vac next to it for dry pickups. It is lighter and easier to move around.I like the extra long cord. I wired extra outlets inside the my laundry room and kept the floormate and stick vac plugged in and ready to use.I do notice that a small amount of water leaks out each time you remove the tanks. So expect a little puddle each time you empty them. We keep them in the laundry room with the tanks at least half full of the floor cleaner to keep it ready and it does not leak while in storage.Beyond these minor nuances, I would recommend this unit. It definitely cleans better than any mop. The squeegee dries the floor out completely except where you stop (leaks). So just have some paper towels in your pocket and you will be fine. Wiping off a puddle is easier than walking all over a damp hardwood floor anytime."
426467,0,"Bilberry....it sounded so...so....tasty. I am sure that this tea is good for your health and for that reason I give it the 3 stars. Unfortunately, it smells and tastes like fish which is something I just cannot tolerate. I tried it several times and just could not drink it. I have a close friend who is Asian and she likes it, but she eats a lot of fish sauce so I guess her tastebuds are adapted to that taste. Not mine. I would also say that I am not a finicky eater (I do eat fish), and I do tolorate a lot of tastes for the sake of eating healthy, including eating things on the bitter side - but 'fishy' is hard for me to swallow! So, for now, I will have to try something else. Anyone know what hawthorn berry tea taste like?"

189355,0,"I purchased this in order to have something to add to juices while I'm recovering from surgery. The flavor is mild enough in frozen fruit smoothies and juices, but it's not as easy to stir as other reviews have made it out to be. It takes putting it in a blender for me to get it past being little chunks in liquid. It's filling, which is all I need from it for now, and the flavor is good for the flexibility in choice as opposed to having full containers of either straight chocolate or vanilla."
161957,0,"Have purchased two of these in the past 3 years. Each runs as advertised, but each one has had electrical problems. I think this stems from the fact that when I am finished shaving, I wrap the cord around the base for storage. After time (about 1 1/2 years in each case), the electrical connection from wire to the guts inside gets faulty resulting in the machine not turning on. But, because the price is good, I will run out and buy another."

164923,0,"These are fine, thick and lasting rubber gloves. One real problem though: their sizes are overstated. I always used Rubbermaid large gloves that I bought in our local CVS. They were really comfortable. Recently they disappeared, so when I bumped into Playtex equivalent in a grocery store, I picked a pair. They were marked as ""large"" and yet I could barely pull them over my hands (and I don't really have such big hands to begin with), and then they were extremely uncomfortable as the gloves squeezed my hands too hard and impeded movement and circulation). I tortured myself a couple of days and then tossed them. Three bucks down the drain (they cost slightly more here, for some reason... you'd expect online prices to be better?).Do not rely on the markings with this brand: these gloves are probably as ""large"" as Rubbermaid's small ones. Either get to try them on before buying, or be safe and buy extra large (still smaller than Rubbermaid's large). Good quality gloves (five-stars), but mislabelled sizes, so beware. Three stars on that account."

261027,0,"This was the fragrance for myself and other pre-teen girls during the late 80's early 90's--while we were still into pop rock. Anybody who wanted to be 'in' had to wear this scent.It is best described as fruity with a hint of floral. According to the commercial jingle, the wearer is supposed to come away feeling like they are a 'california babe' who will have boys swarming all over her at the sun-drenched beach merely as a result of wearing the product. And in an example of good timing, the original 90210 which had rich California teenagers hanging out and dating at (among other locations) a beach, debuted during this same time span. Advertisments for this perfume ran HEAVILY during the show.The perfume company makes other scents, but I'm sure that this was one of their best sellers. It knew it's audience and how to successfully market the product.I personally had wasted my allowance on endless bottles of this stuff. This was in part because I hadn't yet mastered the concept of 'less is more' particularly when it came to perfume aplication.I then found out that after a while its strong scent cancelled out the 'upscale' experience which we were supposed to have while wearing it. So I just came away with a headache from my self-inflicted overspray.Honestly delighted to see they are still making it, I recomend that potential wearers/wearers use a microscopic amount. A VERY little of this stuff will go a long way."
357391,0,"I believe supplements work. I take a number of other supplements regularly, and try to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, and was looking forward to trying out this Holy Basil. Unfortunately, after taking them as directed on the package for 30 days, I noticed no effects -good or bad- at all. Sometimes that happens. I have yet to find something that works the same for everybody, and they seem to work well for others here, but I can only comment on my own experience. For what it's worth, as I mentioned above I also did not experience any negative effects either, such as bad taste or indigestion from the capsules and found them easy to swallow. Herbal supplements can sometimes be hit and miss, and though these didn't work for me, I am hesitant to rate this product at anything less than neutral, because I do believe they do work for others."
2965,0,"Well, I must agree with those who said (for the shaver that wasn't factory reconditioned) that this shaver is mediocre. I bought the refurbished one at $22 and it is worth that, but not a penny more. It does not give a close shave without going over your face several times. My Norelco worked this well when the blades were 8 years old!I admit, I usually had to shave twice with the Norelco, but the Remington is not nearly that good. To get a decent shave, I have to press pretty hard and go over each area several times. I end up with a bit of redness from the pressing that I have to do to get the shaver to work reasonably well.If you're buying a shaver for $40, save your money and find a Norelco that's on sale."
178186,0,"This is a cute little toy that you can use for the first few days of the baby's life. The endless feedings make you wonder when you last fed and changed your baby, and in fact whether it's day or night! You can play with this lo-tech gadget during those first few sleepless nights. When everything is a mystery those first few days, it's interesting to see how far apart the baby's diaper changes were and to make sure you are feeding them from a different side than last time. But frankly, after a few days with your baby, you will know when they're ready to eat (in fact, many paediatricians will recommend demand, rather than timed, feeding after the baby is back to their birth weight) and you will be checking your baby's diaper all the time anyway. Unless you plan on feeding and changing your baby on a timer, this product has limited use. Cute idea for sure, but another gadget that I probably could have done without!"

Other than that it is a good product, the little light it has helps a lot, and it does its job well."

The arch support is situated more to the middle of my sole and back towards the heel.

24642,0,"I think that Zantrex-3 works exactly as it should. No, you are not going to take the pill, continue to eat as you normally do, and magically lost weight. If anyone finds a pill that does that, please let me know. Basically, Zantrex-3 is a caffeine pill. Sure, it says it contains all kinds of really impressive-sounding ingredients, but it boils down to a caffeine pill. And caffeine pills can and do work for weight loss in the sense that they suppress your appetite and give you a boost of energy. So, this pill can give you that extra edge a lot of us need to lose weight, but it absolutely must be used in moderation and along with exercise and proper diet to work right. Can it make you feel nervous or jittery? Yes, just like drinking 5 cups of coffee could. I suggest following the instructions and taking the pills with a lot of water 15-30 minutes before eating. I would only recommend taking no more than 4 pills a day (though I believe the bottle says you can take up to 6). Four pills should be plenty to get you through your day. The bottom line is not to expect some miracle with this pill, or any pill for that matter. It can give you an extra edge and assist with weight loss, but nothing will just magically make extra weight disappear without exercise and a proper diet."

In between ordering this Mini set from Amazon and actually receiving the package, I found one of my full-sized Tweezerman tweezers and have been using that the last few days. (I pluck stray eyebrows every morning while doing my makeup, so they don't get out of hand.) When the Mini arrived just now, I went upstairs to test it out, and unfortunately it just doesn't grip as well as the bigger pair. Several times on fine blonde hairs I had to really fight to get this one to grip it, and after about ten hairs, I went back to the full-sized and got all the stray hairs. So, this is pretty much a waste of my money; by the time I send it back to Amazon, the refund would be minimal, so I guess I'll keep it for emergencies - such as the next time the big pair gets lost!"
427626,0,"I didn't care for this chlorophyl liquid as much as some others I tried. The mint flavor was nice, not too overpowering, and strong enough to keep it from tasting like liquid grass. However, it was rather salty also (I noticed the sodium content was much higher than some other brands I've tried) so I ended up using up the rest of this bottle for my dogs (I add a capful to their water bowl daily). I will say that a friend of mine tried this and one other one I had that were saltier and liked the saltiness of them, and actually preferred them to the ones I liked best--so you may well like it if you like salt!"
340322,1,"I've owned my Zero gravity chair for 8 months now. I purchased it used from Craigslist for much less than what the retail stores offer, and it's been in both my living room and now my reading room. I'm 28 years old and although I have some back pain, I don't suffer from some of the major ailments that other people are describing.That being said, this is the most comfortable chair I've ever owned or sat in. When your in the zero gravity position, it's very hard not to fall asleep it's so comfortable. To read or watch tv, I'll usually sit 15 degrees or so heigher, and this is also incredibly comfortable. The chair really does remove stress off of your back and legs, as well as your beer stomach ( which I'm growing). I also love the neck and lumbar pillows.I personally have had no issues around the chair not having a footpad. I'm 6ft tall and although my feet are slightly off the bottom of the chair, it honestly makes no difference to me since I'm normally passed out asleep.I think that anybody who's interested should go to a retail store for a long testing of the chair, but they should then look online for other potentially used options. The manual chair has no moving parts, so no real need to worry about warranty issues, and my chair was 2yrs old and used when I got it. I did notice a slight drop in the padding, but it was very minimal.Even if you end up paying the $1700 or so for a chair at the stores, it is very well worth it, and will go a great deal in alleviating pains, as well as providing deep relaxation."
247628,0,"Purchased the product thinking that it would be significantly redesigned to handle body hair differently than any other razor (manual or electric) that I currently own. Bottom line is it doesn't and, as others have noted, constant cleaning is needed to keep performance at an acceptable level. Overall, okay, but not great."

74343,0,"I bought these diapers for my 17 month old daughter. I'm not overly impressed with them so far. They are nice and absorbent and easy to use. The extra-long, attached insert is easy to use...you just double it over in the diaper. They wash and dry nicely.However, there are some things I do not like about these. They are rather bulky and I don't see how they would work well with a newborn. I also discovered that they will leak depending on what clothing my daughter is wearing. If she's wearing a one piece outfit or sleeper, they do not leak. If she is wearing something like jeans that pull up in the crotch area...the diaper will leak out of the sides. The leg openings don't seem to be fitted enough.I wouldn't buy any more of these. I like the Bumgenius, Happy Heiny's or Haute Pockets much better."
257181,0,"The title says it all. I purchased the Pineapple Orange Banana and was surprised at how easily it mixed. The smell reminded me of that orange anti-biotic I took as a child (which I linked because of its sweetness) and while the initial taste was similar, the after taste was potent; not matatlic or gritty, just not in harmony with the inital taste. I was able to drink it but I am worried about getting through the remaining three pounds of it. As for the consistency, it was smooth and only slightly thicker than water...almost like an after work-out drink. Definitely not thick and gloopy like some of the other mixes on the market."
316668,0,We bought this sound machine 9 months ago when our daughter was born. We've used it approx. 2 hours each day since buying it and it has worked as we intended it: To create a sleep environment for our baby to nap. The only problem is that now it is starting to short out. Nothing is more jarring than a sudden stop to white noise. And sometimes it goes on and off on its own. I'm disappointed that it is failing now and won't be purchasing another HoMedics product.

It simply will not stay on. It would be an easy fix by the manufacturer, but this product is clearly manufactured as cheaply as possible. The trimmer feels very cheap and light which makes me question its long-term durability. Other inexpensive trimmers like this received mediocre reviews as well, so I bought this based on one review and the reputation of the Wahl name brand. It seems to work fine for limited purposes but the battery cover and cheap design keep me from giving an enthusiastic endorsement."
179446,0,"Soex Herbal Hookah Tobacco is good, depending on the smoker's preferences. For starters, this alternative product contains no tobacco so it is free of nicotine and tar. If your goal is a healthier smoke, Soex may satisfy. While nobody seems sure of what ugarsay anecay agassebay is, this main ingredient seems to be derived from sugar cane. While we are to assume that it's safer than tobacco, there have been no studies to verify such a claim. The packaging is exquisite as it comes with two convenient resealable bags and four inside style mouth pieces. The given flavor comes through well and the smoke is surprisingly thick. The flavor is filled with molasses and what tastes like glycerin. For traditional hookah smokers, this will seem like a lite smoke. As expected, it lacks the buzz and overall 'mojo' of tobacco based shishas. For this reason, it may have special value for those taking their first journey into the world of the hookah. Reviewer Matthew Dickens wrote about how this is such a fantastic value. It's really not, especially when the $7.30 shipping charge brings the total up to $16.29. If you shop around on the Internet, the same 150 gram packages can be found for less. That written, the price is comparable to what's out there and the buyer gets the benefits of package tracking. In addition, the featured stock photo is misleading since it shows much larger packages. See the product's image gallery for my scaled photo of 150 grams of Soex. As a whole, I'm glad that ""Deals in Motion"" turned me onto a new shisha experience. Regardless of personal preferences, I believe that the availability of a non-tobacco based shisha is long overdue. While it's not for everybody, Soex is worth a try."

I would recommend this to anyone as it seams to be one of the few colognes that work with all chemistry types. Spray a sample and walk around the mall, I bet you will get many compliments. =)Update...After trying many other types of cologne I have decided that this is my favorite and I do not think that the smell will ever get old, it is so pleasant that I never get any complaints even when I am around people that hate to smell cologne and that makes it worth every penny since I have quite a few people around me that are allergic and they make it known if they think that something smell too strong. There is only one other and you will find it in my other reviews....With colognes I usually buy from Amazon direct or the manufacturer only!"

25977,0,"I bought this mask because sunlight streaming across my eyelids tells my brain it is time to GET UP!! In summer that can be 5:30 or 6:00 on a Saturday morning. Something clearly had to be done about that- and I thought this mask might be the answer.The way that this mask fits on my face results in a light leak around my nose. When I tighten the band that goes around my head the light leak disappears but the mask smashes my nose a bit and compresses my nostrils- making it hard to breathe. It is too much to ask that a mask like this fit every face- and it clearly wasn't designed for mine.I have come to the conclusion that room darkening window shades will work for me better than this mask. It also is a bit awkward when you attempt to sleep on your side with the mask on.It's a good thing the ear plugs are a free gift because they proved ineffective and useless.Maybe there might be a way to design this mask with no light leaks- and also in a way that did not press against your nose, effectively half closing your nostrils?"

11156,0,"First off, this is the first silicone-based lubricant I have tried, and I have to say I have mixed feelings about it. I was expecting it to be more slippery, but it turned out to allow almost a pleasurable amount of friction without being dry. My expectations with trying silicone lube was that it would last much longer than water-based lubes. My only complaint is that it seems to dry out (or be absorbed) too fast (which is what I was trying to avoid with the switch to silicone). When reconstituted with water or saliva it becomes really slippery again, more so than KY or Astroglide. It seems like just your standard KY stays slippery as long as this does. I'll have to try the Wet Platinum next time."
42164,0,"I've been trying a few AIO cloth diapers on my 1 month old daughter, and this is trial diaper 3 of 3. I am happy with the quality of construction and materials. My only gripe is with the amount of snaps and the time it takes to figure out which one goes where to ensure a proper fit. I'm not an idiot; I just would prefer something easier. My very intelligent engineer husband (who thinks I'm crazy for wanting to cloth diaper in the first place...) is even less likely to want to figure out how to use them. I would recommend the Bum Genius AIO diaper over this one--they have the same quality (with a touch of velcro), but I think are easier to use. I hope this helps."

161278,0,"I bought the GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit as a starter for my at-home waxing alternative to paying the big bucks at the salon. The kit offered a lot of product at a good deal money-wise. I got all of the basic necessities: wax, wax warmer, spatulas, and then some. However, when I used the products as recommended, it only broke the hair off--leaving stubble. The kit comes with soft wax for sensitive skin, so maybe that wax wasn't right for what I was doing. Overall, I was impressed by the deal but dissappointed by its use."
53231,1,"My sister originally recommended the 4 series to me (in 1999) because she had to have skin grafts because of excessive brushing, which I also tend to do. This series was recommended to her by her oral surgeon. This is now the second Sonicare 4 series I have owned. The first was purchased in late 1999 and had finally developed a small crack in the frame. Needless to say, I didn't want a different model because of the longevity of my first one. My only dissatisfaction is caused by something I missed when picking this replacement. My first Sonicare 4 series paused slightly every 30 seconds as an alert to change from upper to lower, and also front to behind. It ran for a total of two minutes. This newer model runs for a total of two minutes, but doesn't pause every 30 seconds to let you know to change position. I am now using a stopwatch which is a little bit of a pain first thing in the morning, but otherwise okay. I just wish that I had paid closer attention to the item details before making the purchase. I don't know if the 4 series still offers the 30 second pause function, and if it doesn't, I don't know that I would have paid more than $20 extra for the function to get one of the newer series. This may be of no issue to anyone else, but I just bring it up for former 4 series owners who expect the same functionality."

419563,1,Gillette has always made the top of the line razors since I was old enough to shave. The Mach 3 has become my personal favorite. It gives me a closer shave than anything else and it's durable. I don't like the plastic handled razors a lot of other brands produce. This is solid top to bottom. The multiple blades make sure I'm able to get each hair down as close to my skin as possible. I like a clean shaven face and it's important to have one for work. I don't have as much facial hair as some of my friends so I use it every other day and it does the trick for me. The blades last me on average about 2 months which is great as well.Occassionally I'll try to stretch out the use on a blade and it'll be too dull and I'll have some razor burn. It happens to everyone at some point. When I run into that problem I just use some tea tree oil wash and the sensation is gone almost instantly. The bumps are gone within 2-3 hours which is awesome-Herbal Authority Tea Tree Oil Skin Wash + FREE 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil. It's been a pretty solid system overall and I know my girlfriend appreciates the upkeep as well. Oh another thing about the tea tree oil wash is that clears up acne really fast too. If I have anything popping up before a meeting at work I just use the wash and within 48 hours there's no signs anything was ever there. It's great.

It has a very constant noise (no recording/repeating sound) and they both work well to sleep or drown out the noise from outside. If you sleep in a small, decent size bathroom, 580a is loud enough for daily usage. I have the 580a and I have to cover all the holes to minimize the noise. It can be loud if I don't cover all the holes. Overall, $40 is good, I just hope it lasts a while, like a year or two."

245953,0,"My wife bugged me until I finally got her this product. She loved it! Said it was as good as what she used at Bally's. However, we did find that the suction cups wouldn't stick to our non-slip tub finish. Nothing I tried would make it stick. My wife gets in the tub on top of the mat and then turns on the blower. The hose did cause problems by coming out, but by putting a tye wrap arond the plastic socket for the hose, it stays in. Then the other end came out of the fitting going into the blower. Oh well, I fixed that too.Finally, it just quit working. I think there was water in the hose from being left in the tub after it came out of the mat once, and water drained back into the blower unit.The unit just won't turn on. I let it dry out one evening and it worked the next night for a little while, but finally quit completely.Next question if HoMedics looks at these reports. What kind of warrenty does it have. My wife got it for Christmas and we haven't had it a year yet.My wife does want another one, but I'll probably see what else is available , given the problems I've had to deal with on this one."

326083,0,"I just purchased my 3rd Remington MB-400 in just as many years. I love the product, its trimmer, the vacuum keeps my bathroom sink clean and its trimmings-catch is large enough for me to shave my head before emptying. But the battery is not user-replacable, and only lasts 1-year. I really wish this was a cordless/corded model (one which can run on battery or AC power if plugged in); unfortunately when the battery dies you just can't continue using it plugged in. Heavy *sigh*. So you'll be forced to buy a new one annually.... which really sucks since its Titanium (or ceramic) blades are strong enough to last a lifetime.I wish some Chinese knock-off would offer black market batteries... yeah they're not user-replacable, but it'd be worth removing a couple of screws!"
248151,0,"I bought this a couple years ago (April, 2008), and have been using it ever since, so I can tell you it's lasted pretty well. I think I've only ran out of charge with it in the shower once. Once you get the initial trimming done, maintenance doesn't take very long, and so I've never had problems with battery life. It automatically stops charging when the battery is full, which is nice, though I suppose if you don't use it for a while, the battery could drain even though it's in the charger, plugged in. The guards are nice, and I like that the head has a trimmer pointing both directions, and the guards fit facing either way.As I'm fairly hairy, I'm disappointed by how often I have to rinse it out while shaving. I generally have to take the guard off each time I rinse, and the guard goes on easily, but is kind of tough to get off, so it's a pain having to do that every minute or two. A lot of times, when I pull the guard off, I feel like it's going to break because it's so hard to pull off. I end up pulling the foil out, accidentally, too fairly often. It doesn't hurt anything, but it's a hassle. I don't expect not to have to rinse/clean it while using it, but having to take the guards off so frequently is really annoying. This being my first ""manscaping"" product, I can't say how it compares to other brands/models, but I'm a little disappointed. It's not bad for the price, though."

The author goes on in her article to state that only the Natren Brand follows the practice of keeping them separate. So I go to the Natren website to purchase *separate* strains and low and behold they sell the ""Holy Trinity"" which has the above 3 mentioned strains **TOGETHER**!!!

288753,0,"What can one say about a battery organizer other than how well it helps you organize your item? In this organizer's case, it does help me organize my batteries, but has a really big issue! The batteries don't properly fit into the organizer.I took a photo of this problem and placed it on my Flickr account. The photo is at: [...] You can click on the ""All Sizes"" link to look at larger and the original size. The original size shows the problem very well on my monitor, but your mileage may vary.I purchased two of these organizers because of how many batteries I own. Both units have the exact same issue with AA batteries. When you put a AA battery into a slot, it won't go all the way down the slot. The depth sometime is almost to the bottom and other times it is barely enough to hold the battery, when placed on a wall. The batteries aren't at fault. Why, do I say this as a fact? I can take the same battery and it will go down different lengths in each slot. I can take another battery and the same occurs, but also you'll notice the depths of these subsequent batteries are similar for each slot (even though you're using different batteries). In other words, the individual slots determine how far down a battery will go before you can't push it down any further.Finally, this problem causes issues when removing batteries from some of the slots and the unit is on the wall.In the photo, you'll notice the AAA batteries all fit perfectly in their slots. The manufacturer can get the slots the right size; they just didn't do it for the AA batteries.I'm giving the unit 3 stars, as it is good organizer and the tester is great to have. I must deduct the two stars (almost was three stars deducted), because the some of the slots won't let an appropriately size battery to slide all the way into it."

275142,0,"The Norelco 7140XL is an excellent electric razor. Compared to more expensive models, it seems to be a great way to go. Made almost entirely of virtually indestructible plastic, the 7140XL's light weight gives it a somewhat ""cheap"" feel. However, many months of everyday use have proved to be confidence inspiring. This shaver is easy to recharge with the included plug in cord and the charge lasts about 2 to 3 weeks which seems to be a long time considering how easy it is to recharge...simply plug it in overnight, and when it's done an LED in the front will blink to signal that it is recharged.The shave is close and fast and you'll be done in no time with no fuss or mess. Each of the three rotating heads flexes individually plus the entire head assembly flexes in the middle allowing it to follow the contours of your face. The only negative I have found is it doesn't shave hairs that lay flat against the skin like some of mine on the lower neck near the adam's apple. Maintenance is really easy, too...pop open the top, rinse under water, shake off excess water and let dry.The Norelco line has many models, and the heads are a significant part of the price of the shaver (like most parts that require periodic replacement). By the time the heads need to be replaced you will have had ample time to decide if this is the shaver for you. If shaving is a chore, you might as well decide based on quick, easy and convenient...on that basis Norelco is a reliable consideration.Best of life to you."

I'm also doing Terminal Extension exercies to help strenghten the muscles around my knees. To help them last longer, I keep them in my running sneakers and only where them to run.Also, my Reebok sneakers are a size 7 and I got the 6-6.5 size and they fit in my sneakers perfectly.

413078,0,"I was led astray by an earlier review.I wasted a lot of money finding plates that fit.The reviewer meant well but here is the deal.First the reviewer stated that 9 inch plates would not fit and that 9-1/4 inch wasthe perfect fit.This is ONLY true if you are talking about the very THIN plates that you would get at Staples, such as 100 for $8.00I made the mistake of buying Chinet Vista HEAVY duty plates which were 9-1/4 which DID NOT fit.Bottom Line:Thin plates requires 9-1/4 inchHeavier plates requires 9.0 inchesThe description states 9.0 OR 10-1/4 (do not mis-read as 9.0 to 10-1/4)The 10-1/4 size is meant to just lay on top and NOT to be tucked in under the tabs.Here is the link here at amazon to heavy plates, 9.0 inch that work perfectly.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JKRBAS/ref=ox_ya_oh_productStalkmarket 9-Inch Heavy Duty Plate, 25-Count Packages (Pack of 12)The price was not too bad ... They come 25 in a pack. There are 12 packs.Thiner plates would be cheaper, but I do not know where to get 9-1/4 inch thin plates.I do know that heavy Chinet Vista plates are 9-1/4 BUT THEY DO NOT FIT.The paper plate holder itself is NOT very heavy thus I believe using this plate holder with the heavy 9 inch paper plates are perfect.The plate holder is okay and will allow you to carry a drink and food with one hand.Without the heavy 9 inch paper plate that I found, this would get a one star.Now that you know of a heavy plate that does fits, then I would give it a four star.Since I wasted money and had a lot to go through, I am giving this a 3 star"

I used the Azulene oil before and after just like it says, but now I suffer from melasma, where the skin on my upper lip is darker than the rest of the skin on my face. My dermatologist said this is due to the wax strips taking off the top layer of my skin over and over, until there was damage and the skin is excessively sensitive to sun. I have to stay out of the sun and use SPF 5000, or else I look like I have a permanent chocolate milk mustache. He gave me some recommendations for GENTLER wax strips that aren't so harsh.

403776,1,"Having tried all the drugstore arch supports and other online varieties, the Powerstep and the Powerstep Pinnacle are excellent products and clearly the best I have encountered. Not only are they effective, but they are also comfortable.I have a high arch and was concerned at first that the arch in the Powerstep was not high enough to provide the benefits I needed, because some other medium-height supports did not help me. This turned out not to be a problem. After wearing the Powerstep for just a couple of days my heel problems were gone and my feet and knees felt well. Apparently the shape of the support is just right to provide the benefit.(Incidentally, my main problem has been heel spurs. An insightful doctor told me that they would stop hurting after using arch supports for a couple of months. He was right! Heel cushions are not the solution - arch supports are.)I have also used the Powerstep basic model, which is the same orthotic but without the additional padding. The Pinnacle is slightly more comfortable because of its softness. However, because of its additional thickness it fits in only one of my pairs of shoes, while the basic model fits in nearly all of them. If in doubt, buy the basic Powersteps, not the Powerstep Pinnacles.The orthics are made of high quality plastic, which have lasted me for several months so far. They are not as rigid and strong as the $300 variety, but I think that for the price they are reasonably sturdy.For several years I've looked for supportive and comfortable arch supports, and now that I've found the Powersteps I plan to stick with them. I recommend them highly."

258170,0,"EAS has apparently switched all it's protein to the Abbott. The Abbott brand requires two scoops to make one serving(26g), which is absurd! I miss the old EAS brand that just required one scoop to make a serving of 23 grams of protein. I think I'm gonna switch to another brand because two scoops each serving makes it run out faster; I think it's a way of making the buyer run out of protein faster and have to by more. The protein is okay, but two scoops to make a serving of the old EAS brand is what kills it."
287781,0,"Let me start by saying that I KNEW this soap had a very unique smell, described by other reviewers as being similar to a campfire. I thought that would be fine, since I love camping and campfires. Unfortunately, the soap I received smells nothing like a campfire; rather, it smells like a pile of burning tires. Or like burning garbage. (Having grown up in the country, I know what both of those things smell like.)Anyway, despite the awful smell, I tried using this soap several times. Contrary to what is written on the packaging, it did not lather white; the lather was more of a brownish-yellow. Fortunately it didn't seem to leave any discoloration on my skin. But the main reason that I won't be using this soap again is because the smell stayed on my skin for a very long time... 8+ hours. I could have lived with the brown lather and the nasty smell IF the smell had not stayed on my skin... but there is no way I'm going to go out in public smelling like a trash fire. Not gonna happen!I really, really wanted to like this soap. I've been searching for something that would help with acne and seb derm, and this soap seems to get a lot of good reviews from folks with those conditions. I'm wondering if the manufacturer changed the formula or something, because the soap I received is just nasty and is not like the soap described in the other reviews.Anyway, give it a try, but be prepared to smell like ashes and cinders."

98109,0,"At first I was disgusted with this product. I used it everyday faithfully for two weeks and my legs still felt shaggy. Finally I had to shave with a razor. The next day and everyday since then I have used this shaver and it has been doing a pretty good job. The trick seems to be to start with your legs already free of any noticeable hair growth then use this product everyday to keep hair from becoming visible; your legs actually will feel smooth. I think Conair should say that in the instuctions and save people a lot of aggravation.The advantages of this shaver are:1. I can sit comfortably in a chair to shave instead of lying on my back in the tub with my leg in the air.2. It's convenient. I don't have to get undressed and get wet. I can shave while the bath water is running so it saves time.3. It's easy on my skin (though razor burn hasn't been a problem for me since I started making my own soap).The disadvantages are:1. Your have to keep it charged. I'm not sure I would bother to take it if I was traveling.2. It does actually take longer than shaving with a razor, but I find it more pleasant to use so maybe I just do it longer.3. It is useless against visible hair."
420084,0,"Gilette's Lemon-Lime shaving cream is a little better than your standard or average shaving cream. Infused with moisturizers that give you a pretty fair shave, and loaded with lots of foaming agents (yeeesh), it's worth the $2.00 I pay at Wallymart or Shoppers Drug Mart.I gotta say that this can is loaded with a refeshing scent of lemon lime that smells more like dessert than a shaving cream. And that's a good thing, and a bad thing if you haven't had dessert yet. Now it isn't a platinum or premium cream, and there are no major skin benefits to this one, as it's hardly anywhere near a natural product other than the minute amounts of aloe in it. Still, my face feels alright afterwards, and it surprisingly doesn't irritate my skin. Okay!The can is rust resistant, but I still leave the can out of the shower, and keep it in the cabinet above my sink. And how ironic that the can is coloured after....a lime. You get quite a lot from the can, and it lasts for a long time.So, recommended? Yeah, why not! Just be careful not to eat this stuff guys...it really smells that good!"

74089,0,Compared to my older trimmers the Wahl is built much better. It is easy to use and has many attachments to choose from. The only problem I encountered while doing my sons hair was that it can actually draw blood. I took off the attachments and was trying to clean up around the front of the ear when I nicked him. Then doing the other ear I got him again. The old trimmers just didn't have the power to do something like that so I was caught off guard. All in all I think they are good trimmers but just require a little more care then other trimmers.

266087,2,"(solid pink handle)I purchased the wondfo pregnancy test strips in April of this year. I used them April and May did not get an evap or any indication of 2 lines. I used them this month at what was possibly 8 days after ovulation (could tell by pain in side) and had an ever so light shadow. At 9 days after ovulation it was still a shadow but darker. At 10 days after ovulation I took it with first morning pee and it was darker so I took a First response and a very very light line came up. I took another a few hrs later and it was more noticable as a line on the wondfo and first response. The lines were still not getting very much darker though. So the next day I went and had a beta blood test and it came back at 7.28!!!! But right after I got home not knowing what the beta was yet I took another wondfo and answer and they both had lines!!!!! Sadly it is a chemical, but I will definatly use the test again the only reason I would say not to use them would be if you did not want to find out too early. But for the price there really is no reason. And I got them from about 5 days from when I ordered them.(UPDATE) July ordered more received in same amount of time as last. I was sent the ones that have hcg all over them. I took one (to have a negative to comapre the others to) that day. I was only at most 5 days after ovulation. I got a line!!!!! It looked very evapish. I waited till 7 days after and took another nothing really. Took one at 8 days after and got very faint lines all day bairly there. Started out looking like a shadow with first morning pee Then got a hair darker about 12 pm. Then by 10 pm back to nothing. However I took a solid handle (I had a few left) with the 12 pm that I had gotten a line with the pink hcg one and got nothing on the solid pink one!!!!!. I would love for them to go back to the solid pink again they were very reliable. If not I doubt I will buy any more from them and try to find the others somewhere else."

287100,0,"...with a pharmaceutical-grade or USP glucosamine or chondroitin supplement, along with Sea Cucumber which provide tremendous and fast relief (within 24 hours) from a painful arthritic condition I have in my hips. Hyaluronic acid by itself did nothing for me, but it appears only to work as a partner with other joint relief ingredients. I've tried a lot of joint-relief formulas in the last 12 months, and this product did nothing on it's own. Coupled with the Sea Cucumber (NOW Foods), it's ruthless in it's attack against my arthritis, but alone, it's a lonely soldier with no ammunition. This product, along with a pharmaceutical-grade or USP Glucosamine and Chondroitin make a formidable and effective anti-inflammatory, but without the Sea Cucumber to back them up they are only minimally effective.I've tried this product, as well as other store brands of similar composition that contain glucosamine and chondroitin. I've also taken Shark Cartilage, MSM, Celedrin, Tart Cherry Concentrate, cod liver oil, Reservatrol, Black Cohosh, White Willow Bark, Passionflower, Burdock root, Dandelion root, ibuprofin, aspirin, acetaminophen, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and Celbrex.

42673,0,"First, as was pointed out in the comments in response to Chris Sebastian's review below, these are simply re-branded Sanyo Eneloop batteries. As someone who once loved Sony and then realized that they are far more interested in your money (or in installing DRM on your computer without your knowledge) than in selling you a quality product, I now ""vote"" with my wallet and avoid Sony at all costs - and so would recommend you get the original Eneloop batteries instead (hence my giving 3 stars).Second, the ""best"" battery depends on what it's used for and how soon it is used after being given a full charge (days vs. weeks vs. months). For a better explanation of this, see this article [ http://www.gaiageek.com/tech/gadgets/the-best-aa-rechargeable-batteries ] which includes info on the Sanyo Eneloops and other low self discharge batteries as well as the best ""standard"" NiMH rechargeables.

I think we average 3 days for a single charge on one appliance and we do not share our appliances, so that's one chage lasting 3 days with the appliance being used once a day for about 2 to 2.5 minutes each time (we were advised to use itonly once a day to preserve tooth enamel).

66766,0,I had a Wahl beard trimmer for 12 years till I dropped it. I purchased this to replace the one I broke. The unit itself seems to work fine. The attachment for the beard is very flimsy and I can see how it would be easy to break. It goes on hard and you have to twist it to get it off. Not sure how long it will last. Fortunately I kept the beard attachment from the one I broke and it's very well made. It also works great on this unit. Easy on easy off. Not sure what they were thinking but then again it's very inexpensive and it's 12 years later. New and improved???

It is easier to manage and you won't clip off pieces of their fingers, as I have done with the infant nail clipper (and many other mothers have done the same I have since learned). Nail files are not effective, nor is biting their fingernails! I have tried everything. I love the storage aspect of the 30-piece kit as it zips up neatly and allows enough room to consolidate other relevant things such as teethers. If you were to buy various kits separately for the items you will use, it would add up to the same cost without the benefit of one nice bit storage bag. One of the reviewers was kind enough to list all the items in the 30-piece kit, which I found extremely helpful when I initially registered for the kit.

96273,0,"I was excited to try the Rit Stain Remover because several of the reviews were very positive. It sounded as if the pricy product would be well worth it. I eagerly pulled all of my very lightly stained cotton blouses (very tiny grease spots)from my closet. Following the directions on the Rit Stain Remover bottle I poured, rubbed and let sit for 10 minutes. Anticipating spot free shirts I was greatly disappointed. Yes, several spots were gone but many still remained. I had to re-apply the Rit, let stand longer and soak in the washer for over a half hour. By this time I have used more than half the bottle of Rit... I would'nt waste my money on this product. Spray and Wash works much much better and far less expensive. I wish I could get my money back but by the time I send the product back and paid postage I can buy an alternative product that is easier to use and much cheaper. The only reason I rated this a 3 star is because the Rit was sent in a semi-timely manner."
14589,1,Shake tasted good. The strawberry banana tastes more like regular strawberry than the strawberry flavored one. The strawberry banana is a little thicker than regular strawberry.
403183,0,A high price for the item. but they work as you would expect. nothing special about them. Wouldn't buy them again. Just like the ones that come in the box.

309326,0,It's overly flexible and frankly isn't that great of a product for isolating massage areas. I probably should have investigated a little more into the other reviews before buying but it was cheap enough I thought it might be a good call - this one didn't pay off though. Avoid.
393909,1,This product has reduced the redness of acne and other marks on my face. It has given my face a healthy glow and i no longer have dryness like i did before using this product. Great product and it works
12310,0,"This one was a bit too sweet for me. While overall it has a good texture and flavor, that extra kick of sweetness was a bit much. Some folks might prefer this bar, though, to its less sweet counterpart, the chocolate peanut butter bar. (The PB bar is my favorite)Suggestion: buy one of each flavor and do a taste test. Come back to your favorite for the 25-bar box discount."
171483,0,"Not a kid, just anonymous:Two years ago I moved from an apartment with significant light exposure from the south, to a narrow northern exposure. In the old apartment, I got hyper in summer; in this apartment, I'm never hyper, and am very sluggish of a winter morning.The box arrived on time and was very lightweight. More than half of it was empty, with a cardboard divider to fill up room. More than half of the remainder was a black cloth bag (the ""travel case"") and the rest was the device, sized like a portable CD player but lighter. The manual mostly said to go to the manufacturer's website, where you can use the device's serial number to log in and fill out a personalized questionnaire that calculates your current circadian rhythm, your desired rhythm, and a recommended usage schedule to shift the former to the latter.It did help me shift my schedule almost two hours earlier, but I don't have any more energy than I used to, and certainly no feelings of euphoria or improved mood, at the schedule that was recommended for me (30-45 minutes at 90% intensity). If anything, it's just two more hours in the morning for me to feel really tired during. It's a LOT easier for me to fall asleep now, but I find myself having a lot more dreams than I did before, and most of them are nightmares. Also, the glare of the lights gives me a headache, so it's hard to use a computer during the treatment (instead, I write in a notebook).I like it, and will continue to use it or lend it to slug-a-bed friends.A side note: as an engineer I don't understand how an array of blue LEDs can retail for more than $50. The profit margins on this thing must be incredible."

162775,1,I was feeling so lithargic & run down I didn't think anything would pic me up. But I'll try anything once. Not much difference the first 2 weeks but as I continued to take the procuct I started noticing my staminia was regained. After a month now I am optimistic this is the answer to continued better health. I also found a suppliment called CHIA [salvia hispanica L] that energizes your body too. My left knee was out of wack from a fall on it & now I am able to walk on it with far less stree & pain. Not sure if its the cell food or the DMSO compound I rub on it. These are now my maintenence meds. [I'll be checking my BP & Chorlesterol soon to see how they were affected.]

310661,0,"I love the machine although I buy my on oils. I use Orleans home fragrance oils usually the Lemon Verbena it smells great and clean!! The reason I gave only 3 stars is because I've constantly have had problems with the tank/the bottom where the water and fragrance goes!! It cracks all over it starts out small then continues to crack in other places I used super glue to repair for a short period until it wouldn't work it was leaking constantly!! I called customer service and they sent out another one and it worked great for a while then happened again!! I called customer service and had another one sent to me and the samething happened!! I also have a friend that had to do the samething, it's a shame after all those problems with the defect n the bottom, it seems like they would have changed the bottom to a more durable plastic by now!! I'm sure we are not the only people that have had this problem!! I ended up getting a Rainbow rain mate and the bottom isn't hard plastic and I haven't had any problems with it Thank God!!! So I prefer the rain mate over the Homeics machine, but if they change the plastic I'd love to buy another one!!"

79046,0,"There are many features of this monitor that I love. It keeps track of 30 blood pressure readings for two users which can be loaded into a PC for analysis (software included). It can also be set to take your blood pressure once or automatically take three consecutive measurements and provide an average which should be more accurate. However, after comparing the readings to my standard arm cuff machine and with the one at my doctors office I found the Systolic measurement to be about 17% higher."

400152,0,"I bought this since it could be battery operated for traveling in Europe. It had a tendency to turn itself off, and I had the auto timer turned off. I took an entire package of 8 batteries for the week since I had read that it would burn through them. I replaced the first four batteries after five nights and the machine worked find the next three nights. However, it accomplished what I needed it to do except when it turned itself off."
215823,0,"The way these may be shipped to you may mean they leak slightly. When I received this 12 pack, all of them had oil in the cap, which would then spill out onto the counter, your fingers, your clothing - when opened. Attempts to pour the oil back into the container were for naught. Though I don't think it will detriment the life cycle too much, its annoying and messy to have to deal with. Be careful when opening these, they might have had a rough trip to your door.Otherwise, no issues."
150242,0,I got the chocolate. It takes like crap. Good thing it's cheap. Maybe I put too much water or something but it was not good. I have tasted the Monster Mass and Monster Milk stuff. That tastes really good. I was hoping this would be the same but it isn't.

412357,2,"Nair Lasting Effects Hair Remover, Ready to Use Wax Strips, Legs/Body/Biniki Area 1 kitI am very dissapointed with this purchase because the seller sent an expired product. It does not show the expiration date but it must be expired since the wax strips are really dry and even after following the instructions and trying to separate the strips, still they are hard and dry. I had used this product in the past when it was sold at stores,(now is not sold anymore at stores here in MN) and it worked just fine but this time I believe that I lost my money."

135244,0,"This product served its purpose and served me well with daily use for two and a half years. But now it's developed a crack in the hose near the hand piece. Water squirts out of the crack, rendering the product useless now. I'd expect to get well more than just two or three years of daily use out of a product like this, so I'm dissatisfied. Hence the three out five stars rating, due to mediocre product longevity,"
363926,0,"very well made, great for role playing but awkward in actual use.

212578,0,I purchased this rechargeable shaver because I couldn't find much else available anywhere. My dad likes the Wahl brand and has owned several models over time. But then this brand disappeared from all the places he usually buy it from and I had to search for one. I found this one for him and bought it. It is not a very fancy one and is a lower grade model than he has ever purchased in this brand. The casing is just plastic and it feels cheap. But it is dong the job and doing it well. It is the best I was able to find and I hope it lasts.
193146,0,"Littmann stethoscopes are known for their quality, durability...and price. I received a Cardiology II as a gift upon entering Medical school and absolutely loved it. Well, it finally broke and I decided to purchase the Cardiology III as a replacement. While the sound quality was not awful (though not as good as my Cardiology II), the tunable feature was annoying as I was used to my traditional bell. Tunable stethoscopes feature the diaphragm and bell on one chestpiece instead of two, and the pressure applied must be adjusted for high and low frequency sounds. Yet, this design does not work well on curved surfaces.I do not know why Littmann is moving away from traditional stethoscopes, but I wish they had not discontinued some of their older models. Instead, I have been using a GRx CD-27 for the past few months and could not be happier with it. It offers superior ausculatation, durability and at about one-fourth the price. I have recommended it to all my colleagues and especially my students. It offers better performance to the Cardiology III without the guesswork that comes with tunable stethoscopes."

208617,0,"I bought these for my husband, hoping he would take them every day. Nothing happened for him, but this was mainly because he didn't take them everyday. As with all herbal supplements, you have to take them everyday as directed for some time to see any results. It took my husband three months to finish a 30 day supply. I am sure that if he had taken them every day like he was supposed to he would have seen some results."
388141,0,"I was disgusted at how cheaply made this unit is. The stethoscope parts are made of easily bendable psuedo-metal, the cuff is plastic and very lightweight. I was also surprised that ""some assembly is required"", which I did not anticipate.That said, I was also surprised at how well I could hear the pulse beat through the Mickey Mouse stethoscope and the reading was very accurate. It is also much easier to put on your own arm because of the metal D ring attached. It also comes with a decent carrying case.I don't know why anyone wouldn't go with a digital automatic monitor these days, other than maybe cost. I'm a nursing student and wanted to see the difference in ease and sound quality between using the standard 2 equipment protocol (stethoscope and bp cuff) and this with the built in stethoscope. I was pleasantly surprised and will keep this cheap little unit in my car first aid kit. Not sure how long it will last, but it is low priced and easy to use."

167066,0,I bought this as a pre-workout supplement trying to get a better pump and more out of my workouts. In terms of pump this is a good supplement and it tastes pretty good too (I got blue raz).. the only negative i have for this is that it has a bunch of caffeine and sometimes gives me the jitters.

The rolls are thread bare and fell apart as I tried to wrap the gauze around his leg it folded up onto itself to make a thin rope or fell apart. The only good thing was that my husband and I got a good laugh at what a horribly made product this is. If you are thinking of purchasing this go to the clearance bin at Walmart and find some old, weak, cheap thread and wrap it around your injury, you'll get the same result."

404338,0,"The batteries I ordered shipped and arrived in a timely fashion, and no complaints about the (new) condition of the batteries.However, these batteries were available at quite a low price ($2.48 per set of four, I should perhaps have been suspicious, but via Amazon.com I guess my guard was down ...). The total charge for 5 sets of 4-count batteries was $12.40. What I didn't notice when I clicked the button to complete the transaction (I was buying multiple things at the time) was that shipping and handling came to $24.95. That seems like a lot of money to mail out 20 lithium AA batteries to a domestic address.I initially sent an email (via Amazon.com) to the seller but didn't hear anything for a couple of days. But then shortly after I gave some less-than-stellar feedback about this, I got a terse email saying that I would get a $10 credit, ""and please remove your feedback"".I appreciate the refund, but I'm disinclined to remove the feedback. I've upgraded from 2 to 3 stars based on the refund, but I think that folks should be leery of low priced items for which the seller is charging a high S&H; price."

89201,1,"Despite the reviews on this list, I bought the Taylor Body Fat analyzer (actually, it may be a slightly newer model, #5561), and went home and followed the directions exactly (I even read the disclaimers about hydration levels affecting accuracy). The weight was very close (if not exact) to the measurements I got at a weight watchers establishment.As for the body fat, I measured it 4 times within 10 minutes, and 3 out of 4 measurements were exactly the same, and the fourth measurement was only one tenth of a percent different. I can't speak for the absolute accuracy of the insturment, but it was also a very believable number. I don't know how it will last after time, but this seems like a decent buy to me."
416591,0,This is product should come in a spray applacation so it can be applyed on the face easier. When put on hands it runs down my arms and when applyed on face your pushing the hair down with your hands so that is defeating the purpose of the product intentions. It would be less messy as well.
53562,0,"it appears the brush heads have become smaller. Is it any wonder? Almost every other manufacturer is giving you less these days. Just look at the cans of tuna fish, boxes of cereal, cans of coffee, etc. They raise the prices and reduce the quantity of what they are selling.

193897,0,"This product is not exactly the greatest. It does sort of put my shoulders in the correct position, but it doesn't adjust in the center like the advertized picture shows, which is where I need the adjustment due to my small build. I put a hand towel under each strap on my chest and that seemed to help. Also it hurts your underarms (which the hand towels also helped with). It's okay though, not worth the price by any means (I could have made this myself with felt fabric), but does help a little."
297672,0,Does not cut nearly as good as the original blades did. I should have bought a new razor instead of replacement blades.
320137,0,"I purchased this product because I was in need of a teeth whitening kit to use over the summer. I read over the previous reviews, and decided to purchase it.I was unaware of what was inside this box, so I'll just explain it for those who are in doubt.It comes with two wax like teeth trays, that you place in boiling or hot water for 20 seconds, and place them in your teeth to mold. If you aren't satisfied with the fit, just dip it in hot water again, and it will re-mold. I loved that. Also came with whitening gel and a final mouthwash.Tried the kit out, kept it in my mouth for 20 minutes (which was the suggested time) and didn't really see a difference. Only saw white spots in my teeth, and it's a tad too complicated for me, even though it's summer, still a bit busy, and I'd rather use whitening strips or something, but I bet the results are satisfying. I just have a short intention span."
167779,0,"I had this shaver for about 2 1/2 years, only because it fell and broke. But I will say that this works descent enough on your legs, yes you do have to go over the same area about 2 or 3 times, which can be consuming, so by the time you get to your other leg, you better be quick because the battery will run out or start slowing down. This is not good to shave over sensitive skin or creases of any kind, it will turn red, and get those dreadful razor bumps, just stick to legs. Very easy to clean, and it works in the shower. If you are looking for something affordable, I recommend you buy it. Personally, it was a gift and I never minded having to shave over the same area, but I did mind that annoying battery if I was in a rush."
71574,1,I have been using this oil for a while now as it is the only thing I have found that works for me. I have sensitive skin and normally get irritation from shaving but this oil prevents that and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.

BUT WHEN I OPENED THE BOX, YOU COULD ALREADY TELL THAT SOMEONE HAD OPENED IT, USED IT ONCE OR TWICE THEN DECIDED TO TRY AND RESELL IT.

155385,0,"I bought this kit out of desperation (for all day ""morning sickness""). I've now had this kit for 2 days and have tried everything in it so far. The candys are all pretty tasty, and the spicy ginger candies surprisingly do not cause that (new) feeling of heartburn I am now getting from other spicy things. The tea smells wonderful in the jar. As for whether they work, well all the candies seem to dampen my nausea, but it comes right back after the candy is done. This morning I drank some of the tea with breakfast, and then about an hour or so later WHILE having a BNatal drop I had to take it out of my mouth and run to the bathroom.I plan to keep using the candies (but not the BNatal's), smell the dry tea... and try acupressure wrist bands next."

It still has the same basic terrible design, made of white metal with a thin part right where the most strength is needed, so it breaks if you tap it too hard when you clean it. But it will last a few years, I suppose."

302627,1,"I actually look forward to using this toothbrush each time. It leaves your gums and mouth feeling stimulated and fresh. My dentist says my teeth have never been cleaner -- better placque removal than during all the years I used successive Sonicares. The Flexisoft Oral-B brushhead (included in the package) fits well into all crevices and corners, and seems to cup each tooth for a very thorough cleaning. The Polishing brushhead, also included, whitens my teeth as well as any bleaching product I ever tried. I'm happy not to use those bleaching chemicals anymore, and it's great to now be free of the painful sensitivity they caused. Thank you Oral-B for such a superior and well-made product."
259798,0,"Instead of there being a little door on each compartment, there is a lifting action that is needed to open each bin. I like that it is very durable, but it is very unhandy for my Son, who is a stroke survivor, to access. He is unable to use his right hand, so to take his meds, after lifting the lid on the day and time he wants, he has to lift the whole pill box to his mouth. . A better design would be ; each day would lift out of the main box for easier access."
114637,1,"I recently purchased this product after being skeptical as I have terrible luck with electric shavers. All tend to leave me irritated and not satisfied. But after seeing it on a lighting deal for around 39 I had to give it a shot, So far it has worked beyond expectations it cuts close to the skin and little irritation for a person who has to shave twice a day to keep clean that's a plus. Highly recommend it."
145037,0,"I've had my deodorant stone for more than half a year now and I've still got quite a bit left (a little less than half). Granted, I don't use it every day, but only on occasions when I think I'm going to need it. I don't have terrible body odor so I can't say how effective it is for those who do, but I tend to sweat a lot during the hot summer months, or in the winter time when I'm wearing stuffy sweaters and going back forth between the cold outdoors and the warm indoors.To use, simply wet the stone and apply generously to your DRY underarms! It's important that your armpits are dry because it won't be very effective otherwise. This is why many people prefer to apply it after they shower. But I apply it both after I shower and once again in the morning before I go out. If you touch the skin (once it's dried) where you've applied the stone to, you'll notice a velvety feel to it. This means that the stone is working because it is drying up the area and killing the bacteria that causes your armpits to stink.Notice that this product is only a deodorant, so it will not stop you from regularly sweating. If you're like me and don't sweat a lot, it might be worth investing in. If you want to cease/ slow the sweating or if you're going on a date, you might want to keep a tube of anti-perspirant deodorant handy. For me, this product has not been fool-proof. It doesn't always work as well as I'd like it to, but I use it because it's made of natural ingredients and won't clog up your pores. I also heard that it can be used on other parts of the body, but I have not tried. But since it's just salt, it probably won't hurt to try :)"

Yes this will help increase blood flow which is awesome for working out, and if you have constricted blood vessels your flaccid penis may hang a little lower.

6328,0,"The product itself is good and contains everything you'd expect from a cheap eyeglass repair kit; however, it's just too expensive when shippping and handling is added. You're better off getting the same thing at a local drug or convenience store for a much lower price, no more than 3 dollars. I happen to be on a military base overseas that didn't have these in stock for a while."

Natural is always better, right? In this case, not so.This mix does not have as good of a flavor as the regular gold standard vanilla. More importantly, the product does not mix as well as the original Gold Standard whey. I like the idea of a natural product, but I will be switching back to the original Gold Standard Whey next time around."

61956,0,I have had this tub for 5 months now and it's getting better as my son gets older. He enjoys his bath-but when he was a newborn the netting barely touched the water which kept him cold. Now that he's 5 months old he can sit in it a little better but it's still doesn't seem the most comfortable. He like's to kick in the tub which makes him arch his body and get hit by the hump. And the head support should be a little taller for those kids who are longer. This tub is probably better for a baby that can sit without support.

107772,0,"I just ordered some of these Thursday Plantation toothpicks from Amazon. Several reviews state they are strong. Perhaps there is some variation in the manufacturing but I consider them to be quite mild. My perference is the toothpicks from Tea Tree Thereapy Inc. that are labeled: ""Tea Tree Thereapy - Tea Tree Toothpicks"". Those have quite a bit more punch than the Thursday Plantation offering. One item to note is that these toothpicks seem to be a bit more durable tan the Tea Tree Therapy ones so that is a plus for this brand. Again this is likely due to variation in the natural materials used. Happy toothpicking!"

However, am frustrated that I immediately had what appeared to be battery acid breakdown, or at least that is what the gunk appeared to be as have not disassembled it to find out. There is also weird gunk that builds up on the recharger base. I clean and dry the item after every single use, but am still getting this crud. I read the basics of the guide, but shouldn't have to compeltely digest an instruction manual for a toothbrush; which is getting readily apparent to be something I need to do before I destroy the brush completely with whatever neglect is causing this crap. Regardless; even the crappiest user in the world shouldn't have these problems from the get go.

147117,0,"Its really good value for the price but they need to work on the organization of the pockets. Everything seems to be crammed in the pockets. When an emergency occurs you don't have time to go through each and everything to see where is what. It should be, you see, you grab and you take. With this one, you see, you see again, you finally grab and take. But yeah lots of bandages and what not. I do like the soft cover though. Its florescent orange so its easy to spot.

They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars.

The suggested serving of two capsules only gives you 260mg of EPA,220mg of DHA , 250mgs of CLA and 80mg of GLA. I bought this so I wouldn't have to keep track of buying various pills but due to it having such low values I'd have to take several of these pills for it to be potent.

103709,1,"They smell like Baby Wipes, they look like Baby Wipes, you use them like Baby Wipes; just call them what they are, Baby Wipes for adults or call them Adult Wipes.Well, I discovered something amazing, which anyone can try. After wiping yourself with dry toilet paper, wipe yourself with a wet nap or these. No matter how much I wiped my keister with dry TP I still got stains when wiping with these afterwards..... which means that dry TP can never get your keister completely clean. I can't imagine how many years I've been walking around with a dirty keister when I thought I was clean. Which means that TP isn't really the most important invention known to mankind that I thought it was. So I guess, if you really want a clean keister, you need to wet wipe it afterwards.But here's the rub (no pun intended), these wipes are too small. They're only 6 inches X 6 inches, and you have to fold them over at least twice to prevent any fecal matter from soaking through. And my keister is only average sized. I think they need to be 8 inches X 8 inches minimum. Still at least, I think it's better than just using dry TP. The best of course is to use a bidet. If the above was TMI (Too Much Information), remember, you clicked on a review for something you wipe your keister with."
410861,0,"Others complain of clumpiness, my can of this was a fine powder throughout, no issues with clumps. I was able to dump this straight into the toilet. Now here's the issue. I have an old house with an old toilet. The water level is high, and it flushes slowly. This stuff expands far faster than the toilet flushed and ended up all over my floor, nothing I could do until finally the water level dropped and took this stuff with it. So I had a giant mess to deal with. If I had it to do over, I'd have lowered the water level in the bowl a lot and maybe tried to pour this while the water was already swirling to try to keep the foam at bay.In our case, a plumber told us to dump in a root killer every six months as a preventive measure so I can't gauge how well it works at sorting that out.I follow a basic system that says five star items are rare, they're the best I've ever seen. Fours stars means it's good, does as advertised, either better than similar competitors or it's a better value. Three means it's what I'd expect, no significant complaints but wouldn't go out of my way to use it again. I'm giving it three stars because it does indeed foam and expand as advertised and my particular can was clump free, all good things. But a warning that you basically have no time to flush would have been useful and without it a significant portion of the product ended up on my floor, useless. If you're more careful than I was, your mileage may vary."
233376,0,"Since there are so many other long reviews, I will keep this short and note one significant shortcoming.First, all functions seems to work as expected with AA's (double A).But this exotic ""smart"" charger is not smart enough to know when AAA (triple A) cells are being used. As a result it rejects many good AAA's as bad and refuses to charge them.So rather than prolonging the life of AAA's, it deems them un-chargeable (hence unusable) long before they have died a natural death.Even a cheap AAA charger may be better for getting full life cycle from AAA's."

It just feels warm and you could hear your ear wax sizzle.The hilarious part was my mom was so busy laughing at me do mine when she went to cut the fire out a part flew and caught her hair on fire. It was an overall hilarious experience. I dont know if it worked or not, but a bit of wax sure did come out of each ear. My hearing seems the same. What i would highly recommend this for is for people with ear infections, i think it would help it feel a lot better and also people who have hurt ears from long flights and stuff. Either way hilarious experience at a good price =) ~ Thanks guys!"

Effective at stabilizing weak or recovering ankle. Support for walking and most light activities. The side stabilizers have minimal padding. They can bruise bony knobs and any hard surface of your foot. Recommend you always wear socks and add some kind of padding. Use one that is pliable and distributes pressure such as gel pads and foam inner sole material.

71417,0,I am a full time working mom and I pump every day. The storage system functions well but takes up too much space in the freezer. I have a chest freezer that is currently half full of nothing but stored breastmilk in the Lansinoh storage bags because they store flat. I wouldn't have nearly enough room for the playtex ones and for the cost I wouldn't be able to afford that many lids.It is a great idea though. I am hoping I will use the supplies more when I stay at home with baby #2 and I am not pumping every day.
357687,2,"Other reviewers rated this highly, but that was not my experience. This was purchased for my 85 yr old mother, who is pretty sharp and has good eyesight. The display was way too complicated and busy for her. In the Tru-read mode where it is supposed to take 3 measurements sequentially at 1 minute intervals (the user chooses the interval), it appeared to take 3 measurements, but only displayed 2 of them on one occasion, and only 1 the last time we tried it. The averaging function seemed incorrect for the 2 measurements, and it was confusing whether it was displaying the average, or the individual measurements since the icons were small. The user manual is inadequate and poorly explains how to use it. When I tried it on myself (I have low BP), I had difficulty finding the correct positioning on my chest at heart level. My mother decided she preferred her old traditional cuff unit."

227910,2,"I don't know whose neck this is supposed to fit, but it's way too short and a bit too wide for most necks. The Velcro closure is barely long enough to fit a small neck so will never be suitable for most necks.The instructions are printed with errors and grammatically incorrect making them very tricky to understand, if at all.The controls are difficult to adjust having to press and/or hold this button and that for the proper ""mode"" and adjustment. Call me crazy but I just want a heating pad I can easily flip on and use. In addition, the lightweight control is placed upside-down in the very heavy cord making adjusting it a bit of a challenge; however, the cord is long enough to accommodate this ridiculous blunder should the outlet be near.I give it one star for the fact that it is versatile and one for the soft cover. You can use it for elbows, knees, etc., which I suspect, is really what it is for and not the neck."

395634,1,I use this for my bird because it will build up the immune system. He's an African grey parrot and does well on flower remedies. I like this one because it is non-alcholic. He gets 5 drops a day. I can tell he feels better right away when he takes it.
340282,0,"Purchased these after many months of leg pain at work. My chair was resulting in awful, long-lasting pain in my thighs. Tried these out of desperation and they were a good choice for pain relief. The first time wearing them the pain was gone. Really enjoy that the toes are opened-- helps with airflow, feels less constricted, and you can still wear open-toed shoes without anyone noticing the stockings. The only cons are that wearing them more than once can result in smelly feet, and they don't hold-up very well in the washer (even on a hand-wash cycle). I would recommend actually hand washing these or expect to reorder every month. They are available through subscribe & save with Amazon, which takes 15% off each order, so if you go through these quickly, at least Amazon offers a little savings."
227424,2,"I purchased this to help my foot after surgery. The 'smart heat' did not keep the water warm at all, even though I made sure the water was very warm when I filled the spa. With or without the bubble action, the water cooled immediately. The 3 stationary massage attachments are in a very uncomfortable place for me, and cannot be re-positioned. This spa was a terrible disappointment, definitely not worth the trouble of setting it up and putting it away afterward."

230073,1,"How convenient by mail, and even cheaper than purchasing in a store, but first you have to find the product in a store! I had forgotten how great my shaver was, the replacement was long over due."
402475,2,"Might be good for travel, where there isn't access to a tub or used as a small pool, but isn't practical for nightly use, especially if others use the tub. My daughter is almost 5 months, no way would I use this on the counter. The age says 6-24 months. I don't see 12-24 month using this tub. I wish I would have used it sooner to get more use out of it.Also, the duck say HOT when the water is barely warm. Only when the water was cold was the sensor blue. My daughter did laugh at the quacking, so that was worth the $15. I'll likely put a blanket under it on the porch and use it as a little pool this summer."
50669,1,"I tried Estroven and it worked fine, but just this EP oil works just as well and has a great value for the price and amount. I have been using this for over a year now and highly recommend it because in my case it has eliminated evening sweats, can sleep through the night and I've never had a problem with hot flashes start either. 2 years ago I was wondering why i wasn't feeling as energetic and normal as usual, but EP oil has been part of helping me feel great during a mature woman's changes of life."
383357,0,It's like 300 grit sand paper. I need to rip dead skin away faster. Good for women. Can't beat the price!
52585,2,"I was so excited to find this product due to much pressure and discomfort in my third pregnancy. However, I ended up needing to return it. It fit everywhere quite well and had many adjustable straps, except the one strap that goes under your belly. This felt too tight to me and was uncomfortable. I definitely couldn't sit down with it on and even when standing it left a visible impression under my baby belly.This may be because I carry very low and have a little extra belly fat, but still if they had only made it adjustable I would have loved to keep this product. Unfortunately now I am still unable to find something that works. My only suggestion would be, if you are a slightly bigger girl, try ordering one size larger than you think. I purposely did not because other reviews suggested to order your exact size. Anyhow, it was worth a try. Now if I can just find something else. This product would likely still work for your average or small sized woman."
153673,0,"I bought these stricktly based on the low cost. They work well, fit well, but they are more feminine design (obviously I'm a male then!). I use them but I left the rose colored ones at home so I don't have to be embarrased by them in public. It would have been nice to have color choices as the dark colored versions look much better on a male."
197880,0,"I have used this a couple times with my anxious 6 year old. I don't notice a difference. That's not to say it doesn't work at all, but I don't notice. Maybe I need to use more than the package recommends. I didn't think he would like the taste, but he was ok with it in a cup of water. But he didn't even notice it in a cup of juice. I don't think I would recommend it, but it's so cheap, its worth a shot."
88819,0,"This was one of those &quot;I've got to have it&quot; items that was on my registry. I used it a few times and then that was it. It does work well at cushioning, but I found that my son wasn't immersed enough in the water and would start to get cold as did the water that collected on top of the cushion.I also got the Evenflo Infant to Toddler bath that has the built in (removable) inclined, cushioned insert that worked quite well instead. With the insert removed, the cushion made a perfect fit, I just found that I preferred the bathtub insert more."

415493,2,"I read the reviews and decided to test this out. When I use it first thing in the morning it shows no ferning (even after a half hour or more), but at night when I come home from work and check it again, there is ferning. Seems like there is some kind of ferning every day. It may just be me, but I don't think that this is a reliable product."

53267,0,I bought 2 Sonicare brushes approximately 2 1/2 years ago. They worked great but one of them decided to not hold a charge. I am quite disappointed as I thought I could just replace the battery. I paid almost $90.00 and did not get the life expectancy I thought I would.
201418,0,"I like the style of dust pan that comes with this broom, but I feel the broom itself is a little too small."
247573,0,"This trimmer is great if you want to shave down to smooth skin, but the trimmer attachments are quite ineffective. (For example, trimming hair down to a uniform quarter or half inch.) The attachments don't do a good job of guiding hair into the actual cutters so you have to make many passes to get all the hair. Even then, the remaining hair isn't an even length. If you want uniformly trimmed hair, you're better off with traditional clippers like the Wahl 9627 (just one example). And watch out -- without the attachments, the Bodygroom has been known to bite in tight areas! But if you want smooth skin without using a razor, this is the device for you."
37165,0,"I do enjoy the relief these provide my hands. Used to be a problem shifting my car's stick and these help. My biggest complaint is that there is NO information. How tight is too tight? How long should these be worn? I wore them to bed one night only to awaken several hours later with the feeling my arms would fall off. I appreciate the relief but worry about potentially damaging my circulatory system over utilizing these and there is absolutely no direction or information provided to avoid problems - if there any. No info, no idea if these are completely safe or if there are concerns with tightness and length of time wearing."

67184,0,"The fit is awesome. Customized for my bite perfectly. I just can't sleep with a thick wad of gel in my mouth all night. This is not the fault of the product, but if you've never had a guard, it's tough getting used to. For the price, well worth it to try this if you don't want to spend $$ on a dentist-made one."
66385,0,"Mine arrived in an ugly brown, not the nice blue. So that is pretty bad, which reminds me of Barbara Bush's tasteless but perfectlyin character comment on the night of 9/11, the day people were jumping out of windows of the World Trade Center, that she had had to sleep on brown sheets. So there's that.Also, it is so long and big, the plastic gets all wrinkled.But, it is a heating pad. The best feature is the automatic turn-off."
218116,0,good snack if on a diet or working out.Ate these years ago they killthe hunger and not to many calories.
178730,0,"...but, when I think of an ""Ultimate Meal"", I think of a healthy, great tasting experience. Far from it with this product.After researching this and other similar products, I concluded that The Ultimate Meal is everything it claims to be...incredibly good for you. But after two weeks, I still (literally) gag when trying to drink this stuff. I started by mixing my organic fruits with it, even adding some OJ like one poster suggested (even though the label says not to). I moved on to sweeter yogurts to try and cut the terribly taste, but to no avail.If you can get past the stinging rotten pea soup odor and flavor and it doesn't bother you, I would recommend you buy this product. Otherwise, stick to the traditional vegetarian/vegan diet."
230040,2,"This is awful. It snags &amp; pulls the hairs - very painful. Bought a Norelco, much better. After only two uses, this thing is back in it's box. The only reason I'm not returning it is just in case I need an emergency back-up trimmer.Not recommended!"
100822,1,"We orded this for our 6 year old who still wets the bed at night fairly regularly. He expressed an interest in stopping so our Dr recommended a bedwetting alarm. We read all of the reviews and selected this one.The directions are poor. I thought there would be a better explanation of a plan or how to use. But we were able to figure it out. There is no off button on the device. If the alarm is going off and you want it to stop, you lift the lever. The idea is you clip the sensor to the underwear where the wetness would occur. When the alarm goes off, when they wet, they are supposed to wake up fully, shut the alarm off themselves, go potty, change, reattach alarm and go back to sleep. They need a lof of parent help af first. The key is make sure they are awake. Don't let them go thru it groggy. That is what trains the brain.My son has been wearing it for about 4 weeks. He still wets the bed at least 1 x week. But we are sticking with it. He has made progress in that the last time he wet the bed, he got up on his own, went potty with whateverurine was left, changed his own underwear, re-attached the alarm to his new dry underwear and went back to bed, all on his own without waking us. They say it can take months to work. I will give another review when he is successful. I have faith it will work for him. He doesn't wet regularly enough so I think it is taking longer."
357650,0,It seems to be working the way it is supposed to. I have not used all its features yet--mainly to basically monitor my BP.
181375,2,"I saw that this flavor was on sale and since I've tried the other three flavors and loved them, thought I'd give this a try. MISTAKE! This is by far the worst tasting of the four flavors. It has a bitter, almost metallic taste. I suppose I might be able to use it in fruit smoothies, but I definitely won't be taking it on its own like I do with the orange, orange-chocolate, or tropical flavors. Really gross, but at the same time better than a cod-liver supplement, I suppose."
303348,0,I have not had to use this as of yet as I bought it for my Mom who passed and was unable to try it.
112873,0,"Since this is the most readily available reacher in our market, we've used many of them over the years. But the plastic ""trigger"" is not very durable and always breaks within a few months. The last one we bought lasted all of three months. It wasn't abused, either. The user is a very petite woman, not a body builder with a killer grip.The second most common problem they have is the string which connects the trigger to the pincher. The knot tied in the pincher eventually comes unraveled and the string gets lost in the barrel. It's very hard to fish out. Having said that, these issues are not uncommon for reachers. it's just that this brand has very uneven life in the trigger materials."
234810,0,"We, the family are not vegetarians but I thought we could use the natural vitamins that brewers yeast contain.

98430,1,"This product really does work! It is an excellent way to carry insulin!well worth the money,"
262471,0,"I used to use this cream exclusively for my older daughter. She had eczema as an infant which cleared up by the time she was 1. Because she was nursing, I went on a wheat-free, egg-free, dairy-free, tomato-free, etc., diet plus used this cream on her rashes, and gave her a homeopathic remedy as well. This cream seemed to help heal the skin on her face and arms quickly, sometimes over night, and it didn't seem to sting, and didn't leave a greasy residue. However, after we relocated to a new city/country, my daughter broke out with eczema again at about 2.5 years old and my daughter complained that the California Baby cream would sting and it didn't seem to relieve the itching at all. The rashes are much more severe this time around and currently I am using organic virgin coconut oil and pure shea butter which seems to work a lot better. Honey also helps heal the skin if it is cracked/bleeding. My husband also broke out with sever eczema on his fingers and he says this cream doesn't seem to do anything to help with healing or itching. I have used it as face cream, though, and I love it! But I guess it's not as effective for eczema as I previously thought it would be. It seemed to work ok for light cases of eczema/dry skin but not severe cases. And definitely it cannot be used on broken or raw skin, whereas coconut oil, shea butter, and honey can. Of course using the cream is a lot less messier than using oil, butter, and honey though!"

411966,0,"It took two. plus a backup spare to mow one yard last summer! I wished it had lasted longer, OR temp had not been 90 degree plus."
62134,0,The item works but not the way the maker makes it sound. The vibrations are not that strong. Cheaper and simpler models have more power. The rabbit part is too flexible and does not allow firm pressure against the clitorous. The rotation is very small and the beads did nothing for me. In my opinion it works but there are better ones at alot less money. The battery cover also comes off while in use.
287787,0,"I read the reviews and knew I'd be getting a strongly scented soap, but thought I'd give it a try. It smells a lot like woodsmoke to me, but the odor is gone right away after I bathe. What I hadn't anticipated is that it makes my bathroom smell, especially when the bar of soap is wet. As far as cleaning, I use it for my hair, and it seems similar to other bar shampoos I've used - nothing amazing, but it does the job.I won't buy this again because of the smell, but it's not so bad I won't use up what I have."

293960,0,"I really like the idea of this product. My baby is only 5 weeks old and takes a tiny bit of Mylicon for gas. This pacifier is not made for small amounts of medicines. She never got any of it, even after sucking for quite a while. I'm hoping it will work better later on if she needs any medicaiton. I'm kind of bummed because I bought another one as a baby shower gift, an expensive pacifier at almost $10! Now I'm not even sure I want to give it to her! Others like it, so I'm hoping I will get to use it!"
405804,0,Didn't realize it was considered a toy...so that explains it's very limited magnification. The size is great and I'm sure for a youngster this would be an excellent first magnifier.
207754,2,"I received a sample pack with my pump. Love the pump but not the pads. I had already been using the lansinoh pads and liked them but ran out so I used the free ones.

Disappointed in the misadvertisement of the brand though!"
330349,0,"I've never had much luck with electric razors.

This shaver does on okay job, but this is a top of the line electric shaver and I expected more.On the positive side, it comes with a trimmer that is pretty nifty, it is extraordinarily easy to clean and is comfortable - both to the hand and to the face. The charger is easy to use and the unit tells you how many minutes and charge are left - a super-cool feature."
5646,1,"Helps my feet feel better, I also use it on my knee and it helps the pain go away there too."
54337,0,"For whatever reason, these were not as good as the ones we buy in the store. The magnetic strip came off of 1 of the 4 we ordered. On a second one, the neck separates from the wider body.

65536,0,"I ordered this variety pack after first having a box of Cookies 'n Cream builders bars. I thought that they were just Clif Bars, but apparently the builders bars are different: more protein, and more of a candy bar shape (these ""bars"" are almost nugget shaped).Beyond just the look, the bars themselves are quite different in texture. I *greatly* prefer the builders bars, to such an extent that I may try to give away the remainder of this box (I've only eaten 2 bars) and just order another box of builders bars. These bars do not look good, and though they taste alright, the texture is a big turn off for me..."

246861,0,"I used mine last winter. I was happy with it considering the price. It did its job. I tried to plug it in a few minutes ago and it no longer turns on. I believe it is still under warranty. For the price, it is not terrible that it is not working anymore, It is annoying though because it is late, I'm sick and the vaporizer would have helped and it is less than a year old. It is worth buying, but do not expect it to last forever."
349514,0,"I bought this meter two days ago and generally agree with all the positive reviews, so I will not repeat the good points here. I have two problems with the meter. One is that you cannot manually add a glucose reading into the meter. This means that you must always use the same meter for all your readings. My 5 yr old daughter with T1D takes her noon reading at school with the nurse on a different meter, so I have no way to input the readings into her Ultrasmart meter, so the averages etc are only based on morning and evening readings. So I still have to keep a written log of her noon readings. Secondly there is no way to get a list of the readings (or food or insulin) except for a list mixing up all types of input. My daughter likes to scroll through her readings on the older One Touch model; that display with big numbers would service a 5 yr old better. Also the meter is complex to use with lots of key presses needed to navigate -- defintely not for a child. In conclusion, the meter is best for adults."

51135,0,"Five years ago I bought the Braun 2170 Silk Epil (a white and yellow epilator in a silver mesh zippered bag)which was a revelation compared to the wire-coil Epilady that I had before, much less painful although it did not make the process notably quicker. However after 5 years of monthly use I thought it was getting slow, and wanted to check out a newer model, Braun 5270 Selk-epil X'elle, thinking it would be even better. I must say I am dissapointed. Somehow the new model is more painful and does not appear any more efficient than the older model. I have no use for the trimmer attachment, and the plastic sack packaging is not as nice. So I am back to using the older model as long as it lasts, and will keep the newer model as a backup."

172397,1,"I have a hard time swallowing pills and all the pre-natal vitamins I have found are HUGE. I drink a tablespoon in a half-glass of orange juice each morning and night and it's so much better then struggling to swallow a pill, especially when dealing with morning sickness. It makes the orange juice taste a little tropical and is surprisingly good. I haven't noticed an aftertaste but I do brush my teeth after drinking it each time so if there is one I am probably killing it. I took a bottle in to my OB and she looked over the label and said that it had everything that my baby and I needed.My only complaint is the bottle itself. No matter how careful I am, nearly every time I pour some out of the bottle a little dribble rolls down the side and I have to wipe it or it will get all sticky. I wish it was more pour friendly, but that's really just a little nitpicky thing."
194926,0,This is a great idea but it is made very cheaply. The mesh razor cover bent and I got scratched really badly.
246382,1,"I love these vitamins, everything you need to supplement your diet as a women and only have to take 1. I love the herbal blend and probiotics in it too.

Love these, dont have to worry about something that supposed to make me feel good, feel yucky. Get them and they are at a great price."

260355,2,"I have enjoyed other Alvita teas, so I was looking forward to the Burdock tea. I'd read that some reviewers complained that the tea was loose in the packaging. I've seen a little bit of that before and wasn't worried. My burdock tea arrived, and more than half of the tea bags were empty, with the burdock root (and magnesium powder) loose in the packaging. I don't know if the tea bags are too porous, or if they are having packaging issues, but I recommend getting this tea as loose &#34;leaf&#34; rather than in tea bags, since it won't arrive in the bags."

I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right: it applies easily and the sent lingers but isn't overly powerful. I personally got 'Peace of Mind' and it's a refreshing scent that makes me think of a 'i-just-brushed-my-teeth' feel. The price is affordable and my order came in 2 days instead of the 3-5 which i expected, especially since Christmas is so close by. You won't be disappointed."

The water output and suction leave much to be desired. Too little on both ends. I also find I have to remove the cleaning pad often to rinse, in the middle of the job. Granted I live in puppy piddleville, and in that regard it's a whole lot better than paper towels and spray. But I wish I hadn't spent the money. A mop and bucket do the same job."

75910,0,"I thought that some of the features that homedics had included in this foot massager were novel enough to give it a try. My biggest complaint is that it isn't domed enough in the middle to really massage your instep or the center of your foot. Also it really doesn't take very much pressure to slow the motor and hear it strain. The round balls are supposed to be like thumbs massaging your feet. The heat is nice though mild and not really very warming if you are wearing socks as they recommend. Overall, this is not a great product but for the price it isn't a bad product. I have the Dr. Scholl's foot massager which only vibrates your foot on a round plastic dome. While the vibrating is not as interesting as the ""thumbs"" on this, I still think Dr. Scholl made a higher quality product."

You are supposed to have these around every meal time but the sweetness wreaks havoc on your taste buds so I recommend having them after the meal not before.Yet to have a retest so don't know if they have worked.

208935,0,"I read the reviews of many pill crushers before purchasing this one. It gets 3 stars because it is priced well and the top design with the rubber cushions is good. After this - it goes downhill for me...First, at least 1/4 of the pill stays STUCK to the point after it is crushed - I've tried it many ways, it still sticks. The bottom of it KILLS my hands. I read another review that stated this and it is the same for me. The rubber on the top is a great idea - why not make the bottom the same? The plastic is such that it cuts into my hands. To solve this - just use a cloth, towel, shirt tail...whatever is handy. The last complaint is that the dust from the pill has to be knocked loose. Clumps stick to the bottom and it has to be knocked on the side to loosen it.Still - all in all - this beats crushing a pill between 2 spoons - not much - but some.... I don't mind so much the pills getting stuck as much as the design of the bottom, but that is probably why it is priced so well... As far as how it crushes... it does pulverize ;-)"
420711,0,"This is an attractive well made slide in razor, but it doesn't support the blade well. This razor leaves about 2mm - 3mm of unsupported blade sticking out which means the blade has too much flex and chatter when shaving which results in unnecessary nicks and cuts. I would recommend the Parker razors instead. They support the blade very firmly up to about 1mm from the blade edge. This results in a very smooth nick free shave. The Parker SR! and SRW perform much better than these Personna Magics."

401845,0,The product I received was exactly what I needed. My problem is the shipping. UPS broke the bottles...........The Company I purchased items from called to tell me. Thank you.

187192,0,"My old shaver was a Remington Intercept, a model that's no longer made. It shaved great and had a really useful trimmer that could trim hair, beard, sideburns, etc. Unfortunately, the battery was just plain terrible. After using it for three years, I finally replaced it with the Braun, which I got from Amazon in a Gold Box special.As I said in the title, the battery is incredible. I've taken it on vacation for a whole week and left the charger at home. But sadly, it doesn't do a very good job shaving. The foil is only about 2/3 the size of the Remington foil, and I believe that is the problem."
113910,1,"I love this shaver. I can shave every day without irritation. Because the base does the cleaning for me I don't have to worry about the condition of the blade, it's taken care off.And the digital display telling you when it needs to be cleaned is surprising accurate.I highly recommend this item."
131995,0,"It's my fault for not smelling this at the local retailer first, and I should have checked their prices first as well, but when I received my order from Amazon, I was disappointed with the smell of this. After reading other reviews, I did check out other items at the local store, and found that the Basil is really a great fresh fragrance. The Lemon Verbena is great also, but for my sensitive senses, it's a bit too much. All in all, the Mrs. Meyer's product line is really great, and I'm happy with the variety of options."
135599,2,"I'm probably the realistic target market for an item of this dimension- a male size queen. It's the right width for me, working on depth. But this isn't the right toy to do it.Y'know all those warnings on the 8-inch variation about how there's something wrong with this and it burns the exact sensitive tissues you'd be using it with? This has the exact same problem. It's too large to use condoms as a workaround.Mine was packaged plastic-sealed over a cardboard backing. The cardboard backing had a moisture stain pattern obviously related to where it was contacting the toy. There's definitely something chemically wrong with this product."

The next morning, I got up and went in the bathroom to shower, and the bar of soap was on the floor on the other side of the room! I was in a hurry so I didn't think to much of it at the time. I just picked up the soap and took a shower. Of course, when I was done, I left the soap in the shower.The next day, I got up to shower again, and the soap was on the floor again, all the way on the other side of the room!After that, I decided to get rid of it. Until I see something in the news that explains how a bar of soap can move by itself, I'll never by this soap again."
221905,0,This garcinia Plus gives you alot of energy. Not like the Garcinia 1000. I myself do not need the energy. I perfer the 1000 version. The energy is closely related to have 1 energy drink every 3 hours. Not very fun. Do not take more than 1 per day or you will most like no be able to sleep. I made the mistake and ordered this and thought why not it just has more Garcinia and a little extra stuff. No not that at all. It might not react the same for everyone. But who really knows.
205302,0,"Orgasm- 6/10 Noise- 9/10 Durability- 2/10 Intensity- 5/10So Doc Johnson, #14 was the best you could come up with. I am not entirely happy with this product. I bought this after researching squirting and looked into G-spot toys. I paid about 20 bucks for it, which was okay, not complaining about price. I received it in the mail, so excited to try it out, and BIG DISAPPOINTMENT, It didn't work. I had to call the company, get another one sent, blah blah blah. I got it, and the thing I don't really like is that it bends a little too much. Had it been the way it is and a little more sturdy, I would say this was my favorite toy. The twist handle is also not my favorite option in the world but that has held up very good compared to other toys with this type of control. The power is good. The noise is very quiet, so if you're trying to be discrete, go for this. All in all I would rate this toy a 7/10. Not the worst, but not a 10.[...]"

She was bitterley disappointed when the walker arrived as per the promised shipping time only to see it was a burgundy colour...she wanted pink. We could have bought it from riteaid straight away instead of orderering from amazon. Even the box was a different colour. Carex change your colour to what it really is and stop misleading advertising to the elderly. Shame on you.

164510,0,"I've been on a breakfast bar kick lately. Mainly because I'd like to convince myself its healthy and because I haven't had a lot of time to do my own baking. So convenience wins out quite often.This particular Luna bar is supposed to resemble a Smores. I have to say, I don't really get that flavoring, but maybe it's just me. The taste is till good, I can taste the chocolate, the crispy rice things somewhat resemble a graham cracker, but there is no marshmallow flavor to be had. And even the chocolate was fairly light as compared to the crispy rice. It was sweet, almost a little too much, but it must not have been too bad because I gobbled it right down.I did notice that this one did not fill me up as much as some of their other flavors. I was hungry maybe only two hours later and it was a long time until lunch. Some of their other bars can fill me up for longer, so I wonder if maybe a difference in ingredients accounts for this one not being as satisfying. It did seem a bit thinner in comparison to the Chocolate Dipped Coconut Bar, and the bulk of it was the crispy rice.There's more than crispy rice in this bar though. The ingredient list is quite long, although most of it is pronounceable and the label boasts that it is 70% organic. Which is actually pretty impressive. There are several allergens associated with this product, so read the label if you have questions. The fat content and calories aren't terrible, but for a smaller bar I thought they seemed a little high. It does have 9 grams of protein, which is good. And according to the package, it has 3 grams of fiber and includes calcium, folic acid, vitamin D and iron.Not my favorite of the brand, but I'd eat it again in a pinch. For the best, I'd recommend the Chocolate Dipped Coconut flavor. Overall as a brand, these are some pretty good breakfast bars.Review by M. Reynard 2012"
56115,2,"The instructions were fairly easy to follow, but the lancet was far from useful. There was not enough for even one of the 4 mixing sticks.

I found myself ripping them off my feet in the middle of the night. They are very tightly woven and much stiffer than the other brand I ordered after I found I would not be able to wear these very long. I orderedOppo Gel Heel Socks, 6790 - 1 PairThey are much softer material and not nearly so tight and they have a soft, breathable part that is across the top of the foot. They are very comfortable and I forget I have them on. Both have the gel heel and that is awesome feeling on your cracked heels!"

276661,0,"I just bought this from Amazon in Strawberry Flavor, I have to say this tastes amazing. Seriously it is like drinking strawberry milk, it's that good. I'm sure kids would drink it too if you let them (probably shouldn't). I bought this protein since BSN has a good brand perception, and this was advertised as a ""lean protein"".Well, I should have done more comparison shopping and looked up the nutrition facts.One Scoop has:190 Calories6 grams fat13 grams of carbs22 grams of proteinCompare to...Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey (one scoop)130 Calories2 grams of fat4 grams of carbs24 grams of proteinSo with Syntha-6 you have a protein that has 60 more calories, 4 more grams of fat, 9 grams more of carbs, and 2 LESS grams of protein than a similar/cheaper ON product.Now of course, the taste is incomparable. I've tried ON's whey and syntha 6 wins the taste competition hands down no questions asked. And I'm sure the 6 protein blend is great (mixture of whey, casein, egg proteins). But you can't really call this a ""lean"" protein powder when it is clearly on the high end of the calorie count.I still like this product, but I think it's more suited to those wanting to bulk/gain mass. If you want to cut down, you might want to look somewhere else."

375762,1,A little cheaply made but it does the job. My mother is a brain injured and has the use of her right arm only. This fit perfectly on her Jazzy Powerchair.

We're going to use them for my husband's work truck and he wants some for the garage too.
151197,0,"The lamp was well packaged for shipment and arrived in good order. It assembled quickly and easily. But. The connection for the bulb itself is not well executed. The design looks to be well-thought out, but the electrical path to the bulb is not tight. If my dog walks near the lamp, or just a gravity attack while the bulb is horizontal, the light goes out.A bit of gentle jiggling gets the bulb back in contact, but it is annoying.This has happened from the first time I turned on the lamp.The light, when it is on, is great."

373491,1,"I have had problems sleeping and found that melatonin and L-Tryptophan don't work for me. They cause stomach upset. I knew that valarian has worked for me in the past so when I read about this product I decided to give it a try. I like Now Food products and the price was right however I didn't notice that taurine was one of the ingredients. I have angina which I control very well with fish oil - in my case with 4 packets daily ofCoromega Omega3 Squeeze Packets, Orange, 120-CountWhich I buy via super saver on Amazon. However, taurine constricts the blood vessels so unless I take Vitamin E and the Coromega when I take the True Calm I experience mild angina symptoms.So be aware and research taurine for yourself.The good news is that I sleep very well with this product and don't mind going the extra mile to make it work. I may not buy it again and may go with another Valerian product but have a whole bottle which could last me a long time as I don't take this more than once or at most twice a week.I rarely have anxiety or stress to the point where I would need this during the day but do believe it has a relaxing affect and when used for sleeping I had normal dreams and awoke without doziness."
56470,0,"I usually get the Balance Carbwell bars (in chocolate peanut butter), and I mistakenly ordered this in peanut butter flavor.Pros- huge flavor- soft / chewy textureCons- high sugar & fat- not covered in anything (it's just peanut butter throughout -- I thought there would be a hint of chocolate at least).Other:It's way too sweet for my liking (compared to the Balance Carbwell bars).

Anyway, I'm looking for another one and I kind of want to get this one again, but I don't want to spend $60 on something that might die again in a year...."
295052,0,"I have had this product for a couple of months now. I have also used the Waterpik ""tank system"" in the past. The advantage of the Panasonic is simply convenience. It takes up very little space and is easy and fairly quick to use. The batteries have held up well.My only negatives would be:1. The pulse power, which needs to be cranked up slightly. It still does the job, but about 25% more power would give it that ""wow, it's really cleaning like crazy"" factor, which I don't really get with this, but I did get with the larger Waterpik.2. The spout at the end easily swivels around the base, so you have to maneuver it carefully and make sure it is pointed in the right direction at all times, which can be somewhat annoying.I do use this device more than I used the larger tank system from Waterpik, so in that regard I recommend it. Having something with somewhat less power that I use regularly is clearly a better value than a more powerful unit that I use rarely.On the other hand, if you don't mind the clutter on your bathroom counter and will use it just as often, I would go with the larger Waterpik system with the tank and tubes."
317005,1,"My son from the first time I changed him hated it. However since I have been using the wipes warmer which I recieved as a shower gift he does not mind being changed hardly at all. When I have to use cold wipes out of the diaper bag he screams and cries until I am done. However with the wipes from the warmer he sits there and smiles. I agree with one reviewer that the ""pop-up"" feature only works with pampers wipes from what I have seen so far, but I prefer to use only the pampers sensitve wipes anyway because they don't irritate by son's bottom. Also, I have never had any problems with wipes drying out I add a little water to the pad once a week and it works great! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep a happy baby."

167980,1,Can't beat mucinex. Great way to loosen sinus pressure. I like how it does not have the side effects that decongestants have. I can even take one at night because it is not a stimulant. Great price for the quantity.

I wasn't let down, and those little balls moving around in there do a lot more then you think! If this was just a single setting vibe, I don't think it could get me off, or at least not as well, or anywhere near as fast as this one can. My boyfriend has ED, and this may have just saved our relationship, now we can both get off instead of just him and me lying there afterwards disappointed and unfulfilled. Between the lights and all the buttons on the base he thinks it's pretty fun too to help me out. I adore this product and recommend it to anyone, especially those new to vibes...

212818,0,"It does everything as advertised. I think that possibly since it was an older unit (on sale, end of product-cycle) it doesn't hold a charge very long. Which brings up my biggest negative: since things like this are never charged when you need them, and you have to charge it FIRST, well, for my use it's not very convenient ... you have to plan ahead, but that's precisely why I'm not using a razor, because I didn't plan ahead, right?Again, it does what it advertised, but the battery life has been disappointing."

52261,0,"I have used Kali #7 for a long time and so have had several years to decide if, or how well, I think it works. I have had sinus problems all my life, which has caused me to clear my throat often, and that in turn irritates people around me. I tried lots of different remedies for this post nasal problem, including using a neti pot, which does help to an extent. But nothing really fixes the problem, including a host of medications that were prescribed for me by medical doctors. I didn't want to spend the rest of my life taking prescription medication and, obviously, that was getting expensive.A friend recommended Kali Sulph #7, which is cheap and easy to take because the tiny tablets quickly dissolve under the tongue. These little pills are convenient to use and to carry with me, so I figured I didn't have anything to lose and started using them regularly. Over the years I have come to believe that they actually do work, although like the prescription meds, they don't eliminate the problem completely. I also think that the weather can mitigate their impact -- if it is a rainy day the pills seems to work less well, probably because my sinuses are worse in wet weather.I have had no side effects from them and think they are worth trying."
40432,0,I was looking for a replacement for the Hummingbird flosser since it is nearly impossible to find tips anymore. I was hoping this would be it but in the end it was awkward to use and the floss broke easier than I would have liked. The tips are a little expensive as well.

365345,0,It worked ok. I don't have a lot of nose hair and this the first one I ever purchased so I don't have anything to compare it to. I accidently got the trimmer part stuck in the removable top and had a heck of a time getting it unstuck.

There are far better products on the market than this one, and I guess Rhodiola must be one of those ""you get what you pay for"" types of products. My doctor recommended Mind Body & Spirit. another Rhodiola, that seems to work very well, but I can't find it here on Amazon. I found out with this NOW product that not all Rhodiola's are the same."

31378,0,"I would not recommend this product. I'm not sure if the problem is the wax or the heating system but it's difficult to evenly spread out the wax and it takes a lot of time. It works but it ends up becoming extremely messy, time consuming, and not nearly as effective as having it done professionally."
315391,1,"I recently purchased White Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor as a gift. I was pleased with the item upon receipt. It was in it's original packaging, came promptly and was well below other seller's prices. It is difficult to find this item where I live sold in larger quantities and without being in a gift set.

273612,0,"**I will try to update this review after I have been using the product for a few weeks**I just received this product in the mail not twenty minutes ago. Unfortunately, AmericaRX took about 2.5 weeks to even ship it. That was a bit annoying because I had expected to have it in no more than 2 weeks.Anyway, I opened the package and immediately applied it to my face. I can see what people mean when they say it had a strong smell! It's not necessarily a bad smell; it's like a combination of herbs, menthol, and DIRT! Personally I like the smell but I can understand how some people wouldn't. I'll be applying this probably 2-3 times a day. I will update my review after I have determined it's effectiveness."
229649,0,"These are awesome toothbrushes. However, they are very expensive. The box contained only 6 toothbrushes. I thought there would be 35. Apparently the number ""35"" is the model number, not the quantity. Nowhere in the description was the actual quantity (six) actually listed. If I had known I was paying $30 for only 6 toothbrushes, I would not have ordered them."
68542,0,"Somewhere either in amazons warehouse or in transit or possibly before amazon got them this product got too hot and melted in addition to being squished. I did not leave feedback on my first order thinking possibly it was a one time thing but the second order was also squished and melted. The icing is dripped down the sides like melted wax. This is not really a problem but the chocolate on the bottom is all broken up. Quite messy and must be eaten over the sink or a garbage can. Still tastes good so still three stars, but inconvenient."
260259,0,"Things I like about this product:It doesn't use batteries like the Swiffer mop.The ability to tuck in pads means I can use reusable microfiber cloths.I can refill this bottle with a safe cleaning solution.Things I don't like about this product:The pads that come with the system are so thin, hence my want to use a microfiber cloth.The solution squirter system is a bit unpowerful. Its like the fluid drips out instead of squirting out.The pole seems a bit flimsy. I know this isn't supposed to be used for heavy duty scrubbing and cleaning but the pole cold be a bit stronger.Decent buy."

268114,0,"This was my first try at organic conditioners and it works but you do need to use a little more of it in order to get the job done. i started using a leave in detangle spray so that helps. also, organics should help the environment, plastic containers (especially when theres so many alternatives) work against that. so 3 stars, -1 for having to use more, -1 for the plastic."
334832,2,"For several years I had what seemed like a great kitchen brush with a detergent reservoir. The only problem was that the brush leaked detergent, leaving a gooey mess on my sink. With time, this problem became worse, and so I resolved to get a new brush made by a reputable company like Oxo. I researched kitchen brushes on Amazon and found a couple of promising Oxo brushes. One even looked like the one I had. Then it occurred to me to check the brush I had to see who made it. It was difficult to distinguish the name, but I finally made it out: Oxo!Avoid this brush like the plague. It looks great but is poorly designed and manufactured. While in principle the detergent reservoir is a good idea, in practice it just creates annoying messes and wastes detergent. There is another Oxo brush that appears to be much better but is also more expensive. This brush, however, is just a waste of money."

58131,0,"So I received this item as a gift from Menscience with my purchase. I mean i could never justify spending $11 for chapstick! I usually use the Burts Bee chapstick, it does an amazing job works beautifully, keeping my lips chap free and smooth!So on to the Menscience Lip Balm i have been using this chapstick for awhile now. It has a built in SPF 30 which is the standard oxybenzone and octinoxate. It also has Rosemary and Soy and Olive extracts. Interesting is contains some Cannibis sativa (hempseed) oil! First Impressions, it taste tastes and smells pretty awful. I know Menscience goes the Fragrance Free route for almost all their products and I do love that about them but I really wish they did something about this product. It does offer great protection and leaves my lips protected but the smell and taste is really unappealing. That being said I give this product a 3/5. Its totally not worth the price, and for the same protection you can go for other lip balms such as the Burts Bees(ive posted a picture of all my Menscience products to let you guys know I'm not one of those fake Menscience reviewers. More reviews to come of their products)"
210155,0,It's pretty much all hype you guys. Don't get pulled in like I did. They're just tweezers.. and they hurt. I very much prefer my Lacrosse tweezers to these.
324719,0,It gets the crayon Marking off the wall pretty well u just have to scrub for a long time depending on how bad it is. I had about 2ft x 1ft of markings and it took me about 15 minutes. But the wall looks like it has never been drawn on. And it didn't lose its color. I just don't like to strong orangey scent. As far as getting old grease off the stove nope it didn't work. That's it's a 3 for me.
353222,0,"I did not notice that the (trigger) of the reacher was so small. I already own a 26"" and wanted another one. First, I ordered the wrong size and did not realize it until I received it (my mistake). Second, I did not realize that the trigger part was so small; I assumed they were the same size as the one I own. With it being so much smaller than the one I own and the reacher being longer, it will not hook onto the back of the chair or a doorknob, which is a big inconvenience."
114906,0,I thought it was for a chair but when I receivbed it I found out it was for wheelcahirs. My father uses a wheelcahir and hates it. I do not recommend!!
48676,0,"I have three children, and I was really getting tired of rinsing so I went ahead and purchased these. When they arrived, I noticed that they weren't flushable for all types of plumbing. My husband definitely didn't want me to take the chance since we have a septic system.At first, I wasn't too disappointed and decided that I'd just use them when I took my baby in public or had to use a rash cream. However, these were so scratchy that my daughter developed a rash from them. I should state that my baby has ridiculously sensitive skin, so this probably wouldn't be a problem for everyone and I'm not giving a lower rating because of it. I just want to mention that if your baby is prone to skin irritations, these may not be for you.These are large, so they can be cut, which helps keep costs down - but they are kind of expensive for what they are. Because of my experience with these, I'm not going to bother trying any other disposable liner and will stick with reusable ones in the future."
160399,2,"I have major back pain and was looking to upgrade my regular foam filled seat cushion which cost $15. However, the product offered by Medical Department Stores as ""Coccyx Cushion"", which I purchased for $33.49 is advertised as being made of high quality standard memory foam. Once I received the product, I took it out of the plastic wrap which is the only way to test it on a chair and found that it was very stiff and stiffer than the cushion on my chair. Also, I noticed that the ticket on the cushion says its only made 1/2 of memory foam which was very poor quality, which was not even close to the standar memory foam found in pillows in the store. I contacted the company, which was hard to get through on the phone and had to leave a message that was never returned and got lucky today and got through to the appropriate person. All I did was remove the plastic wrap in order to test it out and they won't return it because the plastic wrap was removed? But this is the only way to test it out. This is not a reputable company. STAY AWAY FROM THIS INTERNET COMPANY, AS IT IS A BIG HOAX. Buy the cheaper foam filled cushion and just replace it every 1 to 2 years, which is what I'm going to do."

418308,0,"These little aluminum capsules are supposed to have a bottle inside them. The bottle was missing in two of the ones we received.No big deal as the bottles are not needed for our use, but Ithought I would warn potential buyers.The kids loved the colors. And you cannot beat the price. The pill containers at the local drug store were $4 EACH!"
225522,0,"I tried all sorts of nose hair trimmers before purchasing these. I've had 4 different electric trimmers which, I am now convinced, are all a waste of money. there is no such thing as a good electric trimmer. I also tried the Groom Mate Platinum cylindrical manual trimmer, which did trim hairs, but not at all closely. Groom Mate left nearly 1/4"" of each hair, if it trimmed, at all. Cheap, drug store, blunt tipped scissors out-performed all of the above. Rubis boasts a surgical craftsmanship far beyond any other nose scissors or trimmer that I have found. The big problem with the Rubis scissors is how thick they are. Amazon does not provide a close-up image of the blade tips, which are more than 1/8 inch thick. So, while these scissors will cut the thickest and the most fine of hairs, my drug-store cheap scissors trimmed the hair nearer to the skin. The cheap drug store versions loosened up to uselessness within a few weeks, but they had flat blades and didn't cost thirty dollars. I'm still looking for the perfect scissors. I recommend the Rubis scissors only to people with thick old-man hair growing like a bush from the nose and ears. It should be perfect for that. Trim your bushy eyebrows with it. However, someone with fine, metro, personal grooming should get something cheaper with a flat tip. Amazon was great."
294824,0,The concept is great -- concentrated energy in a tasty bar -- but they are so tough and chewy -- ever tried to eat one halfway thru a hike? It's like trying to swallow cardboard -- I need to drink ALOT of liquid when I have one of these bars -- why not make then juicier???This would be good in a camp setting-- it takes alot of chews to really get this one down.If you have any loose dental work -- use the goo or the gel instead.
365001,0,It works as advertised really well its just that i vibrates alot and the sensation of having that kind of thing in your nose takes some getting used to. The vacuum works extremely well as well. as someone that hates seeing the hair shaving on my bathroom counter tops it is a welcome feature.
272953,0,I'm a little past a month and a half of taking fertilaid for women. So far I haven't ovulated or had a period. I'm going to stick with it for the three months and hope that it works. I'm not expecting to necessarily get pregnant just because I'm taking this product but regulating my periods would be awesome since I have not had one at all for over 100 days. I am hopeful that something in this product will kick in soon. Either way I will update at the end of month 3.
53340,0,"I've had a sonicare for 5 years and really liked how it worked before it finally died and I was unable to change the battery because it was too hard to pry the handle apart without breaking it so I was forced to buy another one... I bought this one because it's cheaper than the other ones. The only disadvantage is that this model doesn't prompt you to change brushing zones every 30 seconds like the more expensive ones do, which can be a bit annoying if you don't have a clock next to your sink. Otherwise, it does the same job as my older model. It all comes down to if you want that 30-second prompt, paying up to 20 more bucks or not."
134657,0,"The unit works fine and is easy to use. I seems a little flimsy. There is no place to store the piks that we use every day, just specific spaces for all the special ones. We have not had the unit very long and are hoping not to have the problems of motors burning out or other things that previous reviewers complained about."
184304,0,"I bought this per recommendation of my naturopath since fish oil capsules always leave me with that fishy taste. Maybe my taste buds are overly sensitive, but this stuff still just leaves a nasty fishy taste in my mouth...I even tried covering it up in a shake made with a protein powder, raspberry powder and more raspberries and all I taste is fish. I'd rather take a spoonful of fish oil straight than try to cover up the fishy taste with berries and ruin that."
305099,0,"I know people who have had luck with this, so I decided to give it a try.Unfortunately, it hasn't worked for me at all. It makes no difference if I take it or I don't.On the positive side of things...1. These are not as addictive as normal sleeping pills (not as effective for most either)2. It's a natural precursor to melatonin, so it promotes your body to create what it needs to go to sleep. It doesn't provide it directly, so it's a more natural way for the body to shut itself down.3. Virtually no side effectsDespite the fact that it didn't work for me, I can't give it 0 stars because I know of people who use it and it works well for them. Plus it's a much healthier, less addictive alternative to normal sleeping pills."
205005,0,It doesn't deliver the expected level of statisfaction. Now as powerful as it should be for the design and use.
78959,0,"pros: Reduced pain, and comfortable to wear.This splint definitely helped with the pain I was experiencing. When I used this splint I had very little to no pain the next morning, and while my pain would eventually return after several hours of being on my feet, it was usually not as bad as before I started using the splint. On the handful of occasions when I decided not to use the splint (typically just because I was very sleepy and didn't feel like bothering with it) the pain I had the next day was so awful I could barely walk in the morning and felt like crying towards the end of my shift at work. So, reduced pain? Check. I was also very happy to find I had very little trouble sleeping or walking around the house while wearing the splint. I had been worried that I wouldn't be able to sleep with it on and that I would have to take it off and put it back on every time I needed to get up in the middle of the night, but that was not the case. It is different, of course, sleeping or walking with your foot in this splint, but it is also fairly easy and comfortable.cons: Gives only a mild stretch, poorly constructed.The part that goes around your foot was too big on me (I'm a woman with a size 8 wide foot) and I felt it would have helped me get a better stretch if it had been tighter. And unlike some other night splints, you can't adjust this one to increase the stretch. I didn't feel like it was holding my foot at a 90 degree angle, it felt too relaxed. Also, the two straps that go around your leg were a bit of a pain. They sort of dug into my skin and I always had to wear long socks under the splint. The bottom strap stayed in place well, but the top strap tended to slide down my calf, making it looser. The straps have to be very tight or the splint won't hold your foot in the right position. The bottom strap came off after maybe a month of use. After that, I started wrapping an ace bandage around my leg to hold the front part of the brace tightly to my leg, which worked well, no more slipping and loosening. Unfortunately, I began to develop a permanent red patch of skin on the front of my leg as a result of the tight bandaging, so I had to stop using it. I now use a different night splint which is not as comfortable to wear."
107116,0,"This insole is very thick so beware if your going to put in a tight fitting shoe. The insole is very cushioned. I love the cushioning I feel when I'm doing plyometrics and playing sports in these. However, the arch is odd and a little irritating (it feels like its in the wrong place and wrong height). Great for usage for short durations (3 hours max) but for longer durations such as standing, working, running, this may not be the best option."

190739,0,"This brace is made of comfortable canvas material, but the metal bracing insert is shaped in a puzzling and uncomfortable way.It offers some level of support, but with the bad insert shape it's hard to recommend it because I've tried some other braces that while not necessarily being made of a material as comfortable as this brace have a more comfortable bracing shape to them."

Where the sling bends its starting to rip on both bends and as a few of the other commenters said and I agree she keeps sliding down. I like the depth of this tub.

232255,0,"The trimmer works OK, but not great. You have to spend some time at it for it to do a thorough job. Some hairs just don't want to go inside the guard. If they don't, they don't get cut. you also need a separate flashlight to see how you're doing. The one on the unit doesn't work that well. For $12 I'm not going to complain too much, but I'll spend a bit more money the next time and see if I can get a unit that works a little better."

150168,0,"Full Disclosure: I am comparing this protein powder more or less directly to the Cytosport Whey Vanilla Protein commonly found at CostCo. This is simply because the Cytosport bag is what I had used directly before.ON vanilla whey protein has a relatively neutral taste, but is largely unsweetened. This leaves it tasting bland unless combined with something deliberately sweet. Additionally, it tends to clump both in water and milk, which is frustrating to me after using the Cytosport, which dissolved quite nicely in water, at least.In short, it'll do, but it's not the best I've ever used. If you have a use for it (baking, perhaps?) which requires it to not be too sweet, it may be perfect. For the usual shakes and quick mixes, however, I'll be going back to Cytosport, which is cheaper at CostCo anyway."
87097,0,"Most reviewers rate this product with 5 stars, which is why I purchased it. Unfortunately, I can't use it on the carpet with the pet issue, because it is not recommended for Berber or wool.

400760,0,This brush is good. I don't know how it compares with other power brushes but my teeth feel clean when done. The whole family has been enjoying it. A big plus is it is a little easier to get my son into brush his teeth. The big drawback at the moment is I can't find replacement brushes.
42092,0,"I only ended up using this a handful of times in my 6th & 7th months of pregnancy. It fit tightly (and I was just barely in the low end of the weight guide sizing wise), was extremely cumbersome to try to put on, was uncomfortable in the underbelly area, and dug into my lower back as well.

Being used by someone who is approximately 160 lbs...I don't think this is the best cushion for pressure sore relief....jell cushion might be better. This cushion already is starting to compress and not bounce back to it's original thickness. Better than nothing for now but I am still looking.

172455,1,"I actually bought this wheelchair and brought it over with me to Hong Kong for my 90-year-old mother. It is extremely light and well made. It is the second lightest transporter wheelchair out there. It's so easy to collapse and open. I particularly liked that fact that it is 17"" wide rather than the standard 19"". My mother is very thin so this was fine. I just thought it's hard enough to get through doorways as it is, the narrower (if the person can fit in it) the better. DO take that into consideration! The only other transporter that is lighter than this one is made from Medline, called the featherlite transporter (or something like that) at under 15lbs...but it is 19"" wide. This wheelchair is 19 lbs and it still felt really light to me. I'm only 5'3"" tall, and I had no trouble pushing my mom around.I bought this chair along with a cushion. DO get a cushion because transporter chairs don't have much support for the tushie. The other thing to be aware of are the foot rest. They do flop around once you fold up the chair. I recommend getting a small zippered nylon tote bag that is small enough to hold the foot rest and store in the back chair's pocket when not in use. The foot rests are very easy to remove. But they can fall out when not in use. So get a small carrying bag for them.The nylon fabric is sturdy and well-made. The only thing that I wished it had was a lock latch for the foot rest when not in use, and maybe a carrying bag to stuff it in for transport...but that's pretty minor."
425944,0,I bought these tights to give me some mild support during pregnancy. The material is sturdy and does not run despite constant pulling and tugging. This is because the stomach and crotch are too loose and require frequent readjustment. I would either order one side smaller or the thera firma brand which is just as sturdy and stays in place.

358384,0,"Over the years I found that rotary shavers did not give me a close enough shave. The Remington floating head did give a close shave but they use an ablative carbon steel that leaves the black carbon lubricant on your face after each shave.Braun's floating head rechargeable shaver was my favorite for many years as long as replacement screens and combs were available. When that line was dropped, the replacement shaver had an inferior rechargeable battery. Initially it would not run long enough. Then it gradually got longer and longer runs. Then it gradually got shorter and shorter runs until it was useless within a year. What a waste of money.That is when I found that Braun had the same excellent head on a shaver (PocketGo) where I could use store-bought long life alkaline batteries. That solved the problem for many years... that is up to now. The latest version of the PocketGo shaver P-70 seems to have the same problem as the Remington shavers - an irritating black powder coming off the blades and getting all over my face and towels. Cleaning the shaver screen and comb and with soap and water has no effect.I invite suggestions for a new shaver that shaves nearly as well as blade, has a rechargeable/replaceable battery that will run for hours and produces no black powder from comb to foil wear and tear."

41465,0,"These things work and wear well. My one complaint is the &#34;stickiness&#34; of the arch support insert. Can't it be made of a material that is smoother, more like the rest of the orthodic? When wearing these in shoes with socks (the major mode of use for me), my sock catches on the arch support. ThIs causes my sock to be pulled so tightly againt my toes that it hurts until the sock stretches. They offer a smoothe insole to be placed over the orthodic and I've tried it. While it does make it easier to get my socked foot into the shoe, it creates additional problems. One, it makes the shoe fit even tighter. Two, it squeaks when you walk."

If you are looking for a collar to wear regularly, this is NOT the one you want. If you (like I was) are looking for one that you can keep in your trauma kit or first aid kit, then this collar will work fine for you.Also bear in mind that this doesn't have much adjustment, so know what sizes you'll need and order accordingly (or spend the money on a high-dollar, adjusts-for-everyone model)."

Emptying it out proved to be a challenge since I had to use a plastic knife to fish out some debris stuck between the opening and where it empties into the reservoir.

56591,0,"I'm extremely allergic, and was excited about this product. I followed the directions on the lable, and applied it 15 min bf I went outside. I put it on with the intent of getting rid of the poison ivy in my yard. Once I started working I noticed that where I applied the lotion on my arms, it started to get warm and burn a little, after about 30 min. of working, the sensation was worrisome. I washed it off and the next day had a light poison ivy rash. It wasn't nearly as bad as it has been in the past, so it does work some, but not completely when in direct contact, and for me, not without some side effect."
290860,0,This stuff smells awful... I'm still taking it. I'm not taking it as often as suggested though so I'm not getting the full benefits of the Spirulina.I have to hold my breathe when I take these though... it's an awful fishy/fish food smell... there is no taste going down though.

I kept the Remington for the dog, he's not particular!"
92945,0,"I was hoping the colors would blend smoothly from one to the next and that the dimmable feature would be a seperate setting. That's not how this nightlight works. When allowed to rotate through the colors, the light fades up to one color at full brightness, waits about 15 seconds, and then fades down to black before fading back up with the next color. The effect is not very soothing since you are going from very bright to pitch black every 15 seconds. You can pick a single color and brightness to lock it to but that's not what I was hoping for."
10333,2,"The package came with a few leaking batteries (pictures uploaded), and what first comes to my mind is that they have been in that package for a long time. I didn't get a chance to test the remaining batteries. The appearance is ok, but I'm not so sure about their quality once many batteries were covered by a white powder and some viscous liquid (I presumed is the battery acid leak). Lesson learned, next time I'll consider getting fresh batteries at a local store, where you can check expiration date, package and batteries conditions, etc before you buy it."
357423,0,"According the box Holy Basil is supposed to 'uplift, calm and balance'. Sounded good to me, but I also noted the caution ""As with any dietary or herbal supplement, you should advise your health care practitioner of the use of this product.""OK, so I didn't ask my doctor, I just took two capsules (as suggested on the package) in the middle of my evening meal. Within 15 minutes I felt 'spacey' or some might say 'high'. I currently do not take any other prescription drugs and/or supplements, nor had I had any alcohol. The sensation lasted for a few hours, accompanied by a burning sensation in my stomach. I felt tired too, but it was evening time so that may or may not have been associated with the Holy Basil.My take on this supplement is that it does act as a mood elevator, but if combined with alcohol (a depressant), you may get a different effect, as you may if already taking anti-depressants or anti-anxiety drugs by prescription. There are no warnings about this on the box. There is only the 'caution' and recommendation to advise your health care professional.NOTE: If you are taking other mood altering prescription drugs be sure to call your doctor first and ask if it's OK. I think you could have big problems mixing some prescriptions with this supplement.I'd suggest if you are trying Holy Basil for the first time, take 1... NOT 2... and see how it goes. You may find that over time 1 is enough to gain the desired affect. I have found that my system is fairly sensitive to any medications and/or supplements that affect mood, and often feel 'altered' by them in a way that would impair my driving. Again, no warning to that effect on this product, but something to consider.This supplement should not be given to kids! I know there are those who would dispute this, but please, if you're considering it, contact a pediatrician and ask them about if it's good for YOUR child. Age, weight, overall health (mental and physical) issues all should be considered when taking any supplements.In all honesty I will probably not continue taking Holy Basil. New Chapter makes excellent products and this is no exception, but I did not find the sensation 'uplifting or calming' in the least, so I'll keep looking for what works for me."
71229,0,This product is okay and does work but not as long as it says which is 12 hrs with a dime size amount which is recommended. The cost is excellent but this product dries you out. You have no natural lubrication and has a gritty feel to it. Using a lubricant seems to loosen the effects some.

168037,0,"Although the company advertised a 100 count ""bottle"" they shipped 100 individually wrapped pills.

84568,0,"Don't get me wrong....this monitor is great, easy to use and fairly accurate. I just wouldn't completely rely on the results it gives. After trying for a couple months to concieve our 2nd child, I invested in this monitor thinking it would save a little time and heartache. We used the monitor religiously for 7 months and still nothing was happening. I began to feel frustrated, especially after reading all of the reviews of others getting pregnant after the first or second month. I purchased the book ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" and read about all of the other signs I should be watching for (ie. cervical fluid, BBT, etc.). I found this extremely helpful and used the book in conjunction with the monitor. Basically, I found that the monitor was telling me that my ""Peak"" day was earlier than it actually was. Because I was solely relying on the monitor to tell me what days we should be trying, we stopped trying once the monitor stated our peak day was over. That was the mistake that kept us from conceiving. Bottom line: Great tool to use along with other methods, but don't take the results too literally. I'm happy to say that we did concieve and are expecting another little boy. Good Luck!"
936,0,"I bought one of these after my second Sonic Care died within a year. The toothbrush does not clean quite as well as a Sonic Care but it is much better than a manual toothbrush. You don't need to spend the kind of money they are offering them for here however. Found mine at a ""big box"" for a lot less money. You might also want to consider an Oral B sonic for about $24 at a big box."
333953,2,"Several years ago, I purchased the prior version of this device and loved it. Small, easy transportable, easy to clean. So, when it finally died, I bought the 360W without a moments hesitation.Absolutely awful. Where to start. The prior version folded into a neat little package slightly larger than a deck of cards. This thing is significantly larger, making it very difficult to pack. Because its weird and bulky shape, it has twice caught the attention of airport security. For the old unit, you shook it out, dried it with a paper towel and the world was beautiful. In the 360W you cannot remove the water reserve to dry it. I dread the thought of what is growing inside.The prior unit had a very small nozzle on the end of a flexible cord that allowed easy maneuverability to hard to get places. This thing is like moving a baseball bat around inside your mouth. I have to travel periodically out of country so I was really amazed to discover that, unlike almost any other small personal appliance, the power connection was not dual voltage compliant. Essentially useless in Europe or the middle east.After about two months usage, the battery appears to be slowly dying.Actively looking for something, ANYTHING, that will work as efficiently as the old water pic or, at least, better than this bulky, unsanitary clunker."
267345,0,This oral irrigator works well and has a brisk pulsating stream of water when the batteries are fresh (although it holds less than a cup of water). After about a week and a half the batters start to die and the pulsations are less strong. I have paid for the unit about 10 times over with just buying batteries along. I'm going for the standard now. This is okay if you want to take an small unit along to use traveling or at work. But I don't advise using it every day unless you own a battery recharger.
368807,0,"When my wife broke my former beard trimmer I attempted to find a replacement at various local stores and was sadly disappointed at the lack of selection. Amazon offered the best selection and this product caught my eye mainly because Panasonic is a brand I trust. Having used the item for several weeks I'm adjusting to it.Pros: Holds a charge and offers MANY trim settings!Cons: Recharging base is bulky, the blade angle requires adjustment when operating without the trim guard and removing the trim guard is somewhat challenging.All-in-all the trimmer works great and I'm hoping will prove to live up to Panasonic's reputation for longevity."

417343,0,"I am writing a review of three toilet cleaning systems I've bought here on amazon:Fluidmaster:Uses a cartridge containing a chlorine based tablet.Cartridge is not meant to be refilled.Chlorine odor noticeable in the bathroom.Cartridge can be modified (I used a dremel) so it is easily refilled.NeverScrub:Uses a cartridge containing a chlorine based crystal.Cartridge is not meant to be refilled.Chlorine odor noticeable in the bathroom.Kaboom:Does not use a cartridge. Bromine tablet refill inserts directly by unscrewing a cap.No odor noticeable in the bathroom.All three of these systems work the same way and all are really easy to install. All of them put a toilet cleaning chemical (tablets or crystals) in-line between the water fill valve and the toilet bowl fill pipe. All of them prevent the chemical from getting into the tank water (so there is no damage to the plastic parts in the tank). All sell refills for their systems. All keep the toilet bowl equally clean for about 1-3 months depending on how often it is flushed.Amazon also sells Pool/Spa Cleaning Chlorine and Bromine tablets, which as far as I can tell do just as good a job keeping the toilets clean as the refills but at a fraction of the cost. I have tried all of the following, each of which provide enough tablets to keep all the toilets in the house clean for 10 years and they are all very cheap:Kem-Tek 177:The tablets fit well in the dremel-tool modified Fluidmaster cartridges.The tablets fit well in the Kaboom.The bathroom has a slight chlorine odor.Spa-Kem 267:The tablets are too large to fit in the Fluidmaster cartridges.The tablets fit well in the Kaboom.No odor.Tropi Clear:The tablets fit well in the dremel-tool modified Fluidmaster cartridges.The tablets fit well in the Kaboom.No odor.Chlorine and Bromine are fairly equal in cleaning ability. Chlorine has that chlorine odor. Bromine is broken down by sunlight. Which is why, on a sunny day, outdoor pools use chlorine. But at night, or indoors, or on a cloudy day, they use bromine since there is no smell.Summary. TheFluidmastersystem works but the cartridges are expensive. To refill the cartridges easily requires a small modification with a dremel tool. The cartridge is too small for any tablets larger than 1 inch in diameter. The NeverScrub system also works but the cartridges are expensive. What I am using is theKaboomsystem with the bromine tablets (either theTropi Clearor theSpa-Kem 267) as they have no odor and clean just as well as the chlorine tablets."

216561,0,"I like these cups, as I feel like I am not contaminating the earth with harmful chemicals and contributing to landfills. The fact that they are biodegradable and made of sugar cane fiber is awesome-- I'm proud of the company for coming up with this idea to help us eliminate the waste we produce. I only hope that products like this will be used by more and more people.There is nothing wrong with each individual cup-- it looks rustic but cute. It works for both hot and cold liquids; however, if you have boiling hot liquid you will need to be careful since the cup isn't insulated and you will feel the heat in your hands quickly.The ONLY downside of these cups (and the reason for 3 stars rather than 5) is that they terribly stick together. It is a huge problem. The cups (obviously) arrive stacked together, and so when you try to pull out each individual cup from the other-- it doesn't come out! The only way I have found to pry a cup apart from the others is to bend inward the edges and pinch it together and pull (which tears the lip of the cup). That's the only way to get them apart. So at the end, you have a partially torn cup. It's a huge design flaw, which they would have to change in order for me to recommend this product. It doesn't matter too much for me personally, since I live alone at present and don't really care about the appearance-- but I'm sure I wouldn't feel good giving a torn bent up (used-looking) cup to someone else who comes to visit.Would I buy this product again? Yes, because I care about earth-friendly products. However, if there was another company that sold a similar biodegradable cup that didn't have this sticking problem, I'd switch over in a heartbeat. So the company needs to fix this problem to be successful with this product. I know I'm crazy to write such a long review on a cup, but I think it will help others to know what they are buying to see if it is worth for them. I only have a problem with this company's cups. Their other products-- sugar cane bowls and plates-- are great."

288299,1,These use the same blades as the professional grade t-outliners and with any blade like this you have to adjust it. I had some of these a few years ago before I started buying the professional grade and they do what they are supposed to as long as they are adjusted properly. Recently I bought another pair just for dry shaving because I remember how good they worked for me. I even would use my originals for a crispy line. To me these are better for shaving than the professional grey outliners. I don't know why but they are. The only issue I have is the cord does go out eventually as is the case with any corded trimmer/clipper rated for home use. That is the reason I switched to pro-grade trimmers and clippers.

The instructions indicated that you should take about 6 softgels the first time and reduce it to 1 or 2 a day after that. Frankly that is a bit spooky for me. I took 2 the first time. Perhaps that is why I do not feel any different. I actually had a bit of a stomach problem after taking the gels but can't determine if it was something else I ate."
388539,0,I decided to start this program the day after Easter. I must say I was suprised at how I didn't feel hungry and how easy it was to pass up all the left over sweets at home and at the office. I woke up on the second day feeling more refreshed then I have in a long time. Half way into my second day I started to feel dizzy though and had a small bowl of oatmeal and fruit. I only lasted a day and a half but found it very helpful to reconnecting with my true hunger compared to my mental cravings. I plan to use the rest of the kit in one day increments when I need it again. The only real downfall to the product is the number of pills you need to swallow. I was so tired of swallowing that I found it difficult to take all the recommended product. I would have given it a higher rating if not for all the pills you needed to take.
301522,0,"If you've got a drawer full of storage container odds and ends, that you just don't know what do do with, Smart Spin could be the answer.Even though this product seems to do it's job, I have mixed feelings about the Smart Spin Storage System. On one hand it really helps keeps the plastic storage container mess under control but on the other hand, like so many other products that are offered initially on TV, the quality is poor.The Smart Spin Storage System consists of a pull out lazy susan style base divided into four storage areas through the use of eight ultra cheap snap in guides and twenty -four equally chintzy containers, with tops. The containers come in three sizes, 8, 16 and 24 ounces. The containers are designed so the tops will interchange with all three sizes.Each of the three container types is stacked upside down in one of the four partitions and the twenty-four all purpose tops go in the forth partition.What's GoodThe Smart Spin Storage System provides a method of getting a handle on the usually unwieldy plastic storage container situation. You need only dedicate about a twelve by twelve inch space in your cabinets and you have instant organization. It is neat appearing and very functional.The fact that the base pulls out about half way, allows you to spin the base to the item you want and pull it out upward and beyond the guides, without conflicting with cabinet shelves.The containers themselves appear to be dishwasher friendly, though I wouldn't put them on the bottom shelf where most heating/drying coils reside.The price of approximately $20 seems reasonable though you could probably get more for your money but without the functionality with Glad or other store bought containers.What's NotAlmost everything has a downside and Smart Spin Storage System is no exception. The quality of the merchandise requires kid gloves. It's flimsy and the containers and tops are made of a thin gauge plastic. I've had this system a little over a month and one of the containers cracked for no apparent reason.The fact that the containers are designed to use one size fits all tops sounds like a good idea and it is but there are drawbacks as well. Each container is roughly four inches square at the top tapering down to about three inches at the base to allow for stacking. The eight ounce container is only one and a half inches high and the twelve ounce one is three inches high but the twenty-four ounce container is five and a half inches high.If you just want to use the units for storage alone, that's not a problem but if you, like me, like to use the storage container to make a large batch of, say tuna salad, the narrow deep container makes it difficult to mix the concoction together and needs to be made in lifts.ConclusionA lot of thought went into this product and it is a good idea but the fact that it is made from flimsy materials and that it's functionality is good but not ironclad, means to me that I will still need to retain additional storage units for larger quantities and wide shallow units for tuna and egg salad etc.Other than the quality issue, Smart Spin Storage System has a minimal of limitations and should still be helpful and find a place in your kitchen. With this in mind I recommend this product."

46242,0,"After two years of only moderate and intermittent usage, I replaced the foil and inner blade on my shaver, and immediately I noticed a difference. However, even with both of them brand new, and even with my skin as primed as possible with the steam of the shower, I still get only a moderate shave, and only if I shave at least once a day; if I skip a day, or even if I'm a little late, it can't handle even the slightest buildup."

The only reall difference is that it gives you the color code when it returns the result for ok or fever.The back end where it stores the other parts is not the beset quality, if you are fairly strong you will pull it out too far each time as I do and that gets fairly annoying sometimes.Also its not terribly easy to switch the ends/leads out or to even put one on in the first place, you need to have light and they only fit in one way."

39866,2,"After a few days of heavy use one of the suction cups on the end fell off. I screwed it back on but it fell off again a few hours later. The plastic hole that the screw fit into was cracked (it is not a metal nut and bolt, it is just a metal screw into plastic) and not usable anymore.These things are very cheaply made. I was talking to my mother and she said exactly the same thing happened to her.You will be tempted to buy these things because they are really cheap. But if you are stuck at home, unable to bend over or reach for things, and if this is your only reacher -- and it suddenly stops working -- then you are really, really stuck. (I am recovering from hip surgery. Fortunately I have some other reachers. (Another one I have is called EZ-Grabber -- it is almost as cheaply made as the Gopher but it uses metal nuts and bolts.)"

160971,2,"When I helped clean house for a sick friend of mine a few times, she had a Clorox toilet wand and I liked how easy it was to use and that I only had to store the wand instead of a full brush and caddy. So I decided to get one. But I bought the Scrubbing Bubbles one instead because I had a coupon. What a mistake! The design of this thing is horrible. You need your hands to snap the brush in as securely as possible because of the way it pivots. That means your touching the cleaner, or changing your gloves afterward. Then, you can only gently wipe the bowl with it. If you try to scrub, the brush falls off when you get to a curved part of the bowl. I ended up using 4 brushes to clean two toilets last weekend, and the same this weekend. I also end up getting my hands wet with toilet water as I fish the fallen pads out of the toilet. I hate this product, and do not recommend it to anyone."

318105,0,"The New Speed XL systems work ok but remember, this is very subjective as faces differ. I've tested several of the Speed Xl series and found them all adequate provided I don't press too firmly. They can quickly irritate the skin or actually cut. Not sensitive skin friendly by any means. This shaver has 3 rows of rotating blades which cut perfectly well but don't do as well as a good foil shaver in my case, even after the 21 day recommended break in period. You might need that much time to adjust but you'll know up front how any shaver will perform new as it is the sharpest. There is a lot of plastic and cheap feel but the heads and motor seem well built. I compared this shaver to my Panasonic pro curve linear and Braun activator. Both shavers did much better overall than the Norelco. The Braun is decent but the head quality is not the best. The Panasonic, on the other hand, did very well and seemed much better in quality. There's nothing really wrong with the Norelco and I can recommend it if you must have a rotary. If you don't, the Panasonic is the best going. Meanwhile the Norelco must be used with care and they're a bit pricey. Make sure to stock up on Remington's shaver saver spray. It sharpens and lubes the heads of any good shaver and lengthens life of the head. As always, follow the directions."
254245,0,"I was so excited to get this product. I like a strong vibration and generally pick toys based on the strength of their buzz but this is way too intense for me, even on the low setting (which is one of only 2 settings). I can't even imagine turning it up to high. It works great though for its intended purpose of a back massager. I might buy an attachment (Two Attachments G-spot and Straight Personal Massager Attachments for Hitachi Magic Vibrators) and/or theHitachi Magic Wand Variable Speed Controller - Boost Your Wand!.I might just need to use it a few more times to get used to it. *TMI Warning* The first time I used it, I could hardly touch it against myself and after less than a minute or 2, I started getting that weird itchy, tingly feeling you get from really strong mechanical vibrations. The second time I used it, I used my favorite toy, theLELO Gigi Personal Massager, Rose, first as a ""warm up"" and finished with the Hitachi. That time was much more enjoyable but I still wasn't able to touch it directly to myself (I had my fingers between me and the toy).Bottom line, I feel it's probably a little bit of overkill when it comes to the strength of the vibrations but if I had a controller that allowed me to work up to the higher speeds, I think it would be perfect. Definitely not disappointed, but not impressed.02/12/2012 Follow Up: Being electric, it can be tricky to wash and I ended up killing mine a couple months ago. I immediately replaced it (within a couple days). It's become my favorite toy. It's still really strong so if you don't like strong vibrations, it's not for you. Or only use it on your back.Also, soon after purchasing the wand, I did buy the attachments I mentioned above. They're okay but while using the attachment, it takes the focus off the clit. Take that how you will. The problem I have with the attachment is when I attach it, it makes the already loud buzzing from the Hitachi sound like a jet engine in my bedroom."

Yes, PARAFFIN.

And do you have ANY idea how disgustingly dirty your hands and fingers can be? Just so you know, there are more germs there than anywhere on your body. So how do you think a girl feels about me sticking my entire first in her private places? Probably a little taken aback, I would say. Well Ive had the problem for years that regular condoms dont fit over my fist, and then I was told about Magnums. Bigger than any condoms on the market, for the ""extra large"" male. My friend assured me, ""Dude these things are so big, you could stick your fist in them and just go at it. I keep them in my car so that women to get in, see them, and are impressed. Of course I could never actually use one haha."" Well I took those words to heart, and I purchased the monster pack of 100 to go for a test drive. I figured they would last me a few days and I could then buy them by the truckload.Well good thing I just bought 100. Because after destroying a good 50, I realized these were never gonna work. When will the sexual disease prevention organizations finally realize there are men out there who need condoms bigger than any male genitalia could fit? We need fist, or even ARM size condoms. And until that day is finally here, I'm afraid I'll be out there, wandering those streets, and spreading God knows what, to God knows who.However I couldnt rate it a 1, but how so I wanted to. For I know that for other practical purposes, these condoms will work just fine. And if a woman is satisfied by something that is small enough to not break through these babies, good for her.

48376,0,"I bought these ankle supports because I like to have a little extra support when playing basketball. I was looking for an ankle support that was light, not bulky, and provided good/moderate support... This product delivered in two out of the three categories. It's light, it's not bulky when wearing shoes, but it provides very minimal support. It is basically an overpriced neoprene ankle support because the strap doesn't do anything for the ankle. While the material that the product is made of is very good, the design is not so good. The strap is attached to the medial part of the foot, it then wraps underneath the food, back across the top of the foot to the inside/medial part of the ankle, and then around the high part of the ankle. As seen in the picture, the strap does not cover the outside/distal part of the ankle. Unfortunately, when most people roll their ankle it strains that same outside/distal part of the ankle. My biggest and perhaps only problem with this product is that the strap does nothing to protect the most susceptible part of the ankle.Overall, this is a well constructed product that has some design flaws. It would be good for very light exercise but those needing better than ok ankle protection should look elsewhere (lace up ankle braces)."

It does work in this situation, but it takes a lot more effort to flatten out the area so it can grab the hair."

69811,0,"This cushion is nicely made and has a removable cover that can be washed. However, if this is the ""thin style"" I'd hate to see what the regular or thick style looks like. I couldn't adjust my car seat rearward enough to compensate for how thick the back cusion is. I couldn't use it so I gave it to my wife who uses it for her desk chair. Before you buy one of these make sure you can move your car seat rearward at least 3-4 inches."
75980,0,"Maybe I've just spoiled her over the years, but she did not like the way this unit operated. I liked it, but that could be due to me being a guy and it being relatively easy to please me regardless. One of the things my wife did complain about was the unit tended to ""pinch"" her feet with the opposite movement of the ball wheels. I did notice the balls themselves where plastic with a chrome-like finish on them. Not the most impressive material decision. Overall, I believe your satisfaction will be based on your previous experience with foot massages and your own expectations."

154517,0,"I've had two and absolutely loved them, but am moving on to another brand. Both of the mine had the hose come apart at the base of the hand-held section after just over a year, rendering them useless. I even starting switching the second unit from one side of the sink to the other every few nights in case I was straining one part of the hose by always using it in the same position. I realize that $50 for over a year of nightly water picking isn't that bad considering I've cut down on my trips to the dentist and have very healthy teeth and gums now (I don't know how I lived without one for decades; I bought a portable water pik for vacations so I didn't have to suffer a night without one!), but I am in search of a better design.(I have two fine motors and water basisns for free if anyone needs them.)"

52791,0,"I love the toothbrush, although it does have a strong buzzing vibration to it.One day I was measuring electro-magnetic fields using the ""Extech 480823"" meter, which I bought from Amazon. I was surprised that the Sonicare Elite's reading was OFF THE CHART, producing over 200 milligauss. I have no idea if this is dangerous, but it's more than 10x stronger than a hair dryer -- and it's right next to your head.I would like to know if the Braun Oral B is similar. Can anyone take a measurement? Our battery powered $5 electric toothbrush produced no significant fields."
99656,0,"I haven't used other brands of tape, so I don't know if it's this particular one, or all of them in general, but I was somewhat disappointed. My doctor recommended I try kineseo tape as an alternative to a brace for severe carpal tunnel in my hand/wrist, so I gave it a shot. The second it gets wet (or rubs on your clothing for a few hours), it will un-stick and peel off with the ends fraying terribly and collecting every possible hair/lint/dust particle within breathing distance.That said - before it's wet, it works REALLY well, with just the right amount of stretch and support. So if you don't plan on washing your hands or showering for a few days, or if you're just using it for sports, this may be for you - it was super effective when freshly applied and dry. As an alternative to a daily/nightly brace, I wouldn't recommend because removing the old and re-applying each day ends up being a somewhat temporary and expensive solution."
411373,0,"I ordered this cushion and thought I was going to be pleased by the reviews...it turned out to be a big disappointment because it lost a lot of resilence just in a week and when I sit on it, it presses all the way to the bottom of the chair and isn't very supportive... wish I had ordered the 4"" thick one....it being a medical cushion, I thought it would have been better...just have to keep searching for one that doesn't go limp."
105388,0,"I was shocked to see how small the bottle was. And it was $9.99, I couldn't believe how expensive it is. But neverthless I loved the taste of it. And even more strange thing is I was having trouble sleeping, and after I had it over the night, I slept 8 hrs. I don't know if that's real but I personally slept really good after drinking it. Maybe it brought time back to my childhood days of no worries and high hopes when the world looked so great. Overall it's a nice drink which is healthy and a replacement drink for chocolate drink once in a while. Great product but yeah over priced."
402279,0,"I enjoyed using this product but my grand child was a bit cautious about it. He liked the sound and did finally get into the tub, but it really wasn't his thing. I liked the portability of the tub and got the air out of it fairly easily when I wanted to deflate it. My husband could have blown it up more but it certainly does the job. It keeps the child ""padded"" and safe. It was a bit pricey and I wish it would have been cheaper..but need overruled cost."

I ordered this product (not through Amazon) about two months ago and I have to say that it really works. It's helped me to regain strength and independence in my middle and ring fingers and has also eliminated the numbness, tingling and pain that I worried was the start of carpal tunnel syndrome. The down side of this product is that the rubber bands supplied with it are very flimsy and both of mine snapped at the thumb within six weeks of my purchasing this item. I haven't yet contacted the manufacturer, so I can't say anything yet about the quality of their customer service, but in the meantime I'm improvising with a set of flat rubber bands that are considerably more comfortable and durable than the ones provided."

223705,0,"This BP monitor is very easy to use and provides consistent readings after repeated measurements. The memory retains BP measurements between battery changes but not the time/date. That's minor. The plastic case is nice and compact but put a scratch on the BP monitor.My biggest gripe is that this has the worst, cheapest battery cover I've seen on a product. Virtually touching it makes it fall off. Pushing the Memory 1 button on front makes it fall off. I'm not sure. But I think if you just look at it, the photons bouncing on it and then to your eyes will make it fall off.If you want accuracy and don't mind taping your battery cover on with duct tape or electrical tape, then it's a good purchase."
158797,0,"The toothbrushes themselves seem to do the trick, so no complaints there.I like the fact they have replaceable batteries, but the heads aren't (which is like the sonicare, except you can buy heads but not replace the battery). No one seems to be interested in making a toothbrush where you can make the hardware itself last. Such a shame.I was disappointed to get two of the same color. Not a great thing when you have two kids. I slapped a sticker on one to distinguish it from the other. Even if I was getting a 2-pack for one kid, just having two separate colors wouldn't hurt."

I'll just have to live with my old ones until I'm properly covered again in the future.I'm now trying to decide what to do with these new ones...I guess throwing them away is my only option. Oh well."
98318,0,"This is one of three different brands and/or models of rotary toothbrushes I have recently purchased. ( Three kids = three different toothbrushes!) Reasons to like this one are that it is very portable, the cool blue color makes it easy to tell from other toothbrushes that may be in your bathroom, and it is fun. (Anything that encourages toothbrushing and is effective can't be bad, can it?) On the downside, I am having difficulty locating replacement heads for this brush. Supposedly, replacements are available, but where to find them is a very important question to ask yourself before you purchase the toothbrush."
246433,0,"Electrasol Gelpacs are easy to use. Just put one in the dishwasher and turn it on, and the dishes get clean without any residue. No measuring or pouring required. My only gripe is that occasionally, a couple of gelpacs stick together in the box. When I pull them apart, one of them inevitably bursts. It's a mess and I lose one pack. I had a couple of those issues from my last box. For that reason, I prefer the individually packed dishwasher detergent cubes."

Each haircut was super bad, so the instruction guild was not fool proof. What I learned was cutting hair is a lot harder than it looks. I think I will give up and take him to a barber."

I never experienced it making me sleepy before, but after taking it as recommended, I was useless, unable to stay awake.I will try it again, but I was disappointed by this effect."
238909,2,"This product has two huge issues in my opinion...1) The shave: It doesn't nearly get close enough and you never have an actual clean shaven look. Also you have to go over the same place again and again to get it to shave off the hair properly.2) The battery: Sure it can last a week, but really the only good shave you'll get is if it's literally be 10 seconds off the charger. To make matters worse you can't leave it plugged in and shave.This product main redeeming aspect is that it has an excellent trimmer for thick beards and and sideburns.Overall I am pretty disappointed with it."
129254,0,"Just as we suspected, the first time we stuck the yard butler in our clay soil, the only hole at the base of the shaft, plugged solid. With a quick trip to our vice and drill, by drilling two holes a few inches up the shaft, it now works as it should."

251397,2,"Alli was off the market for a while and is now back on the market. DO NOT PURCHASE IT. I used it for years and it was wonderful & worked great. Now it is being made by a different manufacturer and it DOES NOT WORK. I have wasted money thinking it was a bad batch, but it wasn't. After researching on the Alli website, everyone agrees that it no longer works as before. You do not see it working as before. I am so angry that Alli does not do something about this and warn everyone it IS NOT THE SAME! CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED, DO NOT PURCHASE! I am hoping they will go public and revert back to the original maker. Until then, they just lost a dedicated customer."
100208,0,"These are definitely a clipper that you get what you pay for. Not the best available, but I would say they're not the worst either. I would bump the rating up a half star for the haircuts it has already provided saving me about $20 a pop. The product seems to be holding up okay, and the cuts hair okay. Just okay."
371496,0,I did not have any problems with leaking or puddling of water. This unit held its charge during the whole time I mopped my large kitchen floor. I agree with the previous reviewer who thought that the bristles should be lowered just a bit. It did take quite a few passes to clean up foot tracks etc. Overall the mop worked fine. Not sure if i will be keeping this yet. I do think it is faster to get out the old fashioned mop.
269033,0,"The mask and materials seem just fine, the only reason I docked it stars because its too big. The circumference of my head is ~22"" and I cannot tighten this enough to stay one for an entire nights sleep."
84046,1,"This product works as advertised and is very simple to use. The slot that holds the pill is made of a material that holds the pill tight, which allows you to place the pill and get a good cut everytime. The safety guard is a simple thick rubbery piece of plastic that slides in front of the blade. It's simple, but is effective. Just about anyone can use this device without trouble.The hinge is made of nothing but plastic and after some use it has started to squeak. The design makes me think this product may not last more than a couple of years, but that is just my initial impression after 2-3 months. With that said, I'm very happy with the product and recommend it over just about any pill splitter on the market hands down!"
265859,0,"I liked these strips a lot and did just buy them again. You get a lot for a good price, and 95% of the time the results are completely accurate. Most people who buy these are probably trying to get pregnant, and to see evaporation lines and get a bit excited is heartbreaking when you go to test the next day expecting a positive and see a definite negative. It only happened twice, but just happened to be twice in one day. Anyway, I will continue to use these but will take a faint positive with a grain of salt as it may be an evaporation line."
183243,0,The collars work great to keep the wax from entering the gap between the can and the warmer.You can make this yourself to save money. It's just a cardboard with a cut out of the can.

So it lasted about 1 year and eight months or so and that was just with normal use with one person using it 3 times a day. I wish it had lasted a lot longer, it was nice while it lasted."
112470,0,"When my wife bought this and told me the refills were $2 or $3, I knew we weren't going to continue using it, as that's highway robbery. The plastic bottle probably costs more than the contents.But I like the sprayer device, as it pretty thoroughly covers our shower. So I figured out how to refill the bottle with my own concoction. Other recipes would probably work as well. We started with a clean shower and the main use of the device is to add a surfactant to let the water flow off the tile better to reduce spots from our hard water. We also live in a dry area, so mildew isn't a problem.The recipe is as follows. I make it up in a 4 cup Pyrex measuring container. Mix 1 tablespoon of glycerine, 6 oz of isopropyl alcohol, then the remainder is distilled water to make 32 oz. Add in two or three drops of dishwashing soap.You can take the cap off the bottle with a pair of pliers. Then file or grind off the projections on the bottle that are intended to keep the cap on. Throw away the old gasket and make a new one with a 1 inch OD and about a 0.235 inch ID. I had a 1"" punch, but I had to make a small punch for the ID -- I turned a short piece of aluminum on the lathe to 0.240"" diameter and drilled the ID to 0.201"". Most of you won't have these punches, but I'll bet some work with scissors and razor blades will make something that works as well. I made the gasket from an old piece of inner tube, which was about 1/16"" thick.The bottom line is that our shower tile stays shiny (there will always be a few spots) and we haven't had to mess with much cleaning.The reason I rated the product 3 stars is that I feel they way overcharge for the refills. But the sprayer device works well and is certainly easy to use."
49449,2,the company has tried to get me to change my review of their product. did not appreciate that at all. the item was late in arriving though they try to tell me i am wrong. there is not enough padding in the product to make it comfortable to wear for over an hour but does provide relief and i appreciate that. no review of mine should ever come into question as i am not negative or positive but want to be objective for the benefit of others.

205902,0,I didn't feel a difference but maybe long term use of more than 1 bottle may lead to better results?
275571,0,"I've owned this razor for about two years now and while it does give me a relatively close and comfortable shave the battery life is starting to show its limited use. I would charge it for about eight hours and the charge usually lasts for about one shave. I don't even have that heavy a beard, and a shaving session lasts for about three-four minutes. I'm guessing that the battery should last longer than two years, but maybe that is normal, I don't know. I will admit that the blades have stayed sharp, but as I've mentioned, I don't have a heavy beard which would entail more wear on the cutting blades. I would like to replace the battery but do not know if replacement batteries are even possible. It would be a shame to replace the entire razor after two or three years but if this is the norm for Philips/Norelco razors then I will have to consider other brands."
352368,0,"I've been a ""Huggies Mom"" for the last decade, but now that I'm expecting my 4th (and last) child, I've been taking a look-back at diapers for both my 2 year-old son and my soon-to-be-born son. When Mars was born, this Huggies Mom was gifted with Swaddlers, and I liked the entire premise of them: They had very flexible tabs, an interesting looking clothish mesh liner (reminiscent of Always maxis --- that should have been my first clue), and seemed to fit him well. They also seemed to handle ""blowouts"" as well as if not better than Huggies. Unfortunately, that mesh liner gave his tiny butt a rash like I'd never seen on my other children (they'd been Huggies kids from the start). Switched back to Huggies, and voila. Rash gone.Fast-forward to now: I ran out of my fabulous Costco Kirkland diapers and haven't been able to get to the nearest town with a Costco to replenish the supply, so I decided to buy through Amazon (cheaper than at my local Albertson's, which is the only option here in my town). The price for both Huggies Supreme and Pampers Cruisers was decent; I bought the Huggies based on experience, but also a box of Pampers Cruisers based on the ratings here and the statements of how great they were for boys.Suffice it to say, my son's review immediately: ""It's too tight!""The Cruisers have that neat flexible tab, however, they must run smaller than Huggies or something because I couldn't wrap the tab around my son's hips like I usually did; he'd complain that the diaper was on too tight. So I'd loosen them until he said, ""That's better.""His next review: ""My belly hurts! It hurts my belly!""I checked to see what he was referring to: The hard and rather sharp wrap tabs of the Cruisers would poke him in the belly when he sat up or bent at the waist unless I'd placed them ""Just So"" each time precisely on the diaper. I'm used to Huggies' tabs: They're soft with rounded edges, and it doesn't matter where you put them on the diaper to close.But the review that cinched that I wouldn't be buying Cruisers for my eldest boy again: ""My butt hurts!"" or what every parent likes to hear: ""My penis hurts!""The mesh lining gave him that rash *again*. I'd thought that since he was older now, that his skin might be less sensitive to whatever was in the Swaddlers that gave him the red spotted rash. I was mistaken. His butt and perineal area and sometimes even on his scrotum and penis glans would frequently have red areas, no matter how often I changed him. (Thank god for Baby Aquaphor!) I'd never had that problem with Huggies or Kirkland for that matter.I did buy a small package Newborn Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive in addition to my usual Huggies Supreme for when my second son is born, based on the rave reviews it received. Every child is different, and who knows, they might work for this one. But if that rash comes back even once, that will be *it* for me and Pampers."

Measures taken fairly close in time can vary on this machine from being very ""normal"" to abnormally high within a time span from 10 to 30 minutes. The bells and whistles on this model are very nice in theory. However, if you cannot trust the measurements, it is all for naught."

It's frustrating that they would take off the market the only trimmer that worked great for both nose and ear hair, but since I know how good one of these can be, I know this one isn't as good as it can be.

I found that there was a piece of wood jammed into the tip which prevented water from flowing at all. It was easy to dislodge with a small tool, and put the hose on the bottom and flushed the wood out the hose connection.The tool does put water into the ground. I would absolutely agree with a couple of the suggestions on other reviews. You will be best served to drill a couple of holes into the side of the shaft. This will reduce the pressure of the water coming out, but that water was not able to dig any holes in my yard. To be fair, I have pretty rocky soil, so maybe it would work with a better soil. I went by Lowe's and picked up a piece of reinforcing iron (rebar would work fine), and hammered that bar into the ground to make the hole. When I put the root irrigator into that hole the water flows."

In addition, I followed the instructions and lost 11 pounds in one week! I never felt hungry and wasn't irritable like I was with other diet options I've tried.

229263,0,"I purchased this pillow as a replacement for my old Chiroflow water pillow. The Chiroflow worked very well, but it was a pain to maintain. It served me well, for several years, until it sprung a leak. I initially planned to purchase another Chiroflow, but changed my mind based on the reviews. Had the quality gone down since I purchased mine? I decided to try the Tri-Core pillow instead based on the positive reviews and the fact that it required much less care than a water pillow.The Tri-Core pillow is very well constructed. It didn't require a huge effort to put in a pillow case, like many specialty pillows. And it really does help relieve the pain in my neck. I just find it difficult to sleep on. It's like laying my head on a semi-comfortable brick. The pillow is extremely firm and has no ""give"". Should I have ordered the ""Gentle"" version? How many many men do you know that would order a ""Gentle"" anything for themselves? (My wife bought me the water pillow, just in case you were wondering.) I might order a ""Medium Soft"" pillow, but I don't know about a ""Gentle"" pillow. My point is, I most likely would have purchased a different pillow and be more satisfied if the seller used more common terms like ""Very Firm"". Whatever... I use it occasionally, when my neck is extremely sore, but not every night. At least until I find something more comfortable."

218891,0,"I bought this product after reading some reviews on detox foot pads and the positive results people have had with them. This is what happened.... When I opened the package, I noticed a distinct odor from the product. Not too pleasant to my senses, but tolerable. I placed the pads on my feet as directed on the package insert (3 patches to cover the top, middle, and bottom of each foot - which is different from how it is shown on the box) and crawled into bed. Almost immediately, I noticed a very ""stinky"" smell every time a moved around in the sheets. The smell was coming from my feet!!!! Needless to say, it was hard getting a good night's rest because the smell seemed to get worse as the night went on. The next morning, I could hardly stand the smell of my feet. I pulled off the pads and GROSS!!! There was this nasty brown goop on the pads. So the pads did ""something."" I jumped in the shower but no matter how hard I scrubbed my feet, I could not get rid of the smell! I tried to neutralize the odor by spraying mint foot spray on my feet but it didn't help. And right now, the smell is still not going away! It has been 8 1/2 hours since I scrubbed my feet and I can still smell the nastiness while I type this!!! (and no, I am not holding my feet underneath my nose) So, even if the product works, I cannot use it because of how it interacts with my ""foot chemistry."" Shooo-eeee!!!! (I don't think my body is that ""polluted"" but who knows...) In the meantime, I am off to look for a ideas on how to get rid of this horrible smell."

257854,0,I had a older (had it for maybe 5 years) version of this trimmer that finally came apart in my hands (literally) and had to replace. The first thing I noticed is that this thing is NOISY whereas the older one was fairly quiet. I also don't think the build quality is very good...I don't expect this one to last very long. I prefer these types of trimmers because they tend to give a closer trim than the rotary type. It's a good thing that they are fairly cheap.

To be honest, living like this SUCKS. I tried DGL, Mastic Gum for more than a month; unfortunately those did not work for me. I searched many natural products ( since I REALLY don't want to take any Proton/Prilosec products) and came across with Heartburn Free product. When I first took it last week ( every other day), I thought it was a MIRACLE that God sent. I truly thought this was it. I felt great. I told everyone that I felt GREAT. Well, I guess I spoke too soon! Since two days my hearburn/acid reflux attacks have come back and I had to use Prilosec. One of the reviewers/users mentioned as a TIP that continue using acid reducer pills. I think she might be right. Since two days I thought this product has not been working for me.

I mix with milk to gain the extra protein from fat-free milk. This stuff has an aftertaste that is pretty awful. I still have it because I mixed with just enough fat-free, sugar-free chocolate syrup to cut that aftertaste and make it somewhat palatable. I am also averse to wasting $30 if I can help it, and thank goodness for FF, SF syrups! Just be warned that, if you only mix with water, the aftertaste may be more than you can bear."
46618,0,"The Poise pads themselves were fine, but seemed a little old - the packaging did not match packages I had previously purchased at the store.

421610,0,"First I want to say that I think that products that are recycled or environmentally safe deserve a five star review no matter what. I do have issue with the way seventh generation sends out its products. I recieved a 30 pack of paper towels that looked as if it had been used as a tackling dummy. Now, having said that, they are just towels and I don't really care no damage done. On reading other reviews I have noticed that others report the same condition for some of thier packaging as well. As I said before, with towels no big deal, liquid soaps and detergents are another matter. If we're trying to globally cut down on waste then either better packaging or a more gental carrier service is needed since if you get a case of six bottles of detergent and two or three are crushed or have a hole in them stuff is obviously wasted and yet another replacement package needs to go out that may suffer the same fate. I realize that to keep costs down this shipping is what it is, but with so many people now seeing the advantages of going ""Green"" shouldn't consideration now be thrown into safe delivery of our eco friendly products? Maybe I'm just whistling in the wind but at some point there has to be a better way!"
127108,0,"The mask is comfortable and true to the product description your eyes don't feel a thing. It also has a velcro in the back of the strap which must be so that it can separate without choking you, because the velcro is too small for size adjustments.My major quibble with the mask is that it leaks in a lot of light around the nose area because of the contours. There is undoubtedly someone out there that this mask would fit and it would be a fantastic product for that single person. Unfortunately, that person is not me, nor is it my girlfriend."
171543,0,"This moisturizer is more fluid than I thought it would be. If you squeeze out too much at a time, it can get away from you. However, it did well at not getting sticky and not drying up too quickly."
325959,0,If evaluated for what it is - an energy bar - this measures up to my expectations. I carry this in my bag for emergency energy when I'm traveling or otherwise unable to get regular food. The flavor and texture are very satisfying and it doesn't leave a metallic aftertaste as some bars do. The texture is not too dense or overly crunchy - just the right balance.

343799,0,"I had never used a waterpik before, but my dentist recommended one to me. The first time I used it I was surprised for two reasons. The first was how loud it was! The second was that I had never had a home cleaning that was so good. It was so great I didn't mind the fact that I needed ear plugs when it was turned on. Okay it's not quite that loud.Here are the things I didn't like. When gripping the nozzle I found myself accidentally disconnecting it because my fingers were too high. If I lowered my grip I would accidentally lower the pressure. Both things were easy enough to get around, but annoying.Then two days later it would only work at a low pressure which was both dissapointing as well as useless. Two days! Not that I was too surprised. When the motor is on it seems to pump violently.Well, I bought the WP-100. I've used it once, and love it so far. It's quiet, and the nozzle is easier to use.Pay the extra few bucks and get the WP-100."

It sucks because cinnamon clove was my favorite flavor. I have REALLY sensitive skin. I had cracks on the sides of my mouth for about a week even after discontinuing the use of the toothpaste."
232272,0,"The true test of a trimmer such as this is how well it holds up over the long haul, and it's difficult for me to assess that after having owned it for only a month or so. The one complaint I have at this point is that the light feature (which isn't all that important for overall performance) is angled improperly and is therefore of no use whatsoever."
110772,0,"I'm pretty blind (-10.5 in right, -7.5 in left). I had noticed that my prescription was weak, i.e. my glasses weren't as clear. So I ordered these glasses, not looking for a miracle, but to improve my prescription a bit and reverse the downhill trend my eyes have.I wore it for 15 minutes a day, which did nothing for me, so put them away for a month. And then one day I was watching a movie on my computer, put the glasses on for a few hours. The next day I woke up, it was like a miracle. My eyes felt physically different, they felt relaxed and better. The only way I can describe it is if you've ever spent a long time reading a book or playing a computer game, then go to bed, and then your eyes feel tired and fuzzy the next morning? Well, this was like that, but in reverse, my eyes felt relaxed and better.And then I put on my contact lenses and bam!, they were really really clear. Amazingly clear. I could see things I hadn't seen before. So I wore the glasses about 1 hour each night watching TV online, and it seemed to get better. I was thrilled.Fastforward about 1 week later, I still continued to put the glasses on for about 1 hour per day, and I'm not sure if I did something wrong (too much TV watching?), but overnight my eyes have returned to their blurry state. I'm still wearing the glasses, and will see if I make improvements (perhaps 2 steps forward, 1 step back?), but I'm also going to read books on improving natural vision etc. My conclusion is that the changes do happen, but they may not be permanent."

326821,0,"Strengths: It is Braun, and normally that means it lasts and lasts.Weaknesses: After 5 months of daily use it performed so well but the switch on ALL Braun Flx shavers was changed post 5550Summary: I owned the 5550, and I had it for years. I loved it. I have sensitive skin, and razors, no matter how much I spend on them will chew up my skin, especially around the neck area. My first was a 5550. It worked great for years and alas it died. That is when I very carefully picked my Braun 7526. I considered the cost of solutions. I manage it by only giving it a good cleaning once a week which reduces evaporation. When done shaving M-Sat I remove the foil, remove most of the rubble by tapping it in the sing and replace it. Charge lasts entire week without another charge. I then shave Sunday, and do a clean and charge. Worked great, and I liked the idea of saving on the solution. However a net effect I did not count on was the winter, when it is ""cold"" season. When I would get a cold, I realized that you can not do under your nose without getting cold bacteria on the foil. So when I have a cold, I clean it every time to avoid re-infecting myself.However, after 6 months of daily use, the cheap plastic switch mechanism jammed and it stayed on until it died. They repaired it and 2 weeks I had it back. Since then I have been using it daily for months with no issues.I do notice that my 5550 did give me a closer shave, faster however. But the 5550 was made in Germany, and I don't believe this unit is made in Germany. Perhaps part of it is, but this is not German engineering at all.The solution can get to be rather annoying to replace, but what I have found works well is I use the shaver daily, and simply open the screenhead, tap out most of the razor stubble, then stick it back in the cabinet. Come the weekend, I drop it in to the base and do a full clean and charge. This will extend the life of your cleaning solution as it does evaporate on it's own, more so if you were to clean it daily, which of course they suggest.Overall, this is a decent product. If it broke tomorrow, I would replaceit..."

371822,0,"Overall advice: don't buy a large quantity of any nursing pad until you find one you really like.Specific advice: If you started your pregancy with large breasts (DD and up before baby) I believe that you might prefer the supermarket-available GERBER brand pads to these. The curvature of the Lansinoh pads presumes a medium or large (but not huge) breast. This made the pads more noticeable under clothing. These pads are very absorbent, and do effectively prevent leakage."

How could I possibly use this much in 30 days? The product does work okay but the 30 day shelf life is a real deal buster for future purchases. If it was 30 days for a single application that would be different. I have two bottles and will only open the new bottle when I really have to. I will have to find another product that once opened will last years.

The moist towlettes used to clean wounds eventually dry up and also can't be replaced. It would appear J&J would prefer you buy a new kit, even though the other items are perfectly good. Yes the items are sold separently in bigger sizes at stores and online, but they may not fit well in the kit. Besides, by the time you pay for all of them , it may pay to buy a new kit.

I'm actually now toying w/ the notion of selling these along w/ the promate blades, and anivo bladesetter and getting another set of Detailers.

I expect medium to fit a waistline of between 30-36, but this was way too small, and should have been labeled small. At least the vendor should have provided a sizing table on the web site if their sizing is non-conventional. Luckily someone else was able to use this support. It's a hassle to return and reorder."
280642,0,"I've had this razor about 2 months now, so my face is pretty well adjusted to the switch from a blade shave (Gillette Fusion). I still can shave more of my face, especially the concave areas, slightly closer with blades than this electric, but it's close enough and faster.My only issue is charge retention. The razor gave me about 20 shaves after the initial charge, but after the 2nd I got about 5 before it was drained - an annoying surprise on a business trip. I hand't used it for about a week following the full recharge, but I would have expected it to retain energy when not in use. I'm reviewing th owner's manual to see if it's me."

116881,2,"This instrument was suggested to me by my internist. At his BP clinic, his medical assistants told me the systolic BP's measured by my OSZ5 were inaccurate. I called WA's service and was told this model couldn't be calibrated. They offered an exchange at no charge which I accepted. A few months later, the instrument fell 18 inches from my bed and landed on the floor. The battery compartment popped open and two small plastic pins broke off so the compartment would no longer stay closed. I sent it back to WA for repairs. They told me the instrument needed recalibration (I had been previously told that was impossible.) along with the repair. They quoted a charge of $75 plus shipping. Since I had paid around $110 for the unit, this seemed rather expensive.This took place while the instrument was under warranty. They said this repair was not covered. I told them to junk it."
121231,0,"I have had the original Sonicare for years and it finally gve out. I started looking and found they make many different models (don't know why they can't just leave a good product alone).The idea with the Sonicare is that you divide your mount into 4 quadrants and brush each section for 30 seconds. My original model ran for 2 minutes, with a beep every 30 secondes so that you knew when to move to the next section. This new model has the 2 minute timer, but there are no beeps. No indiction of the 30 second marks.What you want is the Sonicare with the Quadpacer function. That gives you the 30 second beeps that were in the original unit."
11133,0,"First of all, when I received this a few months ago, the tweezers wouldn't touch because the rubberized grippers were too thick. After I slid a nail file between the grippers a few times, the tweezers worked fine (if you do this, be careful not to file too much, as you don't want the metal visible). I was a little worried that the machine would make beeps or other loud noises (I have a dog who becomes obsessed with noises) but it's quiet and doesn't make any beeping noises (the only real noise is the sound of the foot pedal which I use on the table in front of me and push down with my other hand). As for the actual electrolysis part of it, it seems to work. They recommend you read the instructions carefully before using it and I feel this is a must! Before I got the machine I figured I could hold a hair with tweezers for a minute or longer, no problem. However, after using the machine, I've realized that you have to grab the hair very close to the skin (and oftentimes I end up electrocuting my skin because of this, even though that is not recommended) and you have to use a special conduction gel (included, though I added some saline solution to it to make it more liquid) in order to actually get the electricity to enter into the hair follicle. You need a very steady hand and it seems that, if you don't feel any kind of sensation, you probably are not holding the hair in the correct place. However, you can also get too much sensation and end up burning / blistering your skin. This machine is apparently also used by professionals and can be used with the electrolysis needles (though it says you have to have a license in order to use it with the needles - which are not included). And after using the machine, I now understand why electrolysis is expensive and time consuming. Your hand easily gets cramped after holding the tweezers for some time, so I've resorted to paying my niece who's in her teens to come and do it on me. =) Also, beware of the plugs for the tweezers and patch cords become loose... If left that way, I think they'd lose their current but I applied gorilla glue around them and that has helped keep them in place.I probably wouldn't really recommend this to a friend, just because I don't think most of my friends would really commit to using it, so it would be a waste of their money. If I were to do it again, I'd probably try one of those laser hair removal machines that you can also buy online (but for two to three times the price) because I would like to try them to see if they work any better / easier. If you do get this, it seems to be easiest to use it at a table or desk. I had been thinking I could maybe do it while watch TV but that is practically impossible for me to do. All in all, it works but takes tons of time and lots of effort and you only really get it through trial and error. If you have the money, go for it. If you can't really afford it, I'd probably just stick to waxing and individual tweezing. =) Keep in mind that the laser hair removal things seem to have gotten better reviews than this though. =)"

143176,0,"I was so excited to receive this product. My first impression of the stethoscope was that it was a bit heavy. It doesn't bother me though. The acoustics are excellent. I tried my mothers, my grandmothers, and even my dog's lung/heart sounds and they were as clear as day. However, after a few minutes I realized that the tubing was a MESS! They rub against each other and you can barely appreciate the clarity of the acoustics because of the rubbing. Also, the left tube slid off the head as if nothing. I was disappointed because if this happened while being home and only trying it one two people, imagine taking this thing to clinicals. How embarrassing for it to do something like that with a patient.Next, I tried the cuff. It looks alright, though I had trouble with the bladder and gauge. It was SO hard to use that little gauge. It just doesn't seem very great. But it still does its job.The penlight is reallllly nice. I really loved it.It also comes with measuring tape and bandage scissors, which is really nice and important for clinicals.The fanny pack is pretty cute and handy. Anyways, its a nice product but the stethoscope is rinky dink. I think I am going to return the product just because of that. Otherwise, its all awesome. Even the earbuds weren't a problem to me. Maybe its because I had big ears(?)."

Once da-307 battery dies I will need to replace the entire unit even though the rest of the mechanics work fine. This is not an environmentally conscious design. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the da-307.Edit: I ended up returning the unit. I did not like the fact that it would not work corded. I purchased a Remington F720 instead."

398931,0,"I've used whatever was the current top-of-the-line Norelco for years, but after reading the reviews of this razor decided to give it a try. I noticed that most of the other reviewers don't mention if they use this razor wet or dry. I used it dry. Here are my findings:PROS* Very smooth shave on the cheeks, much smoother than the Norelco in that area* Cleaning is easy* It is relatively quiet* I haven't cut myself or gotten razor burn as I have with other foil shaversCONS* Only cuts hairs when the razor perpendicular to the direction of hair growth. That means unless you've trained all of your facial hair to grow in neat rows pointing in the same direction you have to make multiple passes from many directions to get the hairs to cut. It is sometimes necessary to make a pass to cut one hair because it happens to grow at a different angle from the others. This is both tedious and uncomfortable given the contortions needed to get the razor going in some directions. The multiple passes mean it takes about twice as long to shave.* You must wear your glasses and work in front of a non-fogged mirror. I could shave with the Norelco by feel, just move it over the face for a while and do a quick check at the end in front of a mirror to see if I missed anything. This razor requires real concentration and good eyesight to make sure you are coming at the hairs in right direction and getting them all. Areas like under the nose, the Adams Apple, and around the jaw line require close attention because of the many growth directions. Pay attention or your Singificant Other will make comments about your looking scruffy, which doesn't sit too well after you've paid $160 for a new razor.* The trimmer is just plain stupidly placed and so easily accidently activated that you will find yourself with an exposed running trimmer several times during each shave. The only solution seems to be to hold the razor at the base, which is uncomfortable, reduces control, and impairs your ability to shave in the odd directions needed to get the hairs to cut. This never happens with the Norelco, and Panasonic should buy one of them and study how to do it right.* Battery life is horrible. Given how long it takes to shave each time, you have to charge this razor more than once a week. That means for travel you must bring the charger with you. It is a compact charge stand, but still bulkier than a simple cord.ConclusionI bought this because I thoguht there had to be a better shave available than what the Norelco could do. However, compared to the current top-of-the-line Norelco they are about the same, with obvious negatives that make neither a particularly good experience. Since I'm not going to get a great shave in either case, I might as well save the extra 5 - 7 minutes each morning and stick with Norelco. It is also considerably cheaper."

245688,0,"As a life-long Braun user, I've owned a Syncro for 2 years now. It has its good points, but I wouldn't buy it again, because of the high cost of upkeep.The Good: nice, close shave, recharges very quickly, handy self-cleaning system.The Bad: because of the much smaller cutting block, shaves take MUCH longer than with older Brauns (2-3 times as long.) Also the cleaning cycle is very noisy, and the cost of the cleaning cartridges at $5 a pop can add up quickly. I extend the cartridge life by a month or two by adding Isopropyl alcohol when the red light goes on.The Ugly: The cutting block is a small, cheap piece of plastic with tiny little pieces of metal foil embedded for blades , These buggers break off very easily, and often do so within the first couple of months of routine shaving, rendering the shaver ineffective, with shaves taking even longer than the usual 5-7 minutes.

I find it balanced, but i do not keep supplies in side pockets. I carry a seperate bag for supplies. I could see that causing a balance issue as the previous reviewer wrote. My biggest issue is the weight it has added when i need to lift table. You still need to carry table up few steps, and into trunk, so the wooden base where the wheels are is heavy. Plus the base has added 3-4 inches in height to the bag, so being 5'3"" these two things do make it more difficult. But I prefer to suffer with few steps and be able to wheel it down 100' hallways!

211502,1,"Every electric razor that I've ever bought or been given as a gift, has always been a Norelco rotary. I've never been able to get a really good shave with one of those, and always found myself turning to a blade. My blade of choice for the last number of years has been the Mach3.Recently, my boss was given a Braun 370 PocketGo travel shaver. I thought it was really cool, and always wanted to try a Braun foil shaver without spending a lot of money, so I bought one. It gave me about the same shave I got with the Norelco rotaries, but given that it is a battery operated single blade shaver, I was impressed, and wondered what a ""real"" Braun shaver would do. After doing a bit of research on the various models and reading the customer reviews (on this site), I decided on the 8975, due to the new foil, Gillette blade technology, power comb, and active head. I also do not have a convenient place to keep the Clean&Renew; system plugged in.Now for the good part... after receiving the shaver, I charged it for the recommended initial charge time of (at least) 4 hours, then test shaved with it. It was AMAZING! It was FAST and CLOSE! My face was as smooth as the proverbial ""baby's butt"", with no skin irritation (always a problem with the Norelcos for me) because the Gillette blade is so sharp, and the new foil system was so effective. I know most people won't believe me, but I'm going to say it anyway... I got a CLOSER SHAVE than with my Mach3! All electric shaver companies say to allow 2 to 3 weeks for your skin and beard to adjust to the new shaver, but I can't see how it can get any better than my test shave!I did however, use a pre-electric shave (a CVS generic version of William's 'Lectric Shave) and an after shave (which I never used to use), so these things may have affected how the shaver performed, and minimized any skin irritation. That said, it was still a FANTASTIC first shave, and I would not hestitate to recommend (already have) this shaver to anyone!"

Note that on each cell it actually says: ""typ.800mAh min.750mAh"", so this is still considered within spec. On the other hand, eneloop AAA cells are measured to be 830-840mAh, or nearly 10% higher than that of Sony cellsMy long-term self-discharge data, based on AA version of Sony Cycle Energy cells, showed that they only retained an average of 69% charge after 1 year. In contrast, the eneloop cells were tested to retain around 85% charge, just like advertised.As of this writing, the Sony Cycle Energy AAA cells are priced even higher than Sanyo eneloop cells. So although they are decent quality batteries, there is really no reason to pay more and settle for less.In additional to the Sanyo eneloop, here are some other low-cost alternatives with even higher capacities:-GP ReCyko+ AAA: rated 820mAh, measured ~880mAh-Tenergy Centura AAA: rated 800mAh, measured ~900mAh[Side Note:]There are two different wrappers for Sony Cycle Energy cells.

I can safely say that the pills do give you energy -- and not just caffeinated energy. I know they gave me the stamina I needed to make it through the evening and get things done. I was pleased to see that some of the energy boost did not come from caffeine, what many pills use. Granted, there is caffeine in these but there is also other ingredients that help generate energy as well.As far as definition, or adding muscle, I really didn't notice any. I do lift weights and try to walk 3-4 miles per day. However, besides giving me the energy to complete these tasks, I really couldn't notice much of anything else.So, overall, I rate them at around 75% for their stamina ability. A good alternative for those who don't want to be pumped up on caffeine alone."

As for its ability to stop snoring I'm not convinced. I think it should be marketed more aggresively for those with swollen turbinates. The general public does understand what turbinates are but the word never is mentioned in the company marketing literature. I am anxious to fall asleep with them in but I can't. I begin to sneeze from the irritation from the contact between the plastic and the flesh/hair inside my nose. It generates mucous and makes the plastic slippery which causes it to fall out. I also can't turn on my stomach without it falling out.The main set back is price. Because of the patent and trademarks on Nozovent (12.00 plus shipping!) and the Breath Right strips the proprieters have a license to exploit the public. Breathe Right and Nozovent design their products to wear out quickly to generate more profit. The prices never go down only up.

I just have uncontrollable urges to eat maple candies, buttertarts, and Nanaimo bars, and I didn't even know what buttertarts or Nanaimo bars were before they were all I could think about.

263397,2,I bought this product thinking it would be a decent protein. I was highly dissapointed. It has a very bad taste and unless you are using a blender (I use a blender bottle) it is very hard to get the protein to break down and not be chunky. Spend your money on gold standard or syntha 6. Just as good of proteins with a much better taste and blendabilty.

Krill oil has been a great aid to lowering my cholesterol, its tasteless to me and it goes down easy (and stays down, unlike fish oil for me). However, The shipments I receive from this supplier when I open them, they have a strong smell of fish. Its likely that in the shipping process over regular mail the heat is causing the pills to stench up. The local pharmacy has these exact same ones, without any smell! I asked the pharmacist and he agreed that its likely the heat is affecting these pills. overall great price, great product, just cant stand the smell of heated krill oil!"

368217,2,"This product just really does not do the job. It is painless because it doesn't actually pull any hairs. It seems to be a quality build, but the motor is not as strong as a model that works directly as a corded model. Most of all, the tweezing mechanism does not grab hairs of any length or thickness as far as I can tell. I had to return it.I had previously owned a Philips Satinelle Ice which worked quite well overall. However, I will say it was not durable. Somewhat cheaply made. Still, I found that with heavy use and at a price of approx $55 it was still a good deal if I had to replace it every 6 or 9 months. Apparently that product is now discontinued. Not sure what to try next. The tweezing method of the ceramic disks in this product is definitely the best design I've seen in action so far."

A bottle this size if used every day will last you about 3 years.Aftershave:1 starJust not something I'll be using again. First use broke my neck out severely within minutes.

Then after only 2 months of use, the tub began to leak. We followed the directions but it still continued to leak like crazy. Now we are having to search for another bathtub for our son that he will fit into comfortably. The size of this particular tub worked very well for us. It fits nicely on the countertop. The suction cups are a bit hard to loosen from the counter, but if you use the tabs on the suction cups, it comes up fairly easily."

Near as I can tell, they seem to do a solid job in Wii controllers and TV remotes. If the price is right, I'd say grab 'em."

Maybe down the road I will get the more deluxe versions, but the Braun SmartControl3 4775, being cordless is very sweet !"
192325,0,This product is overpriced in my opinion. For what it does - crest whitening can do the same. Nothing to write home about or tell your friends to run out and buy. Just another ploy to get you to spend a lot of $ on little product. Most whitening toothpastes in stores do just-as-good-a job if not better. Save your $ and head to the grocery store.

393404,0,"The sling is genius, the bath itself can last from newborn to early toddler, but the non slip pads fell off before my baby was even out of the sling. And the most annoying part was cleaning it. You can't tell from the picture but there are 4 tiny, but deep crevices in the corners of the hard plastic tub that are impossible to scrub if you want to give this tub a good cleaning. I would try to shove a cloth with cleaner down them like the neck of a water bottle, but I still don't feel it got clean. The plastic tub design could easily have been made simpler to avoid this."
384100,2,The opening in the rubber seal in the plastic seal ring is too small to accomodate an adult's cast. I couldn't get my hand and cast into the waterproof cover. Maybe the device would work for smaller hands. My hand and cast aren't unusually big.

77244,0,"This sound conditioner came with glowing reviews on Amazon, so I may have expected too much. This system is essentially a small fan, with a limited variable speed setting, but it's not more than open holes (pictured) with sliding closures, and is somewhat disruptive (a humidifier, for example, would serve a similar purpose). It is good in canceling out potentially distracting sounds, but I can't honestly say it's better than relative silence. It's fairly priced, and is compactly designed, but I was hoping for greater variation in tone and speed. For me, it does not drop to a level that creates a more soothing tone, so I'm considering not using it at all. Also, though slight, this unit may be less effective in the winter, when the fan may decrease actual room temperature slightly."
270941,0,The service was very good and the price BUT I taste the orange for a long time after I take it. That is a disappointment.
284177,1,Product is as expected. The shaft of the stand could be about 1/2 inch taller to accomdate larger brushes easily. Just right for my basic brush.
273383,0,"These are high quality, very beautiful glasses. BUT I was specifically looking for bigger, which is what I think of when I think fo Clark Kent, not just the shape. I believe the measurements said they were 2&#34; x 2&#34;, which they definitely are not. So, if you are looking for a beautiful pair of glasses, normal size, these are definitely perfect. But, if you are looking for that new, oversize style, forget it."
423641,0,"With my hectic schedule of numerous appointments at changing time periods every day this watch is a life saver for me. It has four alarms which is more than most. You can turn the hour notification off and on and that is also helpful in keeping track of time. It keeps very accurate time. There are two things I do not like about the watch. The first is that it has somewhat large buttons on the side that have a tendency to get pulled off. At one time these large buttons were replaced with much smaller buttons that did not have the problem of being pulled off. However, it appears that the company has gone back to the large buttons again. The second thing that I do not like about the watch is that for one reason of another it only lasts about 6 to 12 months before it self-destructs. Sometimes the battery can be replaced and the life of the watch can be extended, but usually other electrical problems develop that terminate its ability to function. If you don't mind having a throw away watch that you have to replace at least once a year, then this is a good watch. I usually keep a reserve watch on hand because one can never tell how long it will be before the watch goes dead. If you take it to a watch repair shop to have the battery replaced it is not that much more expensive to just buy a new watch when you figure in $10.00 battery replacement, gas expense, and time involved in taking it somewhere and picking it up. Update. I am adding to my previous comments. I still use this watch daily. My last watch lasted 1.5 years. The current one lasted 2 months. It seems like this watch does not have much in the way of quality control in the China manufacturing plant. If I didn't need all 4 alarms so much I'd try and find another watch that was more reliable. As it is I'll buy a couple more and hope for the best."

214148,0,"This capsule maker works best when the air and weather is dry. It doesn't work well during rainy season/humid weather. I read through all the (mixed) reviews. Although every reviewer did not indicate the area of the country they live in, one thing became apparent: reviewers who live in arid or dry climates (e.g., Arizona, Texas, Nevada), are delighted with this gadget because they have no complaints about the capsules sticking or not coming out easily. In my case, I think the moisture in the air where I live (SF Bay Area) affects the gelatin capsules (which I keep with dessicant in a tightly closed glass jar), thereby resulting in capsules getting stuck in the capsule maker. I'll just have to fill my capsules during the summer, when the weather is dry and the air has very low, or no humidity."
290937,0,"I bought this to see if it would be able to remove the (small but noticeable to me) spots/stains on our older, white gas stovetop, but this product didn't do much of anything for it. My Mr. Clean Magic Erasers did a much better job at getting most of the staining, so I'm going to roll up my sleeves and show those few remaining spots no mercy...This Astonish cleaner is a finely gritted white paste and I can see how this would be suitable and effective for many things, but just wasn't (effective) for my primary purpose of the stove top. It does appear just a little of this will go a long way, which makes it a cost-effective product. I did test a small area on some (vintage) mustard-colored cookware, but quickly stopped as it appeared to be causing some surface damage (slightly removing the finish). I'm sure that I will find some other use for it at some point, such as stainless steel, oven interior, vehicle wheels/rims, etc. or something that can handle the grit texture."

163141,0,"I think it is a good quality product with few flaws. The firs thing I want to point out is that it isn't colored like it looks in the picture; it's just white. Not that this affects the quality or how well it worked. I just thought I was buying a pink cup. It's also quite large. I'm having a hard time getting it in, but I've read that that's normal. Overall, I like it."
391002,1,"I have a senior Miniature Poodle (weighs about 23 lbs.) and she's had problems with a luxating patella for years. I volunteer for an animal welfare organization and it was suggested to me that I put my pup on Glucosamine/Chondroitin. I shopped around a bit at one of the big brand pet supply stores and chose a store-brand senior vitamin that contained Gl/Ch primarily. Though they never seemed to help my girl all that much I probably spent $100 or so over the last year. Recently she has had more significant mobility problems, so I made a vet visit. He clarified to me that, as vitamins, GL/Ch isn't regulated or tested by the FDA. BUT there are groups that have tested viability of what's on the market. Best choices for product quality hale from Nutramax, whether the human version as Cosamin or the pet version as Cosequin. I chose to buy the human variety for my pup as she isn't picky (eats nearly everything in gulps) so the capsules weren't a problem for her. The dog variety is available in chewables. I highly recommend to talk to your vet about the dosage appropriate for your dog as after just 3 days my senior pup was able to jog and jump again!!! Amazon's price was the best I could find online or locally."
387439,0,The vitamins do not make me sick when I take them and they don't have iron.

109183,0,"Medline has changed the majority of the assembly parts on their Overbed Table but hasn't changed the assembly instructions. To be specific; the instruction sheet shows a Release Lever to be installed which you will not find in the parts bag, because you will eventually discover it as a permanent part of the table top. The Column Assembly no longer has a rectangular ""L"" base, but now has a flat plate. The instructions show a ""Top Bracket"" with bolt holes on the sides to hold the ""L"" base to the table top . Since there's no longer an ""L"" base, there's no longer a top bracket either. So except for the instructions to snap the wheel casters into the frame, the Medline instructions are almost completely wrong. The model numbers on the instruction sheet match the model number on the shipping box.The outdated assembly instructions are extremely unfortunate because Medline actually made assembly easier and probably made the table sturdier. But I think many purchasers may be under stress from either their own poor health or their loved ones and the last thing they need are confusing assembly instructions."

332313,1,"Dreft has been in my life since the 1940's. My mother kept a small box of Dreft powder under the kitchen sink for our daily dish washing routine and hand washing of woolen sweaters, mittens and hats. Nowadays, I use 1-2 tablespoons of powdered Dreft per load in my front load washing machine, and much less for a basin full of hand laundry or woolens, hand washing dishes and especially glassware, soaking pans with stubborn baked on food, washing windows, and general cleaning, including floors. A little bit goes a long way. Any glassware and window use, leaves them squeaky clean with clear evidence that it has completely rinsed away. I've made my husband a believer in that he has switched from the old vinegar and crumpled newspaper for window washing, to, ""Where's the Dreft?"" It gets things really clean without leaving behind an unwelcomed strong perfume smell or residue that might encourage itchy skin. It was after all, developed and is famous for laundering baby clothes. While I am unaware of its chemical formula, I trust that it is one of the purest cleaning products on the market. Lately, it has become increasingly difficult to purchase powdered Dreft locally, so here we are once again on Amazon, fulfilling our wishes and necessities lists."
292836,0,"A few years ago I had a Homedics Envirscape rock garden fountain. not illuminated, but solidly built.It finally got a little ratty with use, so I decided to buy a new one with a light this time. This new version is very cheaply made out of light weight plastic.. all of it. I was rather disappointed to say the least, but I decided to put it together and see how it worked. It takes a little patience to put it together. It's working ok. Having the setting on the highest level for the pump is the best. Anything lower is useless. There are less rocks than in the original, so the inside workings do show. I plan to put more of the old rocks in and around it to cover up the open spaces. It seems nothing is built very sturdy anymore. Hearing the water fall over the rocks and slats is peaceful. I needed that water flowing sound.We are in a severe drought."

If they lower the sodium to 3/4 that amount then I'll think about giving them another star.The taste of the protein is okay. If you use this for breakfast, be prepared to have the taste of eggs in your mouth while burping.Bottomline: TOO SALTY.UPDATE: It seems my stomach doesn't really agree with this protein.

Luckily I do not have to wheel this unit around and for now I am able manage with the height it has &#34;chosen&#34; to stay at. If I ever have the need for another pole like this, I would spring for a higher quality pole if I am able to determine what that is by the description."
398062,1,"This has to be the best antiperspirant-deodorant on the market. It has no smell of its own, causes absolutely NO irritation at all, and does both jobs really well. On occasions where I can't shower daily (camping), this stuff has actually lasted up to 4 days without failing the ""odor test."" Thanks Almay! And thanks Amazon for carrying it, it is difficult to find in stores."
422322,0,"It goes together easily and makes it easy to squeeze a tube of toothpaste, but the unit isn't large enough for a family size tube. You wind up with half the tube in the squeezer and no way to get more in. It would probably work fine with a smaller tube, but if the tube is smaller it's not so hard to squeeze it all out."
358258,0,"The oster fast feed is indeed a good clipper but isn't nearly worth the $60 it generally costs. If you're looking to give yourself a short buzz cut but not a skin tight one, you only have the blender guide comb as your only comb. The other 3 combs are way too large to be of any use. In terms of of quality of cutting, it's good considering that this clipper has a pivot motor. But this quality of cutting is certainly nothing out of the ordinary. Hence, for $60, you are indeed not getting your largest bang for your buck. Not when there are other solid pivot motor hair clippers around that go for around $30. One example would be the Andis speedmaster pivot motor hair clipper which is just as good but costs half the price!"

295994,2,"I have been using the Ovulite going on 5 months now. Not once has it shown me partial ferning or full ferning leading up to ovulation or during it. Even though I have had temperature shifts while BBT'ing, cervical mucus changes, and positive OPKs, and High/Peak readings on my Clearblue Easy Fertility monitor(high reading signifies estrogen surge, peak reading: LH surge). I have followed the directions very closely and still no ferning. Maybe I am just one of the few it doesn't work for, but it was certianly a waste of money for me."
378923,0,"I was given this tub as a gift and the tub does indeed leak like others have written, but the SLING is great! We have been just using the bath sling in our tub since our baby was able to tub bathe and now our 4 month old still loves it! It reclines just enough to keep his head out of the water and it doesn't take a lot of water to fill the tub. It made bath time easy. The bath sling needs to be sold seperately for that purpose. No baby bathtub needed if you have this. I didn't like other baby bathtubs because it seemed to be a hassle filling the tub and emptying it everytime you give a bath. With this you can just fill the tub and drain it at the end of the bath. Simple and easy. Worth buying the tub to get the sling!"
426829,0,"I was so looking forward to receiving this item since my heel has been hurting pretty badly for the past few months. First, the sizing is way too big so when it says 100-120 lbs, which I am, it's completely wrong. I couldn't get the one-size-fits-all since it's bulkier and I needed it to fit into my running shoes. But this sizing is deceptive, whoever goes by that guideline will not get anything that fits. It bunches up in my shoes and even the neoprene is loose. There's also a thick seam in the middle, right on top of the center of my foot, that when wearing it with my shoes, hurts the top of my foot because the shoe presses down on the seam, and I'm not even tying the shoes tightly.As to whether it works or not, I haven't noticed a difference. I ran with it on Tuesday and afterwards, my heel still hurt just as much as it did without it. It's only been a few days though so I'll give it a little more time. Just wish the sizing guide wasn't so off, it might help more if I had ones that fit better.UPDATE 10/21/12Okay, I upgraded my review to 3 stars after wearing it for about a month or so now. It does help to cushion my heels while I run, I also wear the heel cup on my right foot/heel everyday, even for regular walking. My heel still hurts after running but not as much as before. May work better if the fit was better but again the middle seam's just awful. If you don't have ankle problems and just your heel hurts, I would suggest just buying the heel cups that fit. They look simple but they seem to help a bit."

382864,0,"Wow...I didn't know natural cocoa butter was so solid. No wonder people prefer to buy the synthetic stuff. When I first got it, I would always have to microwave it every morning or dip it in hot water to melt it because it's so solid. I always hope it will stay liquid, but it goes back to its solid state by the next day! I got tired of heating it up so I barely use it anymore. Pros: smells excellent - smells kinda like chocolate! real chocolate. Yea...so does anyone know how to keep in in a liquid state?"
80244,0,The heads are not as good as what you get with the new shaver. Expensive for the quality that you get
278472,0,"Update: Now having gone through two bottles of these...they help, but not as effective as mental edge. I really wish Source Naturals would start making it again!!Update: I finished my first month and just got my second bottle. These STINK! I don't know what is different from the batch I first received, but these look a bit different from the last ones and boy do they smell. I would say the reviewer that said these stink described the smell about perfectly, I cannot do any better. I will still take them for now, but it almost makes me gag just the smell as I get these anywhere near my mouth if I forget to hold my breath.If they work (I'll give them a couple more weeks). I will still take them, but if you are sensitive to smells, you might want to look at something else. Hopefully they will start making MENTAL EDGE again!Original review:I used to take mental edge, but they have been out for so long, I got tired of waiting, I'm struggling with forgetfulness so I finally ordered these. I have only been taking for a few days so have not yet noticed any effect, I'm sure it will take a few weeks to really notice the benefit. I will come back on here to review again later.What I really wanted to comment on is the 1 star review on here. They don't stink that bad unless you literally stick your nose in the bottle to smell them, then yes, they smell nasty just like almost any vitamin does. But when you take a couple out and try to smell those, I really can't smell them. They do have a strong kind of bitter/sweet taste on the tongue, but I find it quite tolerable, almost pleasant actually.To sum up, the 1-star reviewer must have a very sensitive nose, don't let that review prevent you from ordering these, if they work anything like mental edge, they will work great, but I'll review the effectiveness in a few weeks."

69783,0,"I purchased this to replace a similar set that got lost in a move. I need a small broom and dustpan for quick clean-ups around the house, and since I have back problems, this design usually helps. I'm fairly tall (5'9""), and the dustpan's handle is OK for my height -- not perfect (it needs to be a bit longer), but OK.The dustpan part of this seems to be fine -- it hugs the floor tightly enough that I can get stuff into it with just a couple of sweeps.Which brings me to the broom. Whose bright idea was it to make this thing swivel up and down? It defeats the whole purpose of keeping the broom head secure against the floor. it takes at least twice as much work to do any real sweeping with this.I've given up, and now use another broom with this dustpan, and that's working much better."

30532,2,"I purchased this deodorant for my husband who has developed chemical sensitivities to a number of products due to mercury/heavy metal toxicity caused by the ""silver"" aka mercury fillings in his teeth. The packaging and label fooled me into believing it was a good, natural product. When my husband developed a bad reaction to the deodorant, I inspected the label and the list of ingredients. The very first ingredient is Propylene Glycol - do some research on this chemical - it is reported to have severe adverse health effects including contact dermatitis and allergies, kidney and liver damage. I didn't need to research any of the other ingredients as this first one was enough for me to toss the remaining deodorant in the trash. I'm completely and totally offended that this company would put itself out there as producing a healthy, safe product when in fact it contains harmful chemicals. Yes, it has no aluminum, paraben or alcohol, but it does contain toxic substances. Buyer beware!"
148612,1,I usually mix 2 to 3 cups with 32 ounces of water and drink this while I'm working out. It gives me plenty of energy to continue my work out past the two-hour mark which is plenty for me. Unless I can find something better I buy this product again

326220,0,"This shaver does perform adequately, but to my immense chagrin, the package stated that no replacement foils or blades are made for this model. It is a ""throw-away"" device. In fact, it even states on the package that it has an estimated lifespan of one year. Remington's honesty in this instance is commendable, but it nothing to allay my annoyance that in this day and age of economic turmoil, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, short-lifespan devices like this are still being made. Most of them will be discarded in landfills, where whatever toxic materials contained within will eventually leak into the water table. This is too high a price to pay in the long run for a little short-term convenience."

A couple of times, the bars were slightly melted or crushed, probably during storage at Amazon or in shipment.My local supermarket carries these bars, and though it's more expensive than buying them on Amazon, I've started to buy them at the supermarket because it's easier to see what I'm getting."
388334,0,"I would not call this product an ""end all, be all"" for treating acne prone skin, but it is helpful in reducing outbreaks and treating skin at home. The peels used at the dermatologist or medspa are of far stronger concentration and therefore more effective, but this product is better than not having a peel to use several times a week."

But in any case, the wipes stay warm in the warmer and they stay moist. Just remember to soke the liner every week.If you use pop up wipes though, the wipe on top doesn't stay that warm unless you restuff that top wipe back into the main warmer unit.I got this item as a gift and honestly, knowing that my daughter doesn't care all that much whether or not her wipes are warm, I wouldn't buy it for myself."
252660,1,I get this from my chiropractor & it has helped my joints tremendously! My 80yr old aunt is having shoulder pain so I bought 2 bottles to send to her. I recommend this product to whoever else I know with arthritis. Sure beats taking pain pills!
267788,0,"When I first started using this product, recommended by my doctor about a year ago, the consistency was very creamy. Once the packaging was changed--each caramel had been a cube, then it changed to a rectangle--the consistency did also. It is now grainy. So far, I'm continuing to use the product, but I much preferred the earlier version. What happened to their quality control?"
199957,0,"I have been taking these pills off and on. If I don't keep my stomach filled for a couple hours after I take them I get nauseated and it lasts at least half the day. Sometimes even if I keep eating I still feel bad, so I am not wanting to take them every day. I am sure they work great, but until I get the nauseous feeling under control, I am going to be in the dark as to how they will work with me. I had LASIK surgery a few years ago so I was hoping these pills would be good for my eyes."

So, I am not blaming the chalky gross taste on the company. It is just gross and chalky. If you are planning to mix it with soy or almond milk and nothing else, please reconsider. I had a hard time downing it."
247750,0,"I was a little disappointed by this razor. The build quality is excellent and it does help shave off everything everywhere, but I would hardly call it safe down below. I shave down there with a regular razor all the time and never had a problem, but I always cut myself with this thing. I won't let it anywhere near now. If you want to be completely hairless, just get a razor (womens seem to work best). If you just need to keep things clean and trim then this is gold."

I was unable to tell that from the description, and the site posts no photos of the inside of the cushion. Unfortunately, this cushion was overly firm for our purposes. If you need something VERY firm, this may be for you -- note that convoluted foam is much softer. I returned this in favor of the convoluted foam cushion. Unfortunately, I'll be out the return postage of $5.55 to Amazon, but I guess a refund of about $7.50 is better than having a useless (to us) product hanging around."
309216,0,"After reading all the favorable reviews, I decided to give this thing a try. I have followed the instructions that came with the cane, and I do think it has helped my back pain slightly. But no great improvement. I plan to continue using to see if prolonged use can improve the results. My biggest disappointment is that the cane is way over priced. Somebody is making a lot of money......"
79114,0,"About a week ago I added whey to my diet, to get more protein. I really hope it's good for me, 'cause it tastes like liquefied board chalk. I have tried it with pretty much everything I have in my refrigerator: 1% milk, whole milk, diluted milk, soy milk, almond milk, plain water, and with coffee. The end result is the same: chalk. I don't want to add sugar or any other sweetener. Guess I'm just going to have to tough it out."
257447,0,I guess I was looking for a miracle but this wasn't it. It did help but I've found that taking individual supplements has worked much better for me than anything else has. Some have complained about the size of the pills but I didn't find that a problem. I think my gullet is above average size though.
211843,0,"The pads are quite hard, and don't have any protrusions to press directly on your tendon, like some other models do. It's rather uncomfortable to wear, and the velcro strap doesn't have any stretchiness to it, so it's hard to use while exercising. Also, it's rather cumbersome to adjust. On the other hand, it works OK, and looks like it won't fall apart after a few uses. I have a much better strap that I also use, by MaxCare, but they're not sold in the US."
260362,2,"This was a waste of money, the item was late, package was torn up,and the tea was terrible, not a good product in my opinion and bad handling."

146362,0,Doesn't really eliminate dry heels... it just moisturizes temporarily; just like almost every other brand of skin cream. It's OK... but not a miracle.
25931,0,"I boughter these because my kid's games were eating through regular batteries. But when charging, the battery charge would indicate that batteries were fully charged, but wouldn't last very long, and sometimes they would last for a couple of days. Good price though."
123314,0,"The bottles are very small, but they will go a long way if you only use a few drops (and that's really all you need) at a time. I wish there were other sampler packs with some of the other flavors. I noticed that I don't really get a lot of the actual advertised flavor in my foods and drinks, more or less just a little sweetness. Probably plain stevia would do the same thing."
30604,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
330395,2,"I bought this shaver at BB&B; over a year ago and stubbornly used it for all that time. I finally gave up and started using an older motel Norelco again. The older shaver is great. The arcitec, other than its' design is the worst Norelco I've used in close to the fifty (yes 50) years I've used Norelco electric shavers. It's a slow shave. Tricky spots like chin and moustache needed to be gone over and over again to get a decent shave. It doesn't hold whiskers, but lets them fall all over the sink and floor.It does look great, but as I said, that's it. If you want a Norelco buy one of the older models and steer clear of the arcitec."
186790,2,"This is, as has been said before, a fun toy. However, the smell is strong! If you are like me and are reading this review now, having read a few reviews already, and thinking to yourself that ""those people must be exaggerating, or they have super sensitive noses"" think again. I made that mistake. It IS a fun toy, but the plastic strawberry scent is EXTREMELY stubborn. After having washed it with 3 separate soaps 5 times, the scent is still very prevalent. The only way it went away was when I dunked it in my bathroom sink. Only completely submerged in water does that plastic strawberry smell go away, and even that was only temporary, because as soon as it was pulled from the baptismal sink the smell came rushing back. Wish I had paid attention to the other reviewers about the scent. I would much prefer this toy with no scent whatsoever."

We've chosen vitamin D3 as natural cholecalciferol (derived from sheep's wool lanolin) for our Vitamin D soft gels, rather than the less effective vitamin D2 synthetic form (ergocalciferol)."
174342,0,I use rainwater collected from my garden to flush my sinuses and haven't felt too good lately. My doctor said I may have a chronic Naegleria fowleri infection but I'm thinking it may just be the dry weather. I'll let it run it's course and see how I feel in a couple days.
386448,0,"So, this is not a ""miracle product"" but it does a decent job of minimizing snoring. The regular Breathe Right strips deserve about a 3 star rating, because the reduction of noise is still apparent, but it is not the perfect product. Bottom line, don't expect miracles, but if you would like an affordable way to achieve snore reduction and are not a fan of the vapor rub smell, this product would be it. I have not noticed any difference between the clear and the tan strips, but normal exfoliation of the removal of these strips is normal, since this is kinda like a band aid for your nose."
367297,0,I use my electric shaver for touch-up or a weekend shave when I don't want to go through the hassle of shaving with a razor. I found the Remington to be a bit of a disappointment as it did not shave as close as the 20 year old Braun that it replaced and occasionally pulled at my beard.
336906,0,"I have to agree with several of the other reviewers, where I do feel better that we are using a product that will hopefully cause less stress on the Earth -- and on us -- even if it might not clean as thoroughly as other eco-friendly products. (Since we got our dishwasher we have only used eco cleaners in it, although growing up my mom used Cascade powder which I seem to recall did an OK job in cleaning but was probably chemically bad for us as well as the Earth.)I loved, loved, loved Method dish cubes but they are not be making them anymore which is a shame; cleaned well and came in easy-to-use cubes and weren't cheap but were environmentally friendly -- bleach-free. As a second choice, though, this product is OK. The lemon scent is fine. Some dishes when loaded too closely together get slightly filmy, although never the whole load and not enough to run the spotty few through twice."

That made me think I need to step up to the red and black combo and after a month or so broke both cords for small hands and large hands. Let me say that I got smallish hands and they are not very strong to say the least and the bands just wear out far too quick.Now I got the ""last man standing"" from this sorry trio of hand strengtheners in the form of the Orange and Gray ball/cord combo for ""strength training"" and I'll probably break those considering how the other products have performed.I really was into the Handmaster Plus since it worked great for a little while. However, I do not recommend any of the Handmaster Plus balls since they are not durable at all.Simply put good idea but poor quality."

However, I kept a stash of Micheelle's Miracle CherriMax around and when ever I would start to feel a flare up I would take a couple.

201004,0,The quality of the brush seems top notch and it looks very nice but I find it to be too stiff to work up a good lather. Perhaps it would work better for lathering directly on the face rather than in a bowl. It's also rather tall and fat and it doesn't fit in my usual brush holder. I've used it a few times but now it just sits on the shelf.
400125,0,"I came here to buy a second one of these because I like our first so much. We have used it from day one of life with a new baby (the white noise setting helps her sleep) and wanted another for a different room, but see that the price has gone up drastically. I only paid $13.99 a few months ago. How is it that the price has gone up so much? I would have given this five stars, but now I am only giving it 3 since the price suddenly outdoes the quality."
106691,2,Bought this to replace my Braun shaver after I lost the charger. Feels cheap. It is very quiet but I guess that also makes me feel like it is not doing the job. Any hairs longer than a day or two growth does not get touched. Just not doing the trick for me. Wish I would have stuck with the Braun brand.

I had intended to use it on my office chair but quickly found out the lumber support and the massage cushion didn't gel.

256454,0,"I suffered from what I believe was a chronic yeast overgrowth. My Kaiser docs were less than useless in diagnosing the problem. After multiple diabetes, B12 deficiency, CBC and more tests that were all negative, I decided to take matters into my hands by trying ThreeLac. While I can't say that all my problems disappeared overnight, they reduced in intensity fairly quickly and after 4 months using ThreeLac (1 - 3 doses a day depending on intensity of symptoms) I can say that I am back to 80% health. It took a lot more time and money than what other reviewers have claimed but it is the one product that has seemed to do some temporary good. I also combined this with a greatly sugar reduced diet from the book ""Feast without Yeast"" to achieve results. Still this isn't a cure for my symptoms."
106471,0,"I'm a bit disappointed with this squeegee, and here is why:- While it is made out of stainless steel, the handle's wide metal part is a bit loose, making a slight rattling sound. This might just be the particular one I received but I actually think it could be a design flaw: The handle consists of these two thinner parts with the wider part simply slid over it. At least mine has too much spiel there, and the wide part can be slid up and down but is never quite tight enough, thus causing the rattling.- Also, the ergonomics of the handle aren't stellar. The Amazon product picture shows only the front side of the squeegee, but on the back side the wide metal part is simply bent around the two thinner ""branches"" of the handle. It simply does not feel that great to hold.- I used a squeegee with a 12"" blade before and the 8"" on this model seem very small in comparison. I usually squeegee my entire shower - glass and tiles and it is a lot more work with an 8"" model than with a bigger one. Of course this is not a product flaw, I just wanted to mention it for people who also need one for bigger spaces.The squeegee action itself seems to be very good, however - a firm blade which removes water well. So there are good things and not so good things about this product. I don't think I would buy it again, but other people might have different priorities."

The flavor is ok--it's pretty chaulky but that's to be expected. The serving size seems large...taking it every day would last me like 2 weeks. I wish the bottle were bigger.

68378,1,"Last year I received a full-sized set of the Art of Shaving products as a Christmas gift. I enjoy the shaving process now more than ever, and my face looks and feels better than it did after using various other creams, gels, and soaps. However, I wanted a travel-sized set to take along on local overnighters so I got this Starter Kit. The kit worked out well, especially since it introduced me to the benefits of the shaving brush.Although I favor the AOS unscented line for sensitive skin, the Sandalwood set worked just fine for weekend usage during a recent weekend up in Seattle at a friend's house. The smell is masculine, pleasing, and not overpowering, plus the individual bottles are small enough to fit inside my kit bag. But the brush was the most pleasant surprise of the kit. It feels good on my face, and really maximizes the shaving cream by creating a thick lather out of a tiny dollop.My sensitive skin and thick beard have forced me to try various shaving products over the years. Finally, in middle age I believe that I've found what I've been looking for in the Art of Shaving product line (see my other Amazon reviews of individual AOS products for more detail). The Starter Kit is an excellent and inexpensive way to see if the AOS line is right for you, and I encourage anyone looking for a better shaving experience to give it a try."

326378,0,"I bought this product a few months ago and used it religiously for about a month and a half. I would use it after cleansing morning and night. I can't say that I love the product, but I also do not hate it either. The smell at first was very odd and almost unbearable, but it quickly went away and after reading about the wonderful things it could do for acne, I sucked it up. After about 2 or 3 weeks, the smell did not bother me so I was happy about that; I think I just got used to it. After using this for a month and a half, I can say that it did not do anything for my acne. It did not make it better, or worse. The only thing it really did was clean up the extra things my cleanser did not and it dried my face out slightly (I do have a sensitive face so, this might be the reason. However, I am usually pretty oily). Also, for those looking for an ""all natural"" product, this one is not. It is 14% alcohol. For me, I am trying to find more natural products and go away from the chemicals and I was disappointed that a good percentage of this was alcohol. Alcohol can be an irritant for the skin so beware. I recently just bought ""Thayer: Witch Hazel Toner"" and it is alcohol free and seems to be working on my acne. It does not have the odd smell and I love it so far. It also does not dry out my skin. I would suggest trying that one instead of Dickinsons.However, I will keep this bottle as Witch Hazel has other uses besides on the face. I give them credit because it was a good price for a large bottle and it will last a very long time. I just would not recommend for the face or for curing acne as it did nothing for me."
129106,0,"I have been looking for a roomy pill organizer for a long time, and this one fits the bill. Along with my prescriptions, I take vitamins, many of which are large in size. While this would probably be too large for a handbag, it will be great for travel and home use. Finally, one pill organizer, instead of 2 and 3, and it is uncomplicated, easy to use, and sturdy. 3 stars because I would have preferred to have a pop top that would open all units at once for easier filling, and one where the units open to the outside and stay open to easily refill all at once. Also the space in the front of the unit is not accessible for use, and is wasted space."

60927,0,"I got this product as a promotion attached to a bottle of Veet. I decided to try it on my face, and while it did remove a lot of the hair...it also caused my skin to peel really badly the next day (and for several days afterwards, which is fairly embarrasing when it's on your face). In case you're wondering, yes, I did try it on another area of skin first to be sure I wouldn't be allergic to it as per the package directions. I guess the bottom line is: If you have sensitive skin, be very careful when using this product!"
315561,0,I got this for the office so I would have something to exercise my hand and just some silly putty to play around with. It starts pretty tough to work with put eventually as it warms up the putty resistance gets softer. Over time (2 weeks of so of frequent use) it becomes in my mind too soft. I would suggest getting one resistance up for those that want to use this to create shapes for fun and want to hold those shapes for a longer period of time.If you are using it I guess for its intend use for therapy it works pretty well as it has enough resistance to exercise the hand without immediately tiring the wrist or hand out.

216171,0,"I have been running with various flavors of Cliffs gels, but recently made the switch to try this product. On one hand I think the extra sodium is helpful, at least I felt it helped during a half marathon last month, but the package is aweful. You would expect a quick tear top or some sort of notch to make it easy to open. But no. You can't really tear it with your teeth alone without battling the package and then once you get it open, it doesn't open on the side so you wind up gumming the package and fighting to get to the soggy bottom. Great idea, held badly back by the packaging"

112357,0,The mask is comfortable around the face area but after a week or so of use the straps started irritating my ears. My ears are sore and some skin around the lobe is chaffing. They need to design a more comfortable strap. Even more irritating though is that the mask does not seal well around the nose. Light gets in around the nose area and makes it difficult to fall asleep. My bedroom window faces east and I get a lot of bright sunlight in the morning. I was hoping this mask would solve that problem. It didn't.Edit: I have washed this mask a few times since I bought it and it is falling apart badly now. I was even sure to wash it gently and let it hang dry. Now I'm back on Amazon looking for a replacement.

138096,0,I bought this product for a more healthy approach to waxing so that my skin doesn't take in all the bad chemicals that are in those other commercial ones ... this one only problem I've seen with this one is that you have to keep it on for at least a good 20 min - to make sure it hardens enough- in order for you to be able to remove a good amount of hair.. If you don't mind the time then by all means
157093,1,"Absolutely a great product. Olbas is the answer to sinus problems, congestion and many other breathing problems. And is much safer than pharmecutical drugs!! Great price and fast shipping. Would definitely recommend this seller."
24489,1,"I have had multiple neuroma surgeries and the neuromas have recurred, so I have significant pain in my forefoot. The only answer from the surgeon was cutting loose my achilles tendon, which I didn't want to do. These cushions really, really help and have allowed me to continue Bollywood dance. The glue is really surprisingly long-lasting after rinsing. However, if I use them without socks the edges get stuck on my shoe and can bunch up. So they can't be used without socks or barefoot. Combining these with using rocker shoes most days have kept me from pain and surgery. None of the 20 other products I have purchased at the store worked."

271157,2,"I recently purchased some Serenity Tena Heavy Pads at CVS, when I ran out of Depend Boost Inserts. I found that they work much better, because the adhesive sticky surface actually holds the booster pad securely to the adult diaper. Depend Boost inserts separate from the diaper when the patient's adult diaper is changed in the morning. Part of this may be due to the fact that the curved shape of the Serenity Tena product is better. Now that I have located a superior alternative product, I am going to cancel my subscription to Depend Boost Inserts. The folks who manufacture Depend Booster pads need to fix the problem with the adhesive."

Seller has taken them back each time but Wahl customer service (Michelle) doesn't care & or their corporate policy is to tell you to ""send it back to them & they will look at it."" So I have to spend money to send it back & be without a razor. Customer service says no bad batch of product & offer no assistance that matters. Furthermore, bought another Wahl razor with a lithium battery (model 9854) which worked on an initial test, just running it but not using it, which worked fine. Went to actually use it & stopped working. Won't take a charge. Wahl, these products I have purchased & customer service are inferior. Will never buy another Wahl product.

410988,0,"I agree with some of the other people that reviewed this item and complained about the wax itself. The wax itself feels more like a glue then a wax. It leaves a really super thin but sticky residue on the skin. On one hand, it makes it easier to pull the hair off, but on the other hand it is so hard to get the glue-like substance off your skin. It kind of looks like the residue after you have had a band-aid on for a long time, and you have to scrub and scrub in the shower to get the last bits off. After showering I scrubbed and scrubbed in the shower, got out and my legs were still sticky then all the lint from the towels and clothing stuck to the invisible like glue coating on my skin. I had to get back in the shower and scrub again. Maybe there is a special wax remover product that I should be using this with? Also I was hoping that I would be able to interchange other brands of wax such as depileve in the roller, but it seems ?? that only the same brand wax as roller is compatible."

I gave it to someone else who said it works for them so it wasn't a total waste of money.

392299,0,"I purchased this stuff at Walmart. It looks exactly like the light pink bottle/dark pink cap product does here on Amazon. It says for ""legs AND body"", so I tried it on my chest and back. The chest existed no pain after removal. However, unlike what the bottle says, after leaving it on my chest for about 8 or 9 minutes, it left stubble. So, it appears that it does NOT go to the root like what most Nair products claim to do.Now, my back, on the other hand, wasn't too pleasant. I had my mom apply this to my back, and waited just under 10 minutes until wiping/showering off. It all came off, but even just before removing, my back did get tingling sensations, like anything would give off to show you that it is working. After showering everything off though, my back felt like it was sunburned--up to a day after--however, there was no stubble like on the chest. So...I'm not sure what to do. Maybe I should just not use this on my back and just regularly shave it with an electric razor from now on, and use the Nair only on my chest. Don't want to put my back through that again.Haven't used it on my legs yet, but will try it eventually."

327389,2,It doesn't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed. I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor. Atleast It has a taste.
343262,0,Overall I like this brush! The size and shape of both the brush and handle are good. I also like the fact that the brush can be removed from the handle so it is not limited to just my back. The only complaint I have is the bristles are too soft and wear out quickly.
55285,0,"This is the only cover I could find to fit my thin changing table pad. So what I like the most is that it actually fits! I also like the color. It's a nice, deep red. But it is very thin and started to pill after 1 wash. Not the best quality, but does the job."

112186,0,"My children seemed to really like them. They have a slightly different taste than what I expected. They're almost like a Fig Newton chewy. They were very filling and helped us feel that we were no longer hungry. They helped us feel more energetic. My family tried the product and the children seemed to be the most impressed, although the adults also thought that they felt more """"alive""""."
169381,0,"As rumored yes it is tasteless, however a little bit gritty when you mix it by itself, but for me i add a teaspoon with ON whey protein and i cant even taste the grittiness. As far as the bloating that people are worried about, for me i have noticed a couple more pounds on the scale while using this product. I dont know if its directly due to the fact im using creatine or what, however i dont feel bloated. My reason for buying this product as well as everyone else out there was to get some extra reps out of my sets. and i have notice a difference with certain muscle groups but not all. For example i noticed i cant do a couple more reps with chest and shoulder exercises, but my biceps and triceps remain for the most part the same. Only had a couple weeks with this product, maybe a further evaluation down the road. Only 3 stars due to not noticing a full improvement on all body parts."
134711,0,"We replaced our older model with this one. While it's more compact and nicer to look at on the counter everyday, it lacks the power of our older less, attractive model, plus there are a myriad of attachments we will almost never use, which are stored in the water tank cover, but it doens't snap shut, so that's a little odd too.All in all, it's got great contemporary looks, but could use more force and functionality."
364235,0,"I purchase this massage machine is because it is not expensive. For the cost verse quality, it is a good deal. However, in the highest vibration setting, it is too weak compare with Korean made ""Mediness"" similar product. This product provides continous strength adjustment and head replacement. Because the strongest vibration setting is not strong enough, the adjustment feature becomes useless. If you don't expect stronger vibration, it is a bargain."
322779,0,"I used Cortislim for about 6 weeks with a few co-workers back in the late fall. I have to admit that I did notice that my pants were fitting differently (my middle area seemed slimmer). I don't think that I dropped a lot of weight in pounds though. I did have a bit more energy too. The problem I had was the Christmas holidays rolled around and I quit using...pounds came back. Now that it is spring, a few of us are going to try it once more, EXCERISE while using it, and go from there. I think you will be pleased if you don't have unrealistic expectations....you will have to work at the weight loss and not just pop the pills."

79397,0,"I was looking for a lower cost alternative to my GNC products, but this wasn't it. I take it mostly as a dietary meal replacement. I bought the &#34;standard chocolate,&#34; but it wasn't very flavorful. With other protein powders, I get 3-4 hours of fullness, but with this I only get about 2. The whey also doesn't dissolve very well and it seems like 1/3 of it ends up just stuck to the inside of my mixing container. This is not a bad product, but not one I would recommend. I would put this one third behind GNC and Costco in terms of flavor, effectiveness, and value."
14717,0,"I started taking this herb when I first started nursing because I was determined to be able to meet the needs of my hungry little boy, and it certainly did help increase my milk supply noticeably. At first I was taking 2 capsules 3 times a day, but it seemed like I had an oversupply, so I cut down to 1 capsule 3 times a day. All was fine until my son hit about 12 weeks, and my normally mellow infant starting having screaming fits and became very gassy and fussy. I was also very gassy but thought this was a normal part of postpartum recovery.I tried eliminating the usual culprits from my diet, and never thought to consider that fenugreek was causing the gas in both myself and the baby. It's been about 4 days since I stopped taking fenugreek and my gas is gone, and the baby is much happier.I know fenugreek helped me establish my milk supply and has helped a lot of others boost theirs, but it just didn't agree with me or my baby. I've gone to mother's milk tea (which has a lot less fenugreek and many of the other herbs that support healthy lactation). Here's to hoping for more milk and less gas!"
103124,0,"I purchased two VioLight units a little over 3 years ago and have been relatively happy with them. Even had a problem with one not working only a few months after I had purchased it, and the company sent out a new base which fixed the known problem.Recently on one of my units the soft on/off button has actually split open, is becoming hard and brittle, and it is becoming very difficult to turn it off and on. I would think being the most used part of the unit (that would be pressed at least once if not several times a day if up to four people are using it) that this would not break/tear easily.I emailed customer service asking if I could somehow replace the button, and that I would not expect an essential part of the unit to fail after a only few years (especially given the price)! Their response (complete with no capitalization, incorrect grammar, spelling errors and lack of punctuation in only a few sentence response!) was that they don't sell the bases separately, but they would let me purchase another new unit on their website for a 20% discount.Sorry, I will be looking elsewhere for a replacement toothbrush sanitizer. As much as I like this unit (and have given it as a gift many times) I will not purchased from a company that does not stand behind their products and does not value their customers. The little soft blue circular button is present on many of their products, so buyer beware!"
378080,2,"Ours cracked in one spot. Also, the sling is not attached or secured at the bottom so it is wobbly when you put the baby on it...

It is much more secure - I didn't see it online or I would suggest it."

408476,0,"I had been using a cheap Norelco Electric shaver prior to this. So far, in the first few days, the Braun has given me a close enough shave, but design has made it difficult to get under the jaw and neck. Some problems I've been having so far are as follows:1. When shaving, a lot of hair tends to leak out or not get caught in the shaver. This leaves a mess of hair powder on the sink and on my shirt. I don't know if this is common, or if it's just because I have been using it to cut hair after a couple days, but it never happened with my norelco.2. The self-cleaner seems like a scam. Sure it cleans the razor, and then dries it out...but how exactly does it know how clean your razor is? I used it once, and it read ""eco clean"" so I was satisfied...it sat in the charger for 3 days, unused, and now it says ""normal clean"". I don't know how it got more dirty in that time. So I used it again, for longer hair, and it still reads ""normal."" So, when the cleaner runs out, go buy more.Other than that I've been pretty satisfied. But can't help wonder when the hair piles up while shaving, and I'm having to buy more cleaning fluid every couple months...was this razor really worth $150+ dollars? I don't know."

427214,0,"Overall, I think the product is OK. I was looking for a replacement for the Black and Decker/Craftsman Scrubber which has become difficult to find. Price is lots better than either, probably because it doesn't use re-chargeable batteries, but replaceable batteries -- but when the supplied AA batteries die, I plan to use my own rechargeable batteries. My actual satisfaction can be raised to a 4 or 5 star level; however, I feel uneasy about this product being available for a long time (short product life) and I have doubts about the accessories. I prefer the B&D/Craftsman scrubber attachments. There is a much smaller assortment of attachments and they seem less durable and light-weight compared to the older model B&D/Craftsman scrubber. The older model Black and Decker/Craftsman scrubbers that used the VersaPak batteries were lots better in many ways; for instance the scrubber pads were replaceable and much thicker while the scrubber accssories is just a thin scrubber on a sponge so the whole accessory head must be replaced rather than just the scrubber pad. Also, while an address was given for parts, no indication of type or cost of accessories available. Possibly, the lower cost advantage of this newer product will be overshadowed by the higher cost of replacement parts. After just a short usage, the two scrubber accessories looks like they need to be replaced after just a short amount of usage. The only relatively durable accessory head appears to be the nylon brush usually shown in the product description; but I suspect it will need to be replaced soon also -- The question of replacement of the whole unit vs. buying replacement accessories bothers me."
28492,0,"Tastes great, easy to make and well priced. I ordered 2 tubs and it wasn't delivered within the ETA time frame. I wrote to the seller multiple times with no response. Waited approx 2 weeks after ETA and finally received it. Be careful who you deal with."
346282,0,"In the past I've found that adding MSM to my daily supplements greatly decreased arthritis discomfort, but then couldn't find the brand I liked anymore. I was eager to try this brand because each tablet has a high dose. I took one tab a day for a week, but then noticed I was very bloated as though I'd eaten too much salty food. I also didn't notice any decrease in pain which I had almost immediately before. This was a very short trial and not very scientific, but I decided to quit the product until the swelling subsided. It could possibly have been caused by something else.I plan to try the product again in a more controlled situation while I also keep my sodium intake from other sources low. I'll update if I get different results. It is worth saying though that the other brand seemed to make a difference in how I felt within a day or two and this one didn't. It may be metabolized differently and one needs a longer period to notice any change. Since I know MSM does help how my knees feel from my past experience, it seems worth a trial to see if it helps you."
10158,0,"I usually use Designer Whey Protein but decided to give the vanilla Met-Rx a try. After reading other reviews I was a little worried about the taste but when I opened it the powder smelled good and very vanilla. The morning after an intense heavy weight lifting workout I was so sore I could barely move and lol even had to help myself to some tylenol. That night right before bed I made a 16 ounce shake with two scoops and Vanilla Silk (instead of water or milk or juice) the taste was okay even though it did seem to have that slight similarity to a diet soda lol. The Vanilla Silk worked well and when i got up the next day I was barely even sore anymore. You don't build muscle in the gym, you build it while you sleep :) Another 8 ounce shake in the morning and by the following day I was able to workout again and within 4 days put on 2lbs :) I think I'll start using this for my post workout shake within 20 minutes of finishing my workout and see how much progress it makes. I'd say for anyone who has problems with the taste you could try it with Silk instead and see how you like it.(Edit: After several weeks of using this product for weight training it caused a problem and I would caution anyone who doesn't drink a TON of water and Fiber to avoid it or use it sparingly) Otherwise I'd say if your going to be using this for 3 protein shakes a day morning, post workout and before bed to purchase miralax along with it lol."

However, the readings fluctuated badly between uses, so it was hard to trust it.

My dad bought a manual blood pressure monitor later, which he said to be more reliable than this electronic one."
43178,0,"First off, this stuff does work. And it appears to be packed with less strange ingredients than my Scrubbing Bubbles or Tilex options.However, the smell is admittedly a little odd - like, mahogany and licorice, almost.

181091,0,"The face cradle is not as pictured, it is a sharp edged ply-wood ""C"" mounted on metal arms. The finish on the metal arms is uneven and ""lumpy"" on one arm and it wont fit into the hole at the end of the table. Once I was able to force it into place, I had to sit on the ground and brace the table with my feet in order to pull it back out. Also, the face cradle moves once positioned and tightened... and Ive yet to find a way to avoid this. It has one adjusting mechanism for two arms, and there is a lot of give once in place. The wood on the table is unfinished, not a big deal just letting you know what to expect. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if not for the face cradle. I cant even find a link on the order to contact the seller about this?"

59795,0,I called the company because my concern is how they decaffeinate their product and I was disappointed that they used some solvent (ethanol in the process) rather than the safer CO2 process. So I ordered ECGC from NOW and its fairly decaffeinated only 4 mg of caffeine and they use the CO2 method. Do your research. I think if you are going to take something for your health then it should not have residues which may be undesirable.
181505,0,"Sturdy and heavy. I believe the frame is steel rather than aluminum like my last one. Seat is lower than my last one, too. This is more comfortable for me because I am only 5'3"", but because of the design the seat does not have a catch when it is lifted up to use the basket underneath or to fold it up. The heavy wooden seat flops around when I load it in and out of my trunk. I am trying to figure out a way to make a catch for the seat that will not decrease its functionality. If I wasn't hauling it around everywhere, this probably wouldn't bother me."

Replacing the internal battery is always too expensive. The other parts usually work fine!This trimmer solves the battery problem by allowing you to use your own batteries. This really extends the life of the trimmer.I use rechargeable NiMH batteries (which are less powerful then standard alkaline batteries), and the trimmer works fine. It's powerful enough, and I don't need to waste another set of alkalines."

And, no, you cannot swing from it like a monkey. That said, it functioned exactly as we had hoped, and we would highly recommend it for someone willing to use it as directed."

I do really like the fact that I only have to take one of these TINY little pearls once a day, and that I can keep them in my purse since they require no refrigeration. However, I am disappointed to say that so far I have noticed zero improvement despite taking one each & every day. I will continue to take them daily since I bought a 90-day supply and from what I have read, they are good for you whether they actually seem to help or not. Once the 90 days are up, I may try another probiotic, but so far am not impressed w/them in general and wonder if any would help me at all :-("

247899,0,"After a year of a good grooming, the unit's switch suddenly got stuck in the ""on"" position. Middle of the night, total silence in the house.. Except for what sounded like a huge vibrator. Had to shove it under a pillow and wait till the batteries died. Arrrgh.Now, how do you fix that? Pretty simple. The switch is getting stuck because of the vacuum developing inside of the watertight container. The unit is getting hot in the shower, pressure inside increases, and it (somehow) releases that pressure. Eventually, you are getting enough vacuum to suck the membrane that covers the switch almost all the way in. All you have to do to fix that is let some air in.First, make sure the unit is dry in and out. Use a compressed air can to blow water drops out of hard to reach places if you have to. You don't want to let any water get inside! Now, remove the head. Just pull it out.Next, using a flathead screwdriver or utility knife, pull out those silvery colored side moldings. The case will open like a clamshell. You will find a fairly small watertight container with all of the electrical components inside. Carefully pull out any of the latches that are used to keep it closed. Pull two latches if that wasn't enough; your on/off switch membrane will immediately ""pop"" back into shape.Reseal the unit back like it was before. Works like new!"

The only thing I was offered was a discount on a new replacement but the ""discounted"" price was $10 more than I could buy it for at a local retail store. I will look for a new monitor from a more reputable manufacturer."
107278,0,"I took 2 pills last night. I did feel drowsy within the first half hour. I've been having insomnia lately and don't want to take prescription pills for sleeping. I will say that you really have to wash these pills down good. They are a little large and they didn't go down easily for me. I suffer with a nervous stomach and it seemed to help a little with that which I was pleased about, however, I was still up the entire night, like every hour. I may try it one more time to see if it makes a difference, or maybe I should have taken 3 pills like the bottle suggested."
42088,0,This did provide comfortable support but the straps that go around your neck were way to visible at the collars of my shirts. They were snug against my neck so that they couldn't help but show. I had to return it because I just couldn't wear it with summer shirts. It would be fine in the winter with a turtleneck.I bought another one instead that is called Mother-to-Be and it does a great job giving my belly the needed support.

106065,1,"After several years of giving myself ""buzz-cuts"" I decided to go for a quality set of clippers. I had been using one of those kits which included all of the plastic guards etc. which fell in the $30 price range at Target. There is NO comparison. The Oster Classic 76 is the ""Cadillac"" of clippers. From the moment you turn them on, you can tell by the smoothness and power of the motor that you have stepped up to top quality clippers. They come with a [1] blade and a [000] blade. I purchased a [0000] which is great for real close shaves or fades. I'm confident these will last for years since I'm using them at home and not in a shop. I would definitely buy this brand again !"
118285,0,"Might work well for plastic bags, but I was unhappy with it as soon as I tried to put a paper yard waste bag on it. I bought it special-order from local Ace Hardware, and returned it without even completing assembly.I checked the online measurements and figured since it is five inches wider than the bags it would be fine. On the Ames website, the catalog shows it with a paper bag on it. But my 30-gallon paper municipal yard waste bags are 3 inches too wide to fit the base well. You need to crunch in two corners to fit between those red plastic ""arms"" the two wheels are attached to. It would work, but it's more of a hassle than if it really fit right plus you won't get your bag as full.The wheels seem cheap and poorly-designed - they pop on with these little expanding tabs like a toy (you won't ever take them back off again). They might last fine, but they do not even spin freely. Otherwise it seems well-made and sturdy and well-designed.Ideally it should have been made about three inches wider, three or four inches deeper and six inches taller to use it for paper yard-waste bags. I would have definitely paid $5 or $10 more for this cart it if it was larger ($10 or $15 with better wheels), but somebody skimped. The paper leaf bags come within an inch or two of the top of the handle, however since the arms to hold the top of the sack adjust up and down the bars easily (and my fingers aren't more than an inch thick) this is not really a problem.Instead I will find a larger generic hand cart with a base large enough to set the Young Mfg funnel for paper bag on it (an excellent product even though it takes lots of storage space).YOUNG MANUFACTURING LLC #WB-31-10 LWN FunnelFor Paper BagI plan to use the funnel with a leaf mulcher positioned on top of it (DR power mulcher, similar to the Flowtron sold hereFlowtron The Ultimate Mulcher 8 Amp Electric Leaf Shredder #LE-900- basically a weed trimmer inside a plastic barrell). Also an 18 in wide Target spiral hamper on the top of the mulcher funnel with the bottom cut out Spiral Pop-Up Hamper(for a see-through shield to keep dust and bits of leaves from flying everywhere), and the Midwest Quality 45TA leaf claws I bought on Amazon to feed it.Midwest Quality Glove 45TA Lawn Claws Leaf ScoopsShould make a good system for quickly mulching and bagging leaves - many times faster than the Toro leaf vac which jams a lot even though with a metal impeller it works better than any other I've tried.Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum With Metal Impeller #51599Now I'll just use the leaf vac to blow the leaves into a leaf haulerEZ Leaf Hauler 7-by 5-Feet #0007If I wanted to use this Ames seasonal cart for plastic bags, I might still give it 4 or 5 stars. For paper yard-waste bags though, I'd give it just two stars for such an obvious design flaw."

356222,1,I have used this product and it works great. I noticed a change in my skin tone within two weeks and I only used it at night before bed. The color became more even and had a natural brightness. For the price it is a great product and I highly recommend this product.
84771,0,"Yes, the monitor works, but the description says that it is ""unmistakeable"". Not true. There was an instance (during a fertile time) when the monitor ""read"" the stick and gave a result of ""high"" even though the liquid had not yet passed through the test area that was ""read"" by the machine. It could have been a peak day, but I would not have known that had I not also been taking my temperature and using OPKs in addition to the monitor use.If you choose to buy this product, be sure the watch your fluids pass beyond the test area before placing the stick in the machine."

I would highly recommend it since I like everything about it (especially the fact that it is battery powered so you can travel with it easily to Europe etc.) except if it lasted."

The upper and lower side ""guards"" that prevent swallowing the whole device actually protrude into your upper and lower gum line, creating some morning soreness.

370522,0,"If you've never had one of these, do yourself a favor and try one before you commit to an entire box. They're sweet, sticky, and really chewy, and they'll do a great job of giving you energy and killing your appetite. That may actually be a good thing, depending on the context.I don't eat these much lately, but there was a time when I was very busy at work, and I didn't want to take a half-hour for lunch and pay $7.00, and I didn't bring my lunch, but I had a box of these and it took only one to get me to totally forget about food for several hours. Power indeed."
342873,0,it worked ok but it took a long time and it is very hard to keep it from running onto skin that is not affected. i purchased it for my six year old and while it was better than having the lazer treatment -- it took about three months for it to be completely effective.
91733,1,"I bought some batteries before that weren't included, it was very disappointing. It should say on the package if they are included or not, be sure to check."
288642,0,"This product is perfect of organizing batteries in that messy kitchen drawer but if you are looking for a reliable tester don't count on this one. The 9V tester works great but the others no so much. I primarily purchased this product for the organization factor and eliminating searching for batteries for the kid's toys, so I am happy with product and it fits perfectly into a drawer, I would most likely purchase again. It would nice to have a cheaper option without the tester, because let's face it when the thing stops working the batteries are probably dead so why bother with testing them."

299338,0,"Well one should have the better sense than to believe the claims made when any products claims it can enhance the sexual pleasure than that was certainly the case with these Trojan Condoms. Despite the claims the experience was nothing really different for her, certainly not more so than the average condom. They do their job as well as any other condom and ultimately that's the important thing. But in terms of enhancing the pleasure while wearing them I'd have to say that these were nothing special or out of the ordinary. I can't remember if they cost anymore than regular Trojans, if so then sticj with the regular ones. If not I guess you can give them a try yourself and see if there's a difference.Other than that they are the usual Trojan quality...strong, not quite thin enough, well lubricated, etc."

317044,0,"I loved the idea of this wipes warmer, and in fact, I considered it the one ""luxery item"" on my registry. My son seems to love the warm wipes and will flinch when I use the wipes straight from the container, so yes, warm wipes are better.However, the problem is with the warmer's design. There is a top flap that will not stay closed and the sponge inside dries out, browns (although the sponge's package calls it a non-browning sponge) and cracks!! I even tried to keep the top lid shut with electrical tape and it still pops open!! My son is only 4 weeks old and I have had to replace the sponge which is supposed to last at least 3 months. In addition, the sponge needs to be re-wetted at least twice a week. Very disappointing design, but I will continue to use as long as I can keep re-taping the lid.A word of advice- look at the warmer after each use. If lid is not shut completely, the sponge will dry out very quickly."

268471,0,"Because I do feel a general lessening of depressive symptoms; and I'm sleeping better. However I've since discovered that there is a correlation between St. John's Wort and the subsequent formation of cataracts--- even a decade later--- due to the photo-sensitizing characteristics of this herb. I plan to finish the quanitity that I've purchased but I've reduced the dose (the tablets are easy to bite/break in half) and will probably discontinue use entirely because of this risk. But yes, in my experience the product works and it's a shame that the potential long-term trade-off in eye health is so great. Do your own research and decide what's best for you."
146254,2,"I ordered this because I wanted the convenience of the individual packages, but I have yet to find a way to actually down the stuff without it tasting absolutely horrible. I've tried water, milk, orange juice, coffee, chocolate Slim Fast, and Gatorade, and the ""natural"" flavor just can't be covered up. I gave it two stars because I'm sure it's a decent protein product and I'd imagine the ""Actually Flavored"" versions would taste much better, but I would steer clear of the ""Natural Flavor"" version."
11534,0,"Duracell still makes the best quality batteries; including this set. But there are new better technology. This NiMh is old school. Check out the benefits of the pre-charged batteries before you buy this set. Duracell also make one of the best quality low-discharged batteries out there. Honestly, except for the higher capacity (2650mAH), the low-discharged batteries has more benefits. You can also use them on your remotes or clocks and will last longer between charges. The cost difference is also not much."
227286,0,we have to buy this brand because somehow Burdic / Cardiac Science engineers made their EKG machines work only with their name brand electrodes and paper.The neutral rating is due to the high cost not the quantity of the electrodes themselves
350492,0,Bought this for my husband who loves hot water bottles and or herbal wraps. He really likes this. Heats up fast but I don't think it retains the heat as well as others we have used in the past. It also has a very odd smell once it has been heated that you can faintly smell for days. Hard to describe smell but almost like burnt corn.
211490,2,"I have course hair and an extremely tough beard. (I am also thin and fit.) I have had this Braun for 2 months and am less than unhappy. If I shave every day, it is barely acceptable as it leaves hair despite my going over and over my face for 10+ minutes. If I skip a day, it is about as effective as a shoe. It definitely cannot get to those hairs that lay close to the skin regardless of the technique I use. My only recourse has been to follow my Braun ""shave"" with a straightrazor.I am all the more disappointed because Braun allegedly has a good reputation. It get's one star only because there is no lower grade."

93790,0,I still use this on certain occasions... but... I cannot use it as a cane (walking device) and a seat because the unit is too short when folded so I have to carry a cane and the seat when it's needed. Wish they made the folded length adjustable so it could be used for both! And... FYI.... it is somewhat unstable and easily tips over... would probably not work well for the elderly. Still and yet... it serves it's purpose and I'm glad I have it to use when needed.
263322,1,"I bought this because of the high reviews. The taste is much better then other protein brands, berry blast may not be as popular as the other flavors it its starting to get recognized! I mix it with 20oz of water (tried berry sparkling water and it was REALLY REALLY BAD)and it was great. Highly recommend buying a blender and mixing this with Apple or Orange juice, frozen raspberries, frozen strawberries, and frozen black berries. It makes for a great protein shake with a sour/tangy kick to it. If you can't get a blender right away, go to your local gym and they will mix the berries in for you for a fee."
253534,0,"Ordered this for my mom and she didn't receive all of the parts the first time around. She called the 800 # and the person on the other line was very apologetic and sent her a new one the next day with everything in tact. Be careful when you purchase these items because you need to check to make sure it isn't false advertisement or if there are extra parts needed for these heating pads.All in all, a good experience, my mom is happy and the company gave me 20% for the hassle. Everything worked out in less than 2 days."

378343,0,I chose this product for my registry without reading any reviews. I immediately began using it with my newborn daughter and it worked great. I loved the idea of the plug because you can empty out all the water easily. The only bad part was that there were many cracks which were difficult to keep clean and dry which would cause to get moldy. I thought that was pretty disgusting. But I continued to keep using it until the bottom just all of a sudden cracked one day and I had to throw it out. Now I am pregnant again and am searching for a better tub for my baby.
181485,2,"One star because the program won't let us give it no stars.First, note that this company will not take a return of the merchandise once the plastic seal is opened. That's understandable on one hand but unfortunately, because it comes folded in a smaller footprint than its inflatable size, it is impossible to say whether or not the cushion will work unless you take it out and inflate it. Of course, too, even the inflated cushion is of differing measurements depending on the level of inflation.Moreover, when this is inflated, instead of a flat, steady surface you are treated to a kind of waterbed experience. (In a moving vehicle of any kind, car or plane, this would be MOST disconcerting!) There are no compartments in the design so the air goes wherever the weight is not. We also tried to inflate the cushion all the way to avoid the problem but that makes it unusable for an airline seat which is the purpose to which we intended to use it. It may work fine if you are in a wheelchair or a seat where you aren't moving but their sales pitch is intended to make you believe that it may be used in other contexts and we would strongly dispute that claim. We rate it at Zero for their co operation and Zero for utilization for the purpose intended."
101694,0,"I am very happy with this chair, I especially like the blue cover on the seat that isnt so cold when I sit on it.

377704,2,"I have purchased, stupidly, two boxes of test strips, one after the other. Hardly any have worked. The monitor either says the strips' expiration date has passed (which it has not), or the monitor simply will not accept the lot number, which you must dial in before the test.

132014,1,If you're looking at this zinc supplement to help clear up your skin...beware. taking 3 or 4 was the most effective dose for me and that just means the bottle doesn't last very long. I wish I could get a giant bottle with quadruple dose supplements.
245563,0,"After a lot of great use, I'm ready to replace my Oral B power toothbrush with a new one -- and I'm not going to purchase this one again.Although it does a great job of cleaning teeth, the cap protecting the replacement heads broke off after just a few months of use.Plus, it takes up a lot of room and tips over quite easily, which is annoying in a busy bathroom.It's also impossible to clean. This is what's really making me choose a different type of power toothbrush. It's just so unhygenic when toothpaste, moisture and who knows what builds up in a portion of the device that is underneath where the additional toothbrush heads rest. You have to take the device apart to try to reach it, but it takes far too much time--and sponges, Q-tips and whatever else I can squeeze in there--to try to scoop it all out and make it clean. There's got to be a better alternative."

But if your looking to sculp your facial hair into a flamingo perched in a pond with kermit, well then i'de have to say look somewhere else. This one was not design with precision in mind. To elucidate it's bulking so getting into tight areas is almost impossible without bending and flexing your face everywhich way. I like it though, i use it daily to keep my sexy 5'clock shadow trimmed mess free."
393077,0,The sling worked great for a couple of weeks when my son was a newborn but he quickly outgrew it. The divider in the middle of the tub was always poking him in the back even with the straps adjusted correctly. I can't get him to fit properly in the reclined infant side (he's 4 mos) and he can't sit up in the toddler side. He's very active and his bottom won't stay in the alloted space behind the divider. He pushes his feet against the tub so that his bottom comes up and rests on the divider. That divider is always in the way. I would rather have a tub without sections.

I haven't used them in about a year, but today I decided to resume my whitening again with a new box of premium whitestrips. After about 4 minutes of wearing the strips, I experienced the WORST PAIN I EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. It felt as it the pain was coming from inside my bottom teeth, and I actually was nauseated from the pain, that's how severe it was. I immediately ripped off the strips and rinsed out my mouth, and now I'm PETRIFIED to attempt using them again. Does anyone know if this is normal? Please email me and let me know why this happened!!

99230,0,Unsure how to rate this as I don't notice any physical changes from taking it. Tastes great although I do not mix it in water as you lose too much stuck to the glass (it costs as much as silver). I put one teaspoon in my mouth and then add sips of water. No mess or lose of product.

237245,0,"Ordered 2 of these ""squeegees"" to replace 2 by InterDesign that I had had for many years and liked very much. I wonder if they really are by InterDesign. They certainly are not as nice.They don't look as sleek, and their new design does not have a big enough hole to fit onto my shower ""caddy."" (My shower walls are of travertine and suction cups don't adhere for very long.) The squeegee blade does not work as well either; not nearly as flexible.I threw away the packaging, so I don't know what it said anymore. The squeegee itself does not have a brand or any other identifier on it, but I doubt if it is really by InterDesign. If it is, they have certainly lowered their quality standards.There are so many squeegees in hardware stores and elsewhere that really don't perform very well. It matters when you have a large glass shower surround and you have water with minerals that leaves spots on the glass if you don't do a quick wipe after each shower. This new squeegee makes that much more of a chore."

It would work for wide mouth baby bottles, wine glasses, and plastic sport bottles, but I have no problem cleaning these without buying a special brush.

Turned out it was smoke.We are just thankful it didn't happen in the kids' room at night!I just did a search on this product and a couple people have had this issue--and associated it with black flakes in the water. We didn't have any water discoloration- one minute it seemed to be working fine, the next it was smoking. We have hard water--maybe going too long between cleanings caused it to burn out.Maybe we had it running for too long.Always remember to have working smoke detectors when you have a vaporizer running!"

The bunny ears still work on both, but it [...] because the orgasms are so much better when stimulated by the G-spot and clitoris...Don't get me wrong, I didn't abuse this toy! The first one I had, I probably used only 10 times...it's a grat toy - it makes you orgasm in the matter of minutes, and it feels amazing - but it's inevitable that it's going to break within a month. I think I am going to invest in a better quality one, because you won't get your money's worth out of this one!"

322903,0,"I thought I'd give this a try after having used Proraso for a while as my main shaving cream. I'd heard that Musgo Real was a good, inexpensive cream. On the positive side, it does lather easily with a brush. But in my experience I noticed I got cuts a little more frequently when using this cream than with Proraso, Omega, or Crabtree & Evelyn (my favorite so far, but more expensive). Also, I was not a fan of the scent. It wasn't bad, but I didn't like it either. It had a real cologne element to it that was quite strong and would linger for a while after shaving. It's not bad shaving cream, but I definitely prefer Proraso for the price."

It works within one day, avoiding the costly vet bills I had when they all got very sick a couple of months ago. The vet had recommended it to me and I'm so happy to find this online. I'm now giving the powder routinely to help their immune system and keep the sneezing and runny eyes/nose at bay."
315469,0,"I have owned these clothes pins for just over a year. I loved them until recently...I was hanging laundry as usual and one of the clothes pins broke. I thought it was a fluke and tossed it. However, the very next day I had 2 break and it hasn't stopped since then. I have had one to two break almost daily since. I live in California and while I keep them outside, they are not in direct sun all day. For a product that is made to be in the sun and claims ""that these do not get brittle and break like the dime store plastic pins"" I am disappointed. In my opinion they should last longer than just one year.I called the manufacturer and with little hassle they offered to send me a replacement. Unfortunately, they are only sending me a package of 12 which will only replace what has broken so far. I fear all will break soon and will have to be replaced. If my fear is realized, I will definitely be buying a different product."

190918,0,"I'm not sure if I would recommend this to anyone or not. I like the idea of preventing urinary tract infections with this product, but it's difficult to take and has some side effects. The dosage is one to four capsules at each meal -- that would be up to twelve a day, and the bottle had only 50 in it. I started out on a very low dosage, because I wasn't sure what it would do to me -- there was nothing at all on the package other than the dosage directions. This is a very powerful diuretic. From the first dosage, I found myself in the bathroom a lot. It also tended to give me diarrhea when I took a full day's dose. It seems easier to me to just drink a lot of cranberry juice if you're worried about urinary infections."

The gel you use for conductivity purposes is sticky and goopy, and the device itself is hard to hold and at higher numbers (the higher the number, the tighter the electronic muscle stimulation), the more it hurts! At lower numbers, it feels somewhat pleasant, but when you get up to 6, it really hurts, like being given an electric shock. Actually, I am thinking of sending this product back and going to a reputable plastic surgeon to see about doing something about this double chin. There might be better devices out there for this purpose, but I don't think the FS153 is one of them. Look elsewhere!"

371377,0,"The product works just fine, let me say that first. The speed dials up and down wonderfully and it feels great....however....being one for aesthetically pleasing experiences, it almost embarrasses me to be giving this as a gift. The thing looks like a cheap childs' toy. The owners manual pictures are so blurry you can't even tell what they're trying to show you, and the words both on the box, and more importantly, the ENTIRE manual are SOOOO poorly translated from whatever language they were written inoriginally that I can barely make sense out of what's being said.

The only downside, and a small one at that, was the learning curve for figuring out how to take off and replace the different heads but that's no longer a problem. Buy it, you'll like it!"
389933,0,"I have a hard time rating this objectively. I never used a pre-shave oil before so I have little to compare to. The 60ml size seems to be small for the money, but this is a good value compared to some of the other oils. A small amount works. Pour a nickle sized dollop in one palm, and rub your hands together, then rub the oil into your beard. It is better if your face is slightly wet: the oil spreads easier. I found that it creates a warming sensation, both fragrant and pleasant. I also found that if I leave this on for several minutes it tends to work better, so I'll put it on before I get coffee in the morning, then shave after.One note: Have your water running before you pour the oil. Your hands will be very sticky, but soap and water cleans this off easily.I use a very good shave soap with a Badger brush. The lather builds stronger when I use the oil, and the resultant shave seems closer, or at least more even.I don't use this every day, as it could get pricey replacing this twice a month! I started reserving it for Mondays as a treat to make Mondays less traumatic! :)"

I guess the unbleached, janitorial roll paper towels are along the same line, just thinner for toilet paper. That stuff was made for public restrooms cause of kids and people put lots of toilet paper in the potty's. Plus, the TP was unbleached, and the absolute most basic, rapid dissolving eco-friendly version toilet paper of the 1970s and 1980s."

20769,2,"I've had the Braun 8585 for four months now. The device does not age well.Despite the use of the included cleaning / charging base, two screws under the foil screen are rusting. I'm considering this a cosmetic problem until something actually falls apart.The main problem I have is with the cleaning / charging base. When I put the razor in the base, I have to jiggle it for several minutes to get the ""Charge"" light to come on or to get the base to determine a cleaning cycle to use.When I do get the base to start cleaning the razor, the razor always shakes lose during the same stage of the cleaning. At one point the razor turns on and begins running, and it's at this stage that the razor shakes itself lose and disconnects. The end result is a razor that refuses to charge in the base and isn't being cleaned.My wife managed to get it to hold still for a cleaning cycle with the careful use of a Q-tip to jam the razor against the wall of the case. This is an art I've been unable to master.While I can still charge the razor using the electrical cable, the major feature, the self cleaning functionality, is completely useless.In the end, I'm disappointed in the razor, and have no intention of purchasing a Braun razor in the future."
204099,1,Every new mom or someone who travels a lot needs one of these. This is my fourth white noise maker and it is my favorite so far. The volume go high enough to block out the outside noise. There is a variety of sounds and it comes with a adaptor. Great product!
351427,0,"I bought this without sky high expectations, and I would say I got precisely what I expected. I ordered this product hoping it would be delicious, giving me some additional variety in pre-packaged between-meals snacks. It wasn't, so I don't intend to order it again, given the better tasting alternatives available.To be fair, it's perfectly edible and obviously convenient, but actually not delicious. It delivers an appropriate 5 grams of protein in 150 calories, but disappointingly, only 3g of fiber. As another reviewer correctly pointed out, nutritionally, you're getting fiber and protein, and that's it. True enough, but 3g is barely enough. Coupled with the 5g protein, more fiber would have allowed for feeling fuller longer--one of the keys to losing weight.For the sake of comparison, I will compare this to my favorite alternative that is about the same volume of food, a Fiber One, 'oats & chocolate' bar. Both products are 40g by volume, so this is very much an apples to apples comparison. In those 40g, the Hollywood Cookie is 150 calorie vs 140 for Fiber One, a negligible difference. The one and only area of advantage for the Hollywood Cookie is the 5g of protein vs 2g for the Fiber One. But the Hollywood Cookie's 3g of fiber pales in comparison to the Fiber One, which delivers a whopping 9g of fiber! That really can help you feel fuller longer.Since I already eat adequate protein, though sometimes lack adequate fiber, the choice for me is clear, especially given the mere 3g difference in protein between the two, the far greater fiber benefit with Fiber One, and and the fact that I consider Fiber One to be absolutely delicious to the point that I prefer it to a Snickers bar, for example. Plus it's much, much less expensive. But that's just one product I compared it too. I'm sure there are many more examples such as Oh Yea bars, Promax, Clif Bars, all of which, to me, taste better.In short, perhaps the ""Hollywood Cookie"" is only recommended for people who are deficient in protein, for whom every 3g extra makes a big difference, or those who may actually like it's odd taste. To be honest, I struggled to give this 3 stars, given the above comparison and it's high cost. The Hollywood Cookie diet, to me, just isn't worth it. It's not good enough compared to the competition."
79246,0,"Way 2 expensive at $66. Optimum has good protein, I myself have (my 4th 5lb purchase) Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound and it's $45. The ""natural"" label isn't worth it."
234352,0,"I like the natural deodorant, my favorite part is that it's free of aluminum. The only thing I don't like about this stick is that you have to get it wet first. While that is all well and good, if you get it too wet, it drips down your torso while it's drying. Plus, if you get it too wet, you have to shake some of the water off in the sink, which leaves a film on the sink. Yes, it washes off, but it's annoying.I personally prefer the roll on one. It works exactly the same, but no film in the sink, and no water dripping down your body. I found that after the first few weeks I stopped sweating as much, due to my body figuring out that it didn't have to compensate for an antiperspirant. It lasts most of the day, by the evening it's pretty much worn off, but that works for me because I'm usually at home by then. Also, if you go swimming, it will come off. I realize that this seems intuitive, but some regular deodorants don't and I thought I would warn those people who didn't realize this would happen."

These are all delicious flavors that I can handle in large quantities (as you get when buying 5lbs of the stuff). Bottom line - this stuff tastes great for a great price and will help you reach your fitness goals if used with proper diet and lifting."

232917,0,Overall I like this product. The cover for the brush and replacable heads in the storage base is a nice touch. Older models tended to collect dust and debries because the top was open. I would have rated this higher but I don't care for the way the charger plug mounts in the storage base. It seems a bit on the flimsy side and I'm not sure of the long term durability and reliability of the connection.

Tired of just 'covering up' this stinky air with air fresheners, etc., i decided to give this product a try based on what it claimed as well as the user reviews.After using it for a few days, my verdict is - it's OK. Not great, not terrible, but OK. I don't know if its worth the $60 price tag, to tell you the truth (plus the cost of the scents going forward). It's kinda loud, and the whole glowing blue light thing is just kinda weird. (You can turn off the lights that glow into the water, but the main light stays on regardless). On the bright side, it does make the air smell better while it is on, but with its whirring motor and alien glow, you definitely know its in the room."

226239,0,"I should give this product four stars: it works quickly and efficiently at removing back hair. The item is lightweight and easy to maneuver but keep in mind if you are going to shave your back by yourself you really do need a 3 way mirror to see what you are doing. That said the item I received had a broken part inside the handle which rattled loudly. I had to take the thing apart to see what piece had broken off inside. Luckily the broken piece did not effect the performance of the unit. I couldn't determine what it was anyway. Although lightweight, the ManGroomer is made of VERY cheap plastic: if you drop this thing on a hard surface I'm afraid it would crack or break. For $40, I wish it had been made of sturdier material. Also it does not come with a cap to protect the blade assembly. All-in-all I'm pleased with this product and do recommend it since it is really the only product of its kind I have seen."

Just get a decent brush (don't spend too much on it - I spent $3.50 on a boar hair brush) and you're good to go. If you get the amount of water just right you'll find that the lather is better than any of the regular shave creams or foams or gels you can get down at the drug store. Plus, this doesn't have as much impact on the environment. I'm sick to death of plastic packages and cans of shave cream that don't always get recycled. This tub of soap comes in a little plastic container but lasts forever and you can recycle it at the end. I do wish it came in a paper or metal or glass container.

76792,2,"This product is awesome in terms of doing what it is designed to do.The real problem is whether/how it works when you travel outside of the US. I travel overseas a lot and really need a white noise machine in busy city hotels. I have had two of these units literally explode after a few minutes of being plugged in (once in Germany, the other in China). In both cases I was using a travel adapter that all my other appliances work with.There are no warnings/instructions or guidance of any kind about voltage / currents / using while traveling. There is some cryptic note that talks about this being ""polarized like a table lamp"" which means absolutely nothing to me and certainly doesn't help re: travelSuch a shame that a good product made in the USA has incomplete documentation that doesn't think beyond our borders."
182252,2,"These things rarely stay on, and even when they do, once the pee stream starts, it pushes the teepee right off anyways. Unless your baby is motionless, or is a weak uninator, then don't even bother with these. You're better off just putting a dry wipe on your boy's junk to deflect the stream and soak up the pee."

70901,0,"This is a very elegant looking shave, but it doesn't excel. I have to shave over and over to get certain spots, and I get shaver burn. It isn't awful, but I just don't get a great shave with this thing. I'm going to try something else."
226428,0,"It absolutely removes the hair and in places that are impossible to reach without someone else to help, so it's less embarassing. It is not a clean shave, though, so while it improves back hair problems, it does not eliminate them. It is cheaply constructed, which is concerning. It sucks batteries very quickly."
163216,1,"i highly recommend this for anyone who is considering purchasing the diva cup. i have heard there are many other cups to choose from on the market, and i have not tried them, but the diva cup is a wonderful alternative to all of the disposable products out there on the market. not to mention, it is so much better for your body, as tampons are made out of rayon and soaked in bleach. these are NOT good things to put inside your body. the diva cup is also much more convenient and economical. you can forget about those emergency trips to the store, or the uh oh.... my tampon is leaking and i just used my last one! all in all, i would say the biggest hurdle is learning how to use it correctly. however, there is a fantastic online blog(on livejournal) that answers endless questions about anything you would need to know, and they can help you use it correctly."

342168,0,"I AM EDITING THE REVIEW BELOW FOR AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. THE REVIEW STILL STANDS AS THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT BUT SOMEONE MUST HAVE GONE MAD! I PURCHASED THE TRIMMER FOR $17.95 IN MAY 2009 AND IT IS NOW SELLING FOR ALMOST $60. THERE ARE OTHER SIMILAR CONAIR MODELS STILL AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE... THIS ONE IS VERY OVERPRICED AT THE NEW PRICEThis is a compact trimmer that combines enough power with a small enough cutting area to get into tight spots around the nose. I travels well if you just take the trimmer accessories you need with you and leave the ones you seldom use at home. I retired a bulkier model for this one and am pleased with the change. In addition to being very portable and versatile, it is also a great value."

420857,0,"lol. Just have a Rembrandt 5 second fail. In order to mold trays I ran plain water through my Keurig (says to use water the temperature of coffee..) Dropped the trays in and walked to the couch to mold them. Well in the 5 seconds from the couch to the living room (probably 3.5 seconds), the trays had melted into balls. Now I am stuch with ten little tubes of tis stuf but my kids have two new superballs to play with. Watch the trays!"

407731,1,"I have used The Doctor's Nightguard appliance before and it was fine! You put it in boiling water to soften it, then dip it in cold water for just a second to remove the surface hot water then put it in your mouth and press it with fingers to fit while SUCKING with your tongue pressed forward. You must HOLD that for about 1 minute.But, hey... for about 5 years now I've bought similar appliances at Target/Walmart/K-mart stores for about $1.00 (yes, ONE dollar) in the sports section of the store. They're intended for football players to wear (and maybe prize fighters?). You fit them exactly the same way as the Dr.'s Mouth Guard, and they cushion your teetch and prevent the upper and lower teeth from grinding against each other.At first it was uncomfortable, but I took a good pair of strong scissors and trimmed it to fit great! It ""pops"" in, fits snugly, doesn't fall out. It's FINE!And if you have dental work done, like a new crown, you can re-shape or remold it again just as you did when it was new... or hell, just go spend one buck and buy a new one."
259179,0,"I have had the Germ Terminator for a little over a month now. I used it regularly for my normal toothbrushes and it worked GREAT! I recently purchased an electronic Sonicare Toothbrush and read in the Terminator instructions and descriptors that it works on the electric toothbrush heads as well. Which is the reason I purchased the Germ Terminator in the first place, because it could work with both. However, I don't know how true that is. I put my brand new Sonicare Toothbrush head in the Germ Terminator and left it overnight... I woke up to a melted toothbrush head. So--- I would say that it shouldn't be used with electric toothbrush heads. I don't know if it is because I left it overnight (about 6 hours), but I have always done that with my other toothbrushes with no issues. So unfortunately, I don't use it anymore. I'm trying to find other uses for it.But for regular toothbrushes, the unit works awesome!!!! For electric toothbrush heads... BE CAREFUL!"
311191,0,"Just for those of you who are concerned about their general health, I found out this product contained soybean oil by reading the label (probably transgenic soybean since 85% of soybean crops in the US are transgenic). I wish they had used a different oil like coconut or something."
66462,0,"To save fuel cost I turned the heat down in my house and put heating pads in strategic locations. I already have some older cheaper heating pads but was not very happy with them because they have hot spots.Happily, this sunbeam heats evenly with no hot spots. However, even at the lowest setting it still gets too warm for my taste. The temperature doesn't change enough between the lowest setting and the highest. Because of this I usually set it at the low setting.The pad doesn't come with a cover because the entire pad is washable. However I still prefer to have a cover. Washing an electrical appliance just doesn't feel right.As for the controller/switch, so far it has worked ok, albeit a little sluggish if I try to quickly go from low to high (always power up at low). The LCD display lights up for a few seconds only when the switches are touched. This is silly; the light uses very little power. There is no need to turn off the light while the pad is on. Anyway, when the room is dark, I cannot tell if it's on or off at a glance. Fortunately it has a 2-hour timer, so if I left it on by chance, it would turn off in 2 hours.The feel of the pad itself is nice and soft. Unlike my old ones with vinyl surface which feel cold and stiff when off and soft only when on.It drains a tiny amount of electricity when off and plugged in. This goes against the green movement. A better design would add a mechanical switch so that when it is off, it uses no electricity.Pros: no hot spots; heats up evenly; soft to the touch; washableCons: even at the lowest setting it could be too warm-------- added on 5/7/2010 --------The controller is showing signs of failure -- sometimes I have to press it several times to get the desired response. Today is the worst -- I have to press ON about a dozen times before it turns on. The product is less than 1 year old."

69402,0,"This is overrated, but as always I will give it a fair rating.The mug has seams from when it was manufactured via injection mold.It doesn't hold heat as well as ceramic bowls and mugs. It doesn't clean up as easily as a ceramic mug.But if you want rubber instead of ceramic, then this might be the for you. It is perfectly functional, and, on the plus side, was made in Minnesota, United States."
373033,0,"From the reviews I had high hopes for these scissors. The finger holes are a good size for a man's hands but if you have more than a few hairs to trim the scissors balk at cutting, just bending the hairs instead. So it's kind of slow going. Wish they were a little more substantial or maybe it's the sharpness that's the problem."
131183,2,"I bought one of these from Wal-Mart online because it was only $99.00 ($149.99 at Amazon). It was great for a while, a powerful deep-tissue massage. However this only lasted about 2 weeks before one of the controls stopped functioning. I sent it back and received a replacement within 10 days. This one did not turn on at all... absolutely no response whatsoever... so back it goes too. I will not be replacing the unit. Pretty poor when the unit fails straight from the box. Don't they do any quality control whatsoever?"
134702,2,"This is the third WaterPik we purchased over the past several years. Each time the hose got brittle and broke into several pieces within a couple of years. Also, customer service is not willing to help with replacements. We will definitely try another brand."
360770,0,"I bought size medium, and that is the size I have worn in another brand which fit well, but these did not fit well. They were too short, always sliding off my pregnant belly. I spent the whole day pulling them up! They were also very tight, very hard to get on, which is good to a point, but these were just ridiculous. I do like that they are more sheer than other brands I have worn. They are like regular panty hose. The color is great. They are not as ugly as my other pair in another brand."
193760,1,This is not the reason I'm taking this supplement. I take this along with a multivitamin and an omega supplement as a daily routine. I usually take one towards the evening and it has a calming effect and really helps me sleep. I'm much more refreshed in the morning if I remember to take this at night. This is probably do to the magnesium content in this supplement which is considered to be a anti-stress mineral. Taking this along with the other supplements has really helped with my weight loss.
254166,0,"I dreamt of the day I'd finally own a Hitachi since I purchased my first vibrator! So needless to say, I was excited as heck when it finally arrived. The vibrations are I N T E N S E. And that's how I like them! Definitely harder than any toy I've owned in the past!HOWEVER.When people say it's loud, they mean LOUD! Not the kind of loud where I can muffle it under a thick comforter; I have to wrap it up in a blanket and stick that under a pillow & ride on top just to be able to use it! Which feels great, yeah, but it's SO inconvenient when after a long, hard day I just want to lay in bed & relax.Also, lets talk about the shape. The head is perfect for its SUPPOSED purpose (""body massager"") but when it comes to sexual stimulation, the vibrations are spread over a surface area the size of a baseball. I find myself having to press hard on the head to get the concentration I enjoy.It's definitely pleasurable, and maybe I'd enjoy it more if I didn't share a house with my family ;P but the volume & size are just too much for me to truly enjoy it. I do recommend ladies try riding it under some layers, though! Definitely fun!If you want some hard, CONCENTRATED vibrations, the Jopen has a line of vibes that pack a serious punch without ANY of the noise."
73084,0,"Originaly I ordered a box with 6 of this cleaning solution back in September. Amazon said it would not be available until January 2007. I needed this solution for my shaver. So I ordered to 2 pack instead. Well upon going through the misleading amazon interface, I was under the impression that if I order $25 or more I get free shipping. So I order this solution and some neutrogena aftershave cream. As a result, i ended up buying these 2 products from 2 different vendors, so I ended up paying $5+ extra for each shipping!"
184762,0,"These things are very cute as a novelty item. At first I thought that was all they were good for. They do not stay on unless you hold it on, which is too hard when changing a diaper. I did find out that they do work great once the baby has started peeing. I keep them right next to his changing pad and if he happens to stream, I put one on right away and hold it there. It soaks up the pee and prevents an even bigger mess from being made. They're very absorbent and I do like that I have them, but with little boys, some pee escaping seems to be unavoidable."

268342,0,this toothbrush is great. Baby loves it and it really relieves his itching gums. But it is tiny very tiny it could have a longer handle. and also the materials atracts lint so you have to definatly pay attention while baby is using it. you dont want him to suck on a hairball yuks!.

371604,0,"I and my family loved this product. Over the years I have bought seven of them and given some as gifts. Now they have ""improved"" the replacement brushes. The original brush they called ""Cyberspring"" (part number C239). They said it was patented and all that. It had a little spring at the base of each set of bristles. The new brushes (including Cybersonic 3)no longer have these springs and they last about 1/4 as long as the original brush and turn all fuzzy right away. I doubt that I will buy anymore Cybersonic products. Too bad, the shortsighted bean counters screwed up another good product."
52649,0,"My Sonicare Elite lasted 2 or 3 years. The cover came off of the on/off switch. That means that water can get in and ruin the electronics. It hasn't failed yet only because I stopped using it. I contacted Phillips support on line chat. Nice people, but no offer to replace the unit. Obviously it is out of warranty, but this type of failure should not happen until past 5 years. [...]Please note that Sonicare will protect your teeth and it is money well spent."
362072,0,"Like many MADE IN CHINA products, there is a small plastic strip that must be removed before use. This is the piece that protects the batteries from draining during shipping due to accidentally being turned on - it breaks the connection. I pulled out this strip, (it was stubborn - so I probably ripped it out, leaving the piece that goes between the battery and the metal contact - I turned the unit on, nothing. No light. Now the magnifying glass is nice. The China thing bothers me - but what isn't made in China? Unfortunate. But the glass magnifies. It does what it is supposed to do - make stuff look bigger. The handle is 3 position. No probs there. But the dern light - I sent it back, and re-ordered another. Amazon service was simple. Put in same box, print a label, chuck into mailbox, wait a few days. New one appears. That's great. Better than e_Bayyy would be! Will update when new one arrives.UPDATE: Amazon was right there to make things right, as usual. Seamless replacement. A few clicks, another one was on its' way, arrived a couple of days later, worked fine. I gave it as a gift to my aging relatives, so I can't speak to how long the LED will or did last, as I don't want to ask about a gift. It'sas if I'm reminding them I gave a gift - - as in -- "" So, how's the magnifying glass (that I GAVE YOU AS A GIFT) working out? Is the light OK - because people on AMAZON wanna know"".mmmmmm no. Not nice. Calling attention to a gift. Not cool.See what I mean ??? Well, no, how could you? --- If you did, you wouldn't be ordering a magnifying glass, LOL.Sorry Amazonians, I took this as far as I could. And got a chuckle out of it. Such ah deal !OUT"
372054,0,"I initially found the core flex at the Sharper Image for much more money. Amazon had it for much less and with free shipping, so why not.

Don't look foward to awesome abs anytime soon."

Energy wise didn't give me much energy, but then again my body is use to supplements , but if this is your first time taken a pre workout pill supplement this is not a bad start. overall a ok product, doesn't live up to the little good reviews i read! not much energy, good pumps not great but a good price.

208032,0,"I got these as a replacement for a full boot sleep brace to help me battle my plantar fasciitis. My initial impression was quite positive:1) this allowed for an active (and adjustable) all night stretch2) way more comfortable to sleep in than the boot3) woke up with less heel pain4) Easy to travel withIt's been 6 months since I started using this product and I now have the following updates:1) the material stretches out over time so you will need to keep shortening the velcro (I'm onto the very last inch of it now, so soon this won't be effective at all).2) I find that my body sometimes tries to push back against the sock while I'm asleep, as since the material has give when force is applied this means I can wake up finding that my calves are cramped from pushing down all night long (as if pushing on a gas pedal - perhaps this speeded up issue #1 above).3) The extra pull up on my toes took a long time to get used to, and it can occasionally keep me up.4) The worst offense of all - I can wake up with such extreme big-toe-nail-pain. Like stabbing pain, caused by the compression on the big toe from the upward pull. This has caused me to rip off the strassburg sock in the middle of the night,which leaves me without the needed assistance for my plantar fasciitis.Overall this is worth a shot IF you are struggling to sleep in your boot. If the boot works good for you than stick with it!My experiences may be different than yours with regard to my drawbacks, but I am actively looking for alternatives that work since this is just no longer functional for me."

266283,0,"I think it's important to note it is more likely you may be allergic to this than other supplements.

If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking dandelion.&#34;Having seasonal allergies, and having taken this for 3 days, I unfortunately think I am one of those sensitive people so I can't comment on the effectiveness of this product as I have stopped using it. I can however note that sometimes when taking the pill there is a floral taste - a taste like you got too close to the flowers you were smelling. It's not bitter though and goes away within a few minutes."
285096,0,"I like everything about this product except for the taste. It seems that the manufacturers were trying to overpower the beeswax smell/flavor with something else, which was a mistake because what they used to mask it was much, much worse. It would have been better if left alone.I like the subtle color of the product and the smoothing job it does on my lips. It tends to stay on for at least three hours, so if I didn't have such a visceral reaction to the way it tastes I would be able to give it five stars."
96178,0,"This product is ok, the shave is not as closed as I would like it to be, but for the price it gets the job done. Its silver blade give a more effective shave than the golden T-outliner blade.

I really like the molded teeth trays that mold perfectly to your teeth for better contact and therefore better whitening abilityYou warm up water and dip each tooth mold into the warm water briefly and then using your tongue and lips (and fingers a little bit) mold it onto your teeth and let it set up.Take out a vial and snip off the top and evenly squirt into one of the molds, then repeat with another vial and the other moldInsert the molds into your mouth and begin timing for 20 minutes.Remove and rinse your mouth and moldWait 10 minutesRepeat the process three more timesYour done.I did not like the goop. And you use an entire vial on the upper and another on the lower.

I have to loosen it first (which is also difficult), but that risks a big spill if mishandled. At least the dispensing hole is bigger than some others (but it could be an issue for the largest pills out there, which I don't need). They probably should make several different size holes.From the looks of it, I wouldn't count on the plastic hole cover lasting very long from regular flexing (that's a problem for any plastic joint), which may or may not be important to some."

Without standardization you couldn't ingest the correct volume of the dried Ginkgo leaves, and you would be more prone to allergic or toxic reactions which the standardization process in this case corrects reliably.40-80 mg. about 3 times a day as part of your herbal regime is about the usually dose according to Dr. James Duke's, ""Herbal Handbook"".ABOUT BRANDS: SWANSON IS A BEST BUY - VITAMIN SHOPPE - NOW & NATURE'S WAY ARE TOP QUALITY TOO!This particular 'Vitamin Shoppe' brand product has been on my shelf, though it is not right now. The results here are roughly equivalent to the results I experienced from the 'Nature's Way', 'Swanson' and 'Now' Brands which I also highly regard. Also bear in mind, that this Vitamin Shoppe product has twice the standardized extract, 120 mg., than the others mentioned here. Still, the difference here in these similarly standardized Ginko products boils down to the price, even after factoring in the double dose for Vitamin Shoppe. You see, the Swanson standardized Ginkgo is 60 mg. in each of the 240 capsules, std. for 24% flavone glycosides, and 6% terpene lactones is roughly half the price of the brands I named per volume of product from discount vendors also available here.

187169,0,"We had need for a walker for a short time at our house. The hospital provided an Invacare walker, which our insurance would pay for. The Invacare walker has a different front profile from most, so I could not just buy a one-size-fits-most generic basket. This basket fits the Invacare walker fine, but it only comes in the open basket style shown. Knowing what we now know, I'd prefer to be able to use one of those canvas/nylon baskets so small articles don't fall out, and the world doesn't see what is in your basket. But this Invacare basket fits snugly, so we used it.Would not recommend the walker or the basket, for the reasons mentioned. But it works ok. I would not choose this brand if I had to use a walker for a long time.Shipper was fast, and packed it beautifully. The fault is in the walker itself."
135639,2,"This foot bath will probably give you stress rather than relax your feet. As mentioned by other reviewers, it does not warm water at all. You have to add the warm water. While the product claims to keep said warm water warm for a while, it will get cold within 5 minutes. Honestly, I think the machine cools the water. There are no moving parts, so to use all the attachments you have to move your foot over them. Another problem I've found is the particularly low maximum water level which leaves half my foot out of the foot bath. Even when you don't exceed the max water level line, a lot of the water is thrown out when using the bubbles function. As was also mentioned by other reviewers, the water jets are practically useless. The water is thrown at your ankles and I wouldn't use ""jet"" as a way to describe it... it is more like a water stream. Obviously, I was disappointed by this product."

375238,0,"So before I bought this, I read most of the reviews. the good and bad. I also did my research on youtube! This product in particular, is as noisy as any other electronic shavers. It can be a little messy and it is best used in the bathroom, over the sink or bathtub. It is NOT cordless, and DOES NOT operate on batteries. which is probably better. That way, you know you have no chance of shaving half way and running out to buy batteries!In terms of the pain tolerance, it is probably best if you tried it on your legs where it is not as painful as your underarms. It does not do the greatest job if you're comparing this to waxing. you will have to use a tweezer here and there for the smaller hairs. It can be a pain to clean the hairs out. The product comes with a small brush that you can use to brush out the smaller hairs that are stuck in the shaver. it comes off in 3 parts, making it a little easier to clean.what the epilator actually looks like is a shaver with no blades, but to replace it, is a bunch of small tweezers that pulls your hair from the roots. so is it painful? of course it is. just like waxing! does it gives you the smooth effect if you're comparing it to waxing? No.If you're asking for smooth hairless legs and underarms, stick with waxing. But if you just need it to groom yourself for casual outings, this would do the trick.your skin will get irritated a little after using it so make sure you apply lotion after you're done."

If you don't need one to cover as much area as this one, consider buying one a bit smaller. I am going to get a smaller one and retire this one, as it takes up a lot of room in the freezer and is pretty heavy when placed on my hip. I do very much like the blue plastic one--it seems very durable and I'm glad I bought it rather than the cheaper black one. The price here on Amazon is so much more reasonable than trying to get one of these in a medical supply shop, believe me. I am glad I bought it however, and I think others will be as well, as it provides wonderfu cooling relief to in flamed areas without freezing them."

20867,0,"I got this shaver kit in November 2004 (it's now August 2005), and while the shaver has always performed quite nicely once I got used to it (I previously shaved with blades), the cleaning unit has always been kind of a pain. It's rather noisy to begin with, although that may be almost inevitable. Second, the 'three cleaning programs' that are advertised are all automatic--it chooses which one it thinks needs to be done, and the 'intensive' cleaning uses up a *lot* of fluid. The fluid cartridges have lasted me about six to eight weeks each, and I clean the shaver almost every day.The unfortunate thing is that now the cleaning unit has now ceased to clean, although it still charges the shaver. It started making funnier and funnier noises (different from the normal buzzing noise cycle it goes through) over the last few weeks and finally it just stuck in one particular noise for a long time (more than 20 minutes), and I finally shut it off. It was full of hair clippings and cleaning fluid, and once I wiped it out and tried to restart it, nothing happens. Nothing. So now I have a nice charging stand, but no cleaning.So, in summary, nice shaver, but unfortunately flimsy and cheap cleaning unit. Therefore... three stars from me."

51718,0,"I researched this product thoroughly and decided to buy it based on other peoples reviews. Most said it hurts, but it's bearable. Well, not for me! I have never been a waxer - always shaved - so I expected it to hurt.. but OMG!! I popped some pain pills, and went at it. No matter if I used the massaging head, soft setting, experienced head or the optimal setting, I just couldn't bare the pain! I could feel each and every hair pulling out and it felt like someone was stabbing me! But, I did both legs until it wouldn't pull anymore hairs, and they were still left prickly, sore, and swollen. I tried again the next day and decided it's not for me. I have really dark, thick hairs on my legs, so maybe I just have more rooted hairs than most women. The machine does work as it should and is well made. The foil-shaving attachment is nice too because it gets as close to the skin as using a razor would. I had no problem with the Silk-epil's performance, it's just that epilation is not for me."

94913,0,"Ah-h-h the good old FDA ... always looking out for the people. As long as those people are themselves or the elitist chemical/pharmaceutical companies that promise to line their pockets if they will approve a new, much-cheaper, synthetic replacement ingredient ""deemed safe"" by their own conclusive, in-depth (and unavailable to the public) study. And we wonder why chronic disease, LD's and Alzheimer's are so epidemic here.Is this product natural? No. But are its ingredients more natural than what is allowed here in the US? Of course! It seems that Shark Liver Oil and live cell derivative yeast are effective ingredients, they're just more expensive and therefore less profitable than their not-so-effective, unsafe synthetic alternatives. So, with that in mind, I do appreciate the fact that Canada has stuck to their guns and not been (so far) bought out by the pharmaceutical elitists' ploys in this instance, unlike our own corrupt government agencies.That being said, however, this product, which contains petrolatum and sodium laurel sulfate, is still far from ""natural."" This may explain why my rosacea was not at all happy with its application, though I must confess that it does work to combat puffiness. Give it a go, if you like. Just recognize that it is hardly ""natural."""

333397,0,"I have been a long time blade shaver - most recently with the Mach3. I thought I would give this electric a try because of the ability to shave wet. I've been using it about 3 wks now, so here are my general thoughts. Positives: Very nice design - its very lightweight and comfortable; great to be able to use it like a manual razor - wet with shaving creme; no razor burn, or irritation. Negatives: The it's high pitched whine is a bit annoying first thing in the morning; elaborate cleaning system probably unnecessary (just rince with tap water).Now for the bottom line: does it shave as close as a blade? The answer for me is no. Today, I tried shaving one side with the Mach3 and the other with the Panasonic. It was close, but the razor clearly shaved closer with less visible stubble.The funny thing is I went over the Panasonic side with a 10 yr. old Norelco rotary (seldom used) and it was able to catch those left-over hairs below the surface! Afterward, there was almost no difference with the razor side. I guess the foil razor is just not as good for me. I think I'm going to stick with the Mach3, or perhaps try a newer Norelco with wet shave ability."

It does shave closely/well...which is the primary objective.However, there are some downsides I've found in the year+ of ownership:1) Very loud cleaning cycle! I have to do it early evening, because if I do it at night or in the morning, it keeps my wife awake (even with the door closed) and the dog also paces/whines.2) Expensive Clean/Renew cartridges. You go through one about every month-6 weeks and at $6+/each, ...3) Lately, the shaver just shuts off mid-shave after about 5 minutes, despite a full charge, fresh clean/renew cycle and a new cutter/foil head. Very frustrating.4) Some of the silver paint near the shaver head has been flaking off. Wonder if it's from the clean/renew formulation.5) The pop out clipper head (as of 2 days ago) doesn't pop back in and refuses to seat back into the shaver body, so I have to hold it closed while I shave."

Either they never tested themselves pouring out of their bottles (which is bad), or they did test and know that a pipette or big syringe is required to get the liquid out of the bottle (which is bad, too, esp. without mentioning that they use bottles without any pouring facilitator). That's additional material organizing/ ordering = time and money investment which nullifies the good price! Halaleveryday, please provide bottles with some kind of dripper!

Thanks!As a site note, I ordered this oil here (ASIN B00028MKRQ as seen in the link in the address bar), but on the invoice from Halaleveryday it says ASIN B003B8VEN0 (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003B8VEN0). It also leads me to the ""other"" oil when I click onto ""Feedback"". I still decided to comment here because in the list of merchants for B003B8VEN0 Halaleveryday does not even show up .. Amazon surveillance, please also look into this - thanks.All together incl. the product confusion only 3 stars, otherwise four or maybe even five."
321117,0,I was excited to sign up for the subscribe and save option after buying fresh Double Fudge bars at an out-of-state retailer. The best buy date on those bars was 2/17/2012 and they were soft and fresh and delicious! The box of bars I just received has a best buy date of 10/4/11 and they are firm and chalky.

264007,1,I've used it after my last three runs and my legs seem to heal up an insane amount faster than they did with just gatorade. I was having real problems getting back out there after my long runs and this has pretty much made that issue go away.
163102,0,"This thing works WONDERFULLY when ""correctly"" inserted. If it leaks, you don't have it inserted properly. It is difficult to know when it IS inserted correctly, though. It is very difficult to insert, fairly easy to remove.I also recommend ordering a larger size based upon whether or not one has ever given birth. If you've never given birth, I recommend going with the smaller size, regardless of your age.I've read many reviews from women in their 30's and older who ordered the larger size and it was too big and uncomfortable. I'm 43 and the smaller size fits great."
339045,0,"My daughter has suffered from severe boughts of colic. A friend suggested we use this product as it seemed to help their son, so my husband and I went out and got this immediately. We noticed that, while it did help somewhat,she still had horrible boughts of pain and crying even when we had given her the medicine. Plus, it was hard to get her to take it since it has to be refridgerated. So we were trying to get her to take what seemed like a whole lot of liquid (4 ml or something like that)that was very cold...she wouldn't take the bottles with the medicine in it. It did help her sleep better...but in the thick of her colicky throes--it fell flat."

But, they put them in new packaging (fine, who cares, right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them. They're sickly sweet now, they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a ""chip"" in sight.It's all bad. I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast. No more. The new ones are so bad, I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
196754,1,Amazing lil machine. I highly recommend to all females. I've been using my Lady Comp for 8 months now. My husband loves to see those green lights and I love not having to take anything hormonal and I don't have to deal with any side effects. It doesn't take long before taking your temp each morning becomes second nature and you don't even have to think about it anymore. I feel more in control of my fertility now that I am able to track my cycle. I didnt trust myself to do the charting method since my periods are so irregular but the LadyComp knows how to make those adjustments.

This pair came promptly and was packaged well (but the packaging was different from any other Rubis tweezer I've purchased). However, these don't work that well out of the package. Usually, Rubis tweezers are fantastic out of the package and over months and months become dull. These seem dull and really don't grip well like other Rubis tweezers. I guess I should have know better--these were $20 something dollars rather than $30 something dollars . . . ."

It did reduce my appetite but I felt an empty feeling between meal, so I was still thinking about food. I had a fight a bit not to eat snack. As for Hoodia Hoodia, I take only 1 (400mg) before meal and it actually makes me feel FULL after eating a very small portion. I also don't think about food as often between meal."

They provide allot more compression than regular knee highs, but don't look like anything different with slacks and dress shoes. They have helped me to fully rid myself of the swelling I was experiencing due to prolonged standing at work. My treatment regimen consisted of wearing these at work daily and drinking a glass of dandelion root tea, it's worked wonders and no pharmaceuticals needed!!"

19446,0,"As a person who needs to wear a knee brace on an everyday- all day basis, I found one important fault with this brace. The back of the brace has some sort of mesh material that is abrasive on the back of the leg right at the bending position and makes it uncomfortable to wear. When you first put the brace on, it feels good. After wearing it for about an hour, you feel the mesh cutting in to the back of the knee and it hurts. I then have to place a tissue inside the brace to block the mesh from the back of the leg and that is not an easy thing to do. Also the top of the brace tends to fold over.I actually like the way the rest of the brace is structured and hope that eventually the mesh softens enough for everyday wear. I think that the description should state that the mesh exists and maybe even why they chose to add it to the product."
121271,0,but am looking for another type of toothbrush. This was to replace a &#34;quad pacer&#34; which had a 30 second timer. This one doesn't have the timer and I miss it. Otherwise it does the job.

288620,1,I'm very happy with this battery organizer. It's just what I needed and the price was right.
170653,1,"I've tried lots of protein bars and the Chocolate Deluxe Pure protein bar is one of my all-time favorites. It is low in net carbs, high in protein and has a deep, rich, genuine chocolate flavor. I actually prefer this bar to most sugary, calorie-laden candy bars and chocolates. The Amazon price is quite reasonable--less than $2 per bar--I've paid nearly $3 at the nutrition store. The 2.75 oz bars are quite large and filling. You could just eat half and easily be satisfied. I've tried most of the other flavors (peanut marshmallow, chocolate peanut butter, strawberry, blueberry, smore's) and was never disappointed. The strawberry and blueberry have a white coating and have a softer texture. Chocolate Deluxe (which has a more solid, substantial texture and a dark chocolate coating), is my favorite, however, and really lives up to its name."
45231,0,I read this helped in an article and gave it a try. I received as advertsied and took the entire bottle (not at one time;). I noticed no positive or negative effects. I would not buy again only because it did nothing for me.
320761,0,This didn't really make me feel any better after taking for 4 weeks. I'm not sure if it's the potency or dosage or what.
358527,0,"This is a great little shaver for commuting, to keep in your briefcase, or to leave at the office. It doesn't have the oomph nor the really nice sideburn trimmer that would make it a good choice for daily chopping of a heavy beard. It does have one noticeable flaw: sometimes the battery cover comes off in a suitcase or briefcase, dumping the AA batteries out. Most inconvenient.But it's certainly worth the price and maybe a good bit more than that just to have a shaver at the office to get a quick trim before going out or before an important meeting."
50307,0,"For the price, it isn't very big. Otherwise, its a cleaning caddy ~ not much else to say there."
396809,0,"I sweat... a lot. This product serves me well on days when it is not too terribly hot and I am not too terribly active. Otherwise, it's nothing to write home about. It's better than regular antiperspirant, but still not as great as you might be hoping for."
366310,0,"Works fairly good ,just doesnt fit chairs without some kind of lower material support,if there is no lower cross bar or solid material,it slips through the open space thus defeating the purpose of back lumbar support...."
38579,0,"The product is good yes, but you still need to use some elbow grease even after applying the product for days on glass doors/windowsThe previous tenants of our apartment were not very clean so the shower window and doors (glass) were stained VERY bad. After a few weeks of using this product I was able to remove most of the stains but it's just not good enough to remove everything 100%I guess it did kill all the germs but I need something stronger for those glass stains (hmmm... maybe acid? lol)"

304281,0,"Purchased this shaver to replace a tri-head Norelco. The syncro clearning system does a wondrous job--I only use it once a week. However, periodically it WILL leave a dark residue on the screen. Therefore, don't be agape if you notice black smudge marks on your face. Albeit long on battery life, the razor has a difficult time snipping fine hairs (as opposed to stout and thick) as well as hairs along the middle to lower neck. You really have to stretch the skin to get the razor to shave such hairs--even then, it's not always successful. The so-called lock button on the on/off switch does NOT work. Meaning, while you're shaving, if your finger touches the on/off switch, it will move to the next level. Finally, after merely 5-weeks of usage, the original screen acquired a large hole. I contacted Braun, which amiably sent me a new one with cutters. Do not use pre-electric lotion on your face. This will denigrate the life of the screen. Use a bit of baby oil dabbed on the screen. Finally, the on/off switch is in a terrible location. Your thumb always hits it, thereby switching it to another level of shave. If the auto-lock mechanism actually worked, then there would be no problems. But it doesn't--it's basically useless. It's a better improvement than Norelco, but, shavers still have a ways to catch up to the razor."
90056,0,"Works like the originals. One thing I miss is the original had a usage gauge on the cover or top of the brick, it showed how much usage was still available. Now I've written a date on the brick and change them every 90 days or so. I doubt they really need replacing this often. I would use the old one with the gauge for 10 months."

It is now at the point where it will absolutely not turn on, so what I do is set it up, plug it in and sometime during the night it will start. The ""mist"" is perfect and it is great with the lavender oil I use, but I suspect sometime very soon, it will not turn on at all and I will be looking for another option."
22543,0,"I had trouble using this themometer because my child's pacifier was a different shape than this one-- so he didn't really want to suck on it long enough to get a good reading. The couple of times he was able to suck on it long enough, the reading seemed fairly accurate.Overall it is a fantastic idea-- and fairly inexpensive. So it is probably worth trying on your child."

After I soldered it into the PWB (there's no simple way to open the circuit during this procedure) some parts on the PWB (a choke and an IC) became very hot in a second. The battery itself also started warming up, which indicated a short-circuit to me. To make the long story short, I found that the battery leads were oriented so that the polarity was reversed if installed as a drop-in replacement. I had to un-solder it, flip it over, make leads extensions and solder it again. After re-charging the battery everything worked as intended, to my surprise and satisfaction.I have no clue how in the wold the circuitry has survived the reversed for ~ 5 mins. polarity..."

It would also be able to grip bigger stuff.Otherwise - the arms adjust well, stay put while in use and the magnification is sufficient for the size of the unit."
313914,0,We started using the product liked it very much seeing the fact the baby was happy getting wiped with warm wipes in mid of night or cold days.

296118,0,This product was fine but we needed the gel tabs instead of the powder so it wasn't exactly what we were looking for.
251867,0,This works great for my 8 month old. I just wish he didn't slide forward during his bath. I have to keep on sliding him towards the back of the seat. I just recently cut a rubber bath mat to insert it on the inside and that seemed to work well.

When I first started taking it I took 1 Tbs for a week to let my body get use to it after a week I started taking the 2 Tbs and there wasn't a problem"
371261,0,"This is a good price for Sodium Chloride Ophthalmic ointment. I use Sodium Chloride ophthalmic ointment for my dog's eyes for a condition diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. So please consult your eye doctor about purchasing and using this. This generic brand sold on Amazon is supposed to be comparable to Bausch & Lomb Munro 128 which costs twice as much as this generic brand. The main active ingredients are identical. The difference is in the Inactive ingredients: Bausch &Lomb Munro 128 has lanolin, mineral oil, purified water and white petroleum in this exact order. From my understanding ingredients are listed in order of most to least. So in Bausch & Lomb, there is more lanolin than mineral oil. In this generic brand offered by Amazon the list of Inactive ingredients are as follows: mineral oil, ""modified lanolin"" purified water and white petroleum. So this generic brand has more mineral oil than lanolin....AND the generic brand has ""modified lanolin"". Not sure what modified lanolin is. I have to say that my dog experiences a difference between the Bausch & Lomb Muro 128 and the generic brand and I do notice this difference in him. The generic brand is slightly irritating as seen by redness in my dog's eyes indicating discomfort/irritation(and if it gets really bad he will paw at his eyes/face)....probably due to the ratio/amount of mineral oil and the amount and type of lanolin used in this generic brand. Whereas, with the Bausch & Lomb Muro 128, my dog does not experience any redness, irritation or discomfort at all. So it is obviously on a person by person basis or in this case a dog by dog basis. And speaking as a person who takes a number a prescription medication for some chronic medical conditions, the brand name medication and the generic are not necessarily identical. The active ingredient is the same. And most people dont notice the difference between the two. Oftentimes, the difference is in the ""carrier"" ingredient and inactive ingredients. Some doctors may specify to you or the pharmacist that a brand name only is to be given. Discuss any issues with your doctor or pharmacist. And as a patient, parent, or guardian/advocate of a patient, please pay attention as to the effects of the medication when switching from brand name to generic whether it be an over-the-counter medication or brand name. So as far as this Sodium Chloride ophthalmic ointment 5% goes, use whatever works best for you or your pet.....regardless of price."

80360,1,I replaced the heads on my shaver with these and it works better now than it did when it was brand new. I get a much closer shave now.
378677,0,"We registered for this because my friend said she liked it and when I read the online reviews it had good scores - 4-5 stars. The first tub we bought leaked from the actual plug part so we took it back and tried again. This time it worked great for the first couple baths - no leaking. Then it started leaking from the plug and also the sides that snap together. I know it is put together correctly and I don't collapse the bath either when I store it, I store it as is. I use it on the kitchen counter and by the time the bath is over the floor and counter has puddles. I do like it that my baby is stable on the sling while I am washing her. I don't have to constantly have both hands on her holding her up. So I'll take the puddles - just thought this might be helpful."

184154,0,"I've known since I was a child that gargling with saltwater can help a sore throat, sometimes much more effectively than over-the-counter drugs can do. The notion of these handy, individually sized doses is a clever and practical one.In practice, however, they're much less practical. Sure, it's convenient to carry these portable doses in a pocket or bag, but they're so hard to open that you end up spilling a good portion of the dose on your hands, your clothes or, if you're lucky, the floor. Also, the saltwater has an unpleasant plastic flavor to it that makes gargling even more unpleasant than usual.So, is the convenience of the individual packaging outweigh the inconvenience of opening it and the bad taste? For me, no. I'm sure plenty of people will feel otherwise, however -- after all, modern marketing convinced us to buy bottled water, right? Saltwater is the next logical step.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor"
222109,0,"I've successfully recharged about 80% of my alkalines, including ones that dipped below 1.0V. The weakest battery that I was able to recharge had a baseline of 0.86V. All got ""renewed"" to about 1.5V or a little more. The other 20% refused to work. The only leakages I've experienced came from Rayovac AAA's, even though they had never been charged before. I have never charged any battery more than twice so I can't say if I can go beyond 5-10x, much less 100x. But the ""renewed"" batteries did perform like new alkalines.As for NiMH's, it does charge them but I wouldn't recommend using this charger for them since it only automatically shuts down for alkalines.It's hard to compare this to other alkaline chargers because it seems to use a different method. Most other alkaline chargers finish in about 16-18 hrs but this takes about 3 days. And while others recommend charging way before the battery is depleted (> 1.0V), this one doesn't. You can still charge if the battery is on its last breath.So while I agree that the hype is misleading, it does work -- at least to the extent that I've tested it. Aside from functionality, I should point out that the door is flimsy. I need to keep it shut with tape."
427134,0,Different companies use different sizing standards. It is best to look up the individual companies and find how the company decided on the size. This is marked a 5x so i expected it to be quite large when in fact it was not. Although with adjusts of added velcro it did work out. I did have to reinforce the product in some sewing spots as the sewing began to unravel after a few days of wearing the product.
35855,0,I tried this for my entire face but it did not work as good. I figured it would minimize the size of my pores and moisturize it as well. It is only good as an after shave. It minimized the razor burns.
267898,0,"I presume the Benecol is doing its anti-colestoral job, but I also take Lipitor. The Benecols are tasty but seem difficult to open since they are wrapped in foil tightly. A ""draw string"" would be helpful if it does not add to expense."

I liked that it beeps when the reading is complete, and I didn't miss needing to flick the mercury down on a glass thermometer. However, this thermometer is unbalanced when in the mouth. The digital display is part of the rather long (2.5 inches), heavy end that tips the entire thermometer away from the mouth.

99985,0,"I bought this after my Dr suggested I take Niacin to lower my Triglycerides. I tried a coated capsule type version and had a little itching but no other effects after taking two 500mg pills. It was a bit pricey so I found these at a better price.Yesterday I took two 500mg pills of this product and within about 20 minutes I started to get red and it got progressively stronger until my whole body was light red. This lasted for about 3.5 hours. I had heard about the flushing but never experienced anything like this. My heart rate was up and my skin felt very itchy. It was rough couple hours. But other than that no nausea or gastro issues.I'm going to try a little slower approach, maybe chopping 1 in half (250 mg) and taking it right before bed. Maybe with an Aspirin. If I get the same symptoms then I will toss these.My advice, start with a low dose."
142015,0,"This little stool is light-weight and just the right size to use in a small shower stall. It was easy to assemble and adjust. I am mainly using it as a stool for my dressing area. Set at it highest level, it acts as a perfect seat for putting on make-up, curling hair, etc. When I need to use it as a shower stool, it is easily moved and lowered to the lowest point. It does seem a little wobbley when used in the shower, but as a dressing stool on the carpet, it works fine. I think it probably can rust if left wet for any length of time, but for a low-price seat, it can serve a two-fold purpose of shower and dressing stool."

Changing the batteries and thoroughly cleaning it didn't help; it was just dead. Fortunately they're inexpensive enough that I wasn't too angry to buy a replacement. I haven't found another product like it; I just wish I didn't *have to* buy a replacement every few months. Surely the manufacturer could make it more sturdy?"
347865,0,"This product arrived 24 packs in a box. Two packs had leaks which caused a big mess upon opening. The damaged packs were identified and discarded. The clean up required gallons of water as the sticky gel surrounding most of the packs had to be washed thoroughly. I cannot imagine how the damaged packs could have been opened enroute, so the shipment must have left the dealer broken. Lesson learned, never buy bulk through the mail. It is too tempting for a unscrupulous dealer to unload damaged goods. So I saved nothing over retail cost by buying from this source. BTW: The gel taste great, that's why I gave it 3 stars."
54931,0,"The device works as advertized, but compresses the user's head due to the single point attachment of the traction strap (see illustration). I fabricated an 8 inch spreader to move the attachment points outward and greatly reduce the inward pressure on my head when using the device. Other products, such as the more 'cumbersome' water bag traction unit, have spreaders. It took me 10 minutes to bend a 1/4 inch hardware store rod into a spreader. For the Neck-Pro people to add that part would probably increase the cost of the unit by $5 or so. Well worth the increased cost in my opinion. I would not have been able to keep using the Neck-Pro without that modification."

234582,0,The best alternative would be to not use paper at all.. why you people can't just go to the bathtub and clean there with a bit of water and soap.. That's a lot more environment friendly and actually you end up clean.. when you use paper you actually are not cleaning you are just removing the waste. Or do you clean your hands with just paper? I don't think so. If you really want to clean (kill bacterial) you need to get use to wash with water and soap. Two great advantages:1. You are actually saving the planet but not wasting paper (not even recycle paper)2. Your butt will not stink anymore.
248784,0,"Price was definitely right. Vacuum seems to work well enough, but the trimmer itself is awkward to use. I've only used it three times and I'm still trying to get the trim length right."
362963,0,"Yes, the cover is soft but they are just flat pieces of paper with no elastic and no way to secure them to the headrest. You can't tuck them in and have them stay. The smallest movement means there's no coverage on a portion of the headrest. Since the vinyl on the table is marked from just the smallest amount of facial oil, let alone makeup, I would recommend still using something else to ensure your headrest is protected."
417069,0,"The product has performed much better than I expected however, I think the size of the package is somewhat deceptive. Stating the amount in the container in grams is not a reasonable way to describe the amount of product you receive. I doubt if one person in ten could tell you how many grams there are in an ounce. The best measurement is the 8+ repairs but that's easy to miss. You've fufilled your legal obligation but not your moral one. If you could put the ""8+ repairs"" in a box and not run the type over two different parts of the background, it would be easier to notice. Frankly,I doubt that there are actually 8+ repairs in the container. I could not make the same repair that I did another seven times. It would be more like four to five and my problem was re-cementing a cap. There is always a small amount of waste when you make a repair like this and you can't re-use the waste. After one aborted attempt, I successfully made the repair and it has been several weeks since I re-cemented the cap. I eat and brush afterwards and have experienced no subsequent problems."

These sticks are pretty cool way to check the presence of sugar in your urine. If you don't believe they work as described, dip one of those into a glass of sweet drink - the cyan tap of the stick will instantly turn brown indicating the presence of sugar in the liquid."
113312,0,"Decent razor, but why too pricey for what you get. Everything about it is pricey. I prefer my more simple previous razor that didn't require cleaning pods. I was hoping this razor would do what it said and shave closer than any other, but sadly my previous $60 razor gave as good, if not better, of a shave."

400084,0,"The sound quality on this thing isn't very great. The built in speaker is cheap quality, so I opened it up and removed it and wired in an external speaker that sits outside of the unit. It sounds a bit better, but it seems that the quality of the recorded sounds is not very good. Too much compression or something. Anyways, I leave it on the rain setting and it does help me fall and stay asleep, since I need background noise because I work overnight and sleep during the day."

242227,0,"Using waterproof epoxy, I glued the wire into the handle and it stopped spinning around. Now it works better. The wire is still a little too flimsy to make this the perfect tool. It would have helped if the wire had been stainless steel. I suspect this will not last long because the wire has started rusting after one shower. An excellent idea, they just fell short on the follow through.UPDATE: It is now June 25th, 2011 and I am amazed to report this item is still being used. I never expected this item to last even half this long and I see no reason why it would stop being useful any time soon.Based on this experience, I would increase my rating to four stars - it should still have a stainless steel wire and I shouldn't have had to epoxy in the handle. Other than that, a great product."

380843,0,1.Recently I have noticed a change in the pads. I don't have any of the old ones to compare but I am sure the newer ones are less effective in cleaning and get saturated with dirt much faster. I do not like them.2. I found by simply using a channel lock pliers or vice grips you can easily remove the cap on the bottles of cleaning solution and pour your own mix in the twist the cap back on. Cake and Pie. I use about a half cup vinegar and fill the rest of the way up with distilled water to prevent mineral deposits which could cause streaking.Now if I could find a good replacement for the pads which is cheaper +/or does a better job I would be happy.
249111,0,"I encountered two main problems with this trimmer. First, the length setting dial tends to slip out of place - if you push the trimmer against your face with any pressure, it slips down a notch to a closer setting... not good if you're trying to get an even trim. Second, the vacuum feature, which only caught about 50% of the hair anyway, broke after about a dozen uses.Another minor issue I had was with the size of the unit - it is a little too big for the face, especially for the moustache area under the nose, and around the mouth. I find I need to resort to my older and smaller model to finish the job after I trim with this one.Overall I would not recommend this product - there have to be better models out there than this."

154456,0,"I must say that it is impressive, and gratifying, to give your teeth the best brushing you know how, then turn on the water jet and watch all the hidden bits of detritus get chased out of their hiding places. It really does clean in places the brush can't reach, and if your teeth are tightly packed (like mine), it is much easier than flossing. The basic idea of cleaning with a pulsed water jet seems sound to me.That said, I really think there's room left in the market (the aging-boomer-healthcare market that is) for a quality, well-made dental irrigator. My Water Pik sounds like a little jackhammer running, the tubing to the handpiece is stiff and tangles easily, and... mine sprang a leak where the tubing enters the handpiece after about four months. A leak that sprays water all the way across the room, mind you. The handpiece is cheaply molded onto the tubing and can't be disassembled for repair, and the parts don't seem to be available.I'm here on Amazon shopping for an alternate brand, but it seems that they have similar shortcomings -- short life heading the list. So I repeat my remark, and hope that someone from Bosch or Panasonic or somewhere were they value quality stuff is reading... what this country (USA) needs is an irrigator that works well, stays together, and doesn't wake up the house!"
341326,0,"I've been using the Omron HEM 773AC for five months and am somewhat disappointed in that the readings, based on what my doctor's office finds, are not accurate. It reads considerably lower than my actual B/P. I can get an more accurate reading by carefully watching the monitor for the ""heart beat"" indicator to appear after the cuff cuts off flow. But the meter always reads much lower... for example when I observe the ""hear beat"" return at 130 the meter will read 100 to 110.The lower pressure I have no way of determining but I suspectit is always a little low, maybe by ten numbers. On the positive side the unit is easy to use and I am getting an ideaof what raises my B/P.I think three stars is more than fair for this machine."
126713,0,"Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars. Remember that three stars means it just okay, I am not hammering this product as I am sure some people will very much so enjoy it. If you are taking it for health purposes than I am sure you won't mind the taste at all as it is great tasting for medicine."
137030,0,"I bought this after reading all of the great reviews but regrettably failed to look at the product measurements. This baby bathtub is much bigger than any other I've seen, it filled my entire jacuzzi tub. I returned it and ordered a PUJ tub instead.I gave it 3 stars because I'm sure it's a great product but if you don't have a lot of room for storage or don't want your baby's tub to take up half of your bathroom, I'd look elsewhere."

321702,0,"I bought these to boost my phosphorus for a body experiment. Well it definitely has phosphorus, I just don't know how much. Like a lot of Hyland's products, it contains milk sugar, which makes it sweet and palatable. I don't like how Hyland's hides the amounts in their supplements, especially for a single supplement. They mask it with '30X'. What does that even mean? How about milligrams?This did nothing for a cough I had, nor did it have any other effect on me. I would recommend saving your money and eating foods high in phosphorus and save your money."

I bought the shampoo and conditioner at Whole Foods but they don't carry the Emulsion product. The shampoo and conditioner don't seem to add any more body than any other shampoo or conditioner on the market.The Emulsion product comes in a fairly small bottle which won't last long if you use their recommended dosage. As far as I can tell, it doesn't make my hair noticeably fuller. Hair gel would add more body for far less."
10617,0,"You can figure out your pH with this product but sometimes the color is splotchy and in between the numbers. It does the job well enough to know my salivas pH which is what I wanted. I liked that you could rip off what you needed instead of having pre-cut strips, but it doesn't rip that easily. I might buy this again but I am going to try another one and compare before purchasing this brand again."
359396,1,"I use this tea for menstral cramps. I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood. Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better. I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts. Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more. So again, it works but drink alot."
260441,0,The fragrance of this tea is wonderful. The taste is strong and spicy which I don't care for so at first I tried adding honey. The honey made it taste disgusting. So the next night I added 1% low fat milk which made the taste more tolerable. It also seems to make me drowsy so I drink it near bed time.
147370,0,"I didn't really care for this product. It did help a little with bad breath, but I didn't like the way it left my tongue feeling: it made it a little sore."
110560,0,This cleans your teeth well but is hard to hold on to since it's slippery. It's also harder to floss with because it's almost impossible to get a steady rubbing motion going between your teeth. Perhaps the slipperiness has to do with the fluoride coating. It will not break easily but requires more patience than conventional dental floss.
389754,0,"I didn't have a ton of money to spend on a stethoscope when I was required to get one for school, so this is the one I chose. It was nice and lightweight, and the ear pieces fit nicely.

27718,0,"I've used this product for over 6 months now but this is my first time buying a 10lb bag. The 3 star rating is there because of amazon's slow shipping.

This is a big step back as opposed to my previous experience with amazon, which my product came in a total of 3 days."

15033,1,"These are great. These are the first patches I have tried. I tried lozenges but they hurt my stomach and I tried gum, but found it kind of gross. A constant flow of nicotine is great! Way better than cigarettes for sure! These stay on great, no itching and I have had very little withdrawal symptoms. After showering the patches kind of start to come loose, but I just keep patting it down on my skin, eventually it dries out and sticks again. I bought mine from my local drugstore though, they were a little cheaper, sometimes were on sale and I had coupons.After smoking for 8 years, and in the past couple years, a pack a day, I put my patch on March 1st. I have not had a single puff since. (36 days.) After a month, I cut the patch in half and just wore 10.5 mg. They still stay on perfectly fine! I bought medical tape thinking I'd need it to hold it on, but haven't needed it yet. I plan to cut down to a 1/4th of patch when I feel ready. The say you shouldn't cut them down, but I don't see why you can't. It's working for me!Once they are on your body though, they can not be peeled off and restuck on. I didn't realize this and ended up throwing one away. But if you had medical tape you could just tape it on I would assume.Also what really helped me is a free online pdf book called ""Never Take Another Puff"". I STRONGLY suggest it."
224626,2,"Ladies...I have tried almost every method to shave my legs. I have pretty thick, course leg hair. Must be my German heritage! I've use razors (wastes water in shower), wax(messy) , neat(stinky and left behind strays), epi-ladies(which work but take forever to get the job done. I call it my midevil torture device, as it is painful the first couple of times you use it. My recommendation for this one is valium! And you don't stay hair free for eight weeks like it says. THOSE hairs you just ripped out will take that long to grow back but there is always new hair coming in, so a once a week session is still in order). My first electric was a Remington. That one lasted a couple of weeks as I didn't appreciate the fact that it sounded like a buzz saw and you could hear it running from 2 counties away. And it took too many passes. I then tried this Panasonic ES2216. It was definitely a little quieter, but still louder than my hubby's Norelco. It worked fairly well at first, but before a year was even up, it stopped cutting my hairs. I would go out in daylight and be horrified at the amount of hair it missed. I replaced the blades and it still wouldn't cut my hair. So while my hubby was away (SHHH!) I pulled out his Norelco triple headed Speed XL that was at least 2 years old and had rarely been cleaned or had a blade replacement and it was like OMG! Fast, QUIET, and did the job. So here is what I recommend. Ditch those ladies specific shavers if you want a clean, close, quiet shave and go out and get yourself a manly shaver for those womanly legs. You'll be glad you did. I just got the Norelco 8250 Speed XL and it was sweet! Women's razors just don't cut it."

334039,0,"Though one of WaterPik's least expensive models, my wife and I find the WP-360W to be more effective and reliable than all WaterPik's priciest models (which disappointed us). Biggest problem: replacement styluses are hard to find and excessively expensive. Also, the dark blue stylus is inferior to the clear one. Usage tip: don't keep the unit charging all the time because that will burn out the charger, ruin the battery or both (in any case it will make the unit stop working permanently)."
166868,0,"I ordered this thinking it was the Syntha-6. So right off the bat I was disappointed. But it's a good mass-gaining protein and the flavor is not bad. The best one I ever tasted was Muscletech's Nitrotech Chocolate Caramel... mmmm. I got a free sample of Myofusion Chocolate and it tasted a smoother and it didn't clump up with the cold water like this stuff. But if you want to put on some mass but can't eat a million meals a day, supplement with this. The price is really decent from Amazon as opposed to Like GNC retail. I put on about 10lbs in a couple of months while power lifting for 2 months or so... I hope it was muscle.Also, I ordered this as a monthly subscription and this 6lb bottle ended being too much for me (I don't always eat 2-3 double scoops per day). My wife would use it now and then too as a snack or breakfast replacement. I would probably just get the smaller size per month and just eat smore normal food if I was you. If you are a protein shake black hole, then this size will be perfect for you."

35885,1,"The way I talk about Quercetin, you would think I'm on Source Natural's payroll. I've given handfuls of this away to friends and many of them have gone on to buying their own. I take it daily as an antioxidant;(two in the morning), then if I get the sniffles or any allergy symptoms I take another dose as an antihistamine. Finally, if my back or other joints are hurting, I take it for inflammation. I'm pretty careful to stick within the 6 caplet max suggested on the bottle but there have been times when I've gone over. One benefit I find is that when I take it for allergy symptoms, the anti-inflammatory properties soothe the tissues of my sinuses and calm down the stuffiness as well as the headache I sometimes get from the sinus thing. Within a week of this being suggested by my doctor, I was able to stop using Claratin completely. It's nice to know that something so natural (it's made from the skins of red apples and red onions) can work so well with none of the side effects or drug interactions from the normal drugs (sleepiness and worse). And I'm delighted that I can get it on auto-delivery from Amazon with free shipping. I don't usually give 5 stars but this is one of the best things I've ordered from Amazon."

It comes on and off really easy, my two year old daughter can do it herself now. We purchased the first one in white and then found it in PINK!!! So we sent the white one to Grandma's and now my daughter feels comfortable there too, so a great thing for Grandma to have as well.

I tried bars from both boxes and not only is the taste off, but I felt nauseous after eating them.I reported this to the manufacturer. They acknowledged ""taste variations"" and offered to send replacements. HOWEVER, the rep. was reluctant to send more of the same type of bar for fear that I'd receive an identical batch. The rep. offered to send samples of another type of bar, but unfortunately I've yet to see them in the three weeks since the call.In the end, while I like this product, I'll be waiting a while before I order any more. If the folks at Clif Bar don't make good on a replacement or reimbursement, I'll probably never order again."

I only wish there was more texture such as actual full peanuts inside. But I digress this is the most accurate representation of any flavor for a nutrition bar. It's a must-buy!
211403,0,"Wow. Well, this stuff is definitely not for me. I am a vegetarian and have not crossed the line and become a vegan. My tastebuds were a little scared of this stuff. Though I must say, for the appearance of cheese, when mixed properly, it was fairly passible. I think if I had not been eating cheese for a while, this would probably taste pretty good, but . . . it's just not my thing."

224668,0,"Ive used ladies electric shavers all my life. I expected this product to be one of the best since its from the reputable panasonic brand. However Im disappointed. It does the job but have to run it several times plus it gives me ingrowths. I used a cheaper conair shaver where the blades were sharper & gave me a much closer shave, almost like the razor and never had ingrowths either. I wouldnt buy another panasonic shaver again in a hurry."
160495,0,"I am a company truck driver. Many of our trucks have very high mileage and the seats are worn out. I need a cushion to relieve the pressure on my tail bone. I spent about $10 more for this cushion because I saw the word ""memory"" in the description of the foam. When I hear that word, a temper pedic type of foam is what I think of. This foam seems like regular old foam. It also seems very firm not extra soft as described."
304541,0,I was upset to find that this add was for ONE brush head only. The price was comparable to three heads on eBay.While this seams to be a genuine Oral-B brush the quality is poor compared to other heads I have purchased.
276863,0,"I drink it at work in the morning so all the gas it sometimes causes is out of me before I go home to the family. not sure if it is the powder or the glutamine supplement I also take but my recovery time seems to be faster between workouts. I'm not as sore the next day after a heavy workout. In my opinion most of these supplements are 50% marketing and 40% empty promises. The remaining 10% consists of either a credible product backed by actual research or a jug of non-dairy creamer. I bought this because the product I really like, Optimum Nutrition Whey, cancelled my sub-n-save and the Synthra was on sale. Maybe I'll get more Synthra, most likely try something else. Just like short guys in lifted trucks or bald guys in sports cars, anything this flashy is compensating for deficiency elsewhere."
241422,0,"What I noticed first and foremost, was that the mat is MUCH smaller than it appears in the ads. We have a standard size & shaped tub, and this mat is about six inches short of reaching the end. It's also fairly thin. I'm 5'3"", and 120 lbs. I fit on it, but not by much. I doubt a tall person would fit it very well at all. I wanted a mat that would support my head and neck, this is too short to do that. You will absolutely need a bath pillow with this item. With that said -- I otherwise enjoy it. It's much less expensive than a hot tub. The suctions work well (standard smooth tub). It helps my muscles relax, and my two-year old enjoys it. It is loud, but I don't really notice the blower noise over the turbulence of the water and it drowns out the distractions from other rooms."
400063,0,"Good points: One, I was a little taller. Two, at first, it's similar to putting on a new pair of running shoes. Bad points: One, it gave me back problems with extended wear. This is similar to the lifts that may be provided by a chiropractor. The theory is that although one type of pain may be relieved with use, the body must compensate for the physical shift. This shift often causes pain in another part of the body. Overall, this probably isn't a product I would purchase, especially not at the price."
389402,0,"This splint is very lightweight and as comfortable as a product like this can be expected to be. I was able to sleep in it without too much bother. However, it seems to have an angle to it that actually stretches my achilles tendon out too much. You can adjust it to make the angle smaller, but not larger, which is what I would need. I do have to say that the company sent me an e-mail stating that they have a money back guarantee and that I could send it back, but I'm opting to keep it, thinking that if any of us ever injure our ankles, it could serve as a somewhat suitable brace."

342067,0,This wrap fits great around your arm but in order to warm the gel pack you have to boil water and then put the pack in the water to heat it. Every other gel pack allows you to microwave it and you're done in 30 seconds. Its too bad I can't find another gel pack that will fit in the wrap but that would provide a better solution.

191294,0,This product is hard to evaluate as the results do not happen very quickly and there are some many additional factors to it proving helpful.
170030,1,Tastes just like Root Beer. Favor it over the vanilla. It's very sweet. If you add too much it can get bitter like any stevia.
269360,0,"Like only one other reviewer, I too, dislike the slight pressure against my eyes when the Velcro band is tightened enough to prevent slippage. Loosening the Velcro strap to lift the mask a bit then allows light in (maybe only a problem for us light sensitive sleepers?) On the Plus Side, the mask is very soft. Also, after use for over a year, the elastic is loosing its stretch."
63818,0,It works everytime for me. It can be a bit sensitive if you rush and not wait for the correct prompts. It always gives me an accurate reading.
32272,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
326093,0,It's ok. I wanted something safe to use in my self-cleaning oven for those spills/spots so I wouldn't have to do the full cleaning. It was so-so - did not work as advertised in my oven.

163447,0,"I bought my Diva Cup 1 after having some serious thoughts about tampons, pesticides, and my reproductive organs.I hate super long reviews, so I will make this quick and to the point.I researched ALOT before purchasing so I knew what to expect: different folding techniques, that there would be a learning curve trying to insert it, that it would be messy, that I needed at peri bottle to clean the cup and myself with after taking it out, to aim towards to back of your tailbone when putting it in, to be patient, to use a bit of water to make it easier to insert, to trim the tip, run your finger along the rim once inserted to make sure its popped open all the way, to twist the cup once it is in to secure a good suction, etc.Having said all of that...It wasn't too hard to insert, take out, clean. I got the hang of it pretty quickly. And I have never had a leak, so thats great news!But, I am a heavy bleeder my first 3 days, and this cup filled up quickly. No way I would have lasted 12 hours, or even 5 hours. So, keep in mind that if you are a heavy bleeder, you WILL be changing this in a public restroom. That, ladies, is what bums me out. It is more cumbersome and time consuming to take a peri bottle with you everywhere find a stall, take it out, dump it, clean it (ALL WHILE TRYING NOT TO DROP IT IN THE TOILET), clean yourself, insert it, twist it, make sure its in right, fill up the bottle again, wash your hands, etc etc. With a tampon you take it out and put a new one in, simple.I think I will use the Diva Cup on my light days and at night, but my first 2 heavy days, I feel more at ease with a tampon for public restroom purposes.Hopefully, as time goes on I won't mind it as much and will try again to use it all the time.Just do your research, be patient, and give it a try."

47978,0,"I have never found a circular nose trimmer that trims my hairs close enough and this is no exception.

It did achieve hormonal balance , now i get my periods on time without much spotting before or after , the two downsides it has is that if i take full does it gives me headachs, not sure why as it is not listed on side effects that are common , second thing it makes me bloated big time .. salmon fish is more appropriate with me I will not rebuy, but i will continue to use it like three times a week for hormonal balance effects and only take half the dose.."
169988,0,This is a good product if you just want to whiten your nails or stop a fungal nail infection when it has just started. Not recommended for advanced infections.
421274,1,This stool comes in very handy for clients who may need a bit of assistance climbing onto or off of my massage table. The handle is padded well and very comfortable to grip and provides excellent support
300504,0,Bought this on recommendation from our doctor for my teenage daughter due to her fatigue. She cannot stand the taste or consistency. Has anyone tried putting it into gel caps and taking them that way? Would this decrease the effectiveness?
402403,0,I bought this tub because we are traveling overseas. The tub is nice and cut. My problem with this tub is the smell... This tub has a smell that does't go away easily.
426418,0,"I bought from Vitacost, the 66 Day Supply (2.2 lbs.) It was way too much to store, or have on the counter, as I have a small duplex. The taste was not that great, but I did get used to it after a few months of trying to use it and hating it. I do feel better but the amount of gas I have after about 4 hours is weird!!!Maybe it's an over 50 thing but I don't like that side effect!"
308752,0,I've used the older version of this razor for many years. Decided to get a new one and put in RV. I've used the new razor for about 3 months. It works but the blade part keeps coming off of handle. Wish I could find who sold it to me through Amazon. Definitely needs to be replaced.
172430,0,"I think the banana flavor was overwhelming for me because I normally have issues with drinking protein anyway, so combined I was not impressed. I think had I gone with vanilla it would not have been quite as bad for me. The protein in it was GREAT for what I needed it for and could tell it was working, but the taste was dreadful. I would only recommend to those with strong stomachs or who are VERY used to drinking protein. Note of caution: must drink fast! The left over fluid on the lip gets hard very quickly (similar to an egg) and is unappetizing when you pick the drink back up to start drinking again."
98268,0,"I was very happy with these ice packs, I have several of different sizes, however the two 7.5x11 ones which I use fairly regularly both sprung leaks along the seams within 6 months. I could not recommend these to anyone who relies on ice packs to treat neck or back pain and uses them frequently. I have contacted the seller to find out if mine are still under warranty. As ice packs they perform wonderfully but once the goup surprises you, you wont be very happy. This is a real pity as I purchased them based on the fantastic reviews I saw on Amazon and had high hopes for a long life for them.UPDATE: The manufacturers replaced the two leaking ice packs under warranty terms. All I had to do was send them my Amazon invoice. I have changed my review to 3 stars based on this. The other ice packs continue to work as promised."
318393,1,I purchased a Norelco 9160XL Smart Touch razor about a year or so ago. Bought these replacement heads as the original ones were worn out. Now the razor is working very well and I am back to enjoying my morning shave.Changing the heads took less than 5 minutes. One thing I would recommend is that you routinely take the heads out (every 45 days or so) and give it a good wash.
58679,0,"This Medicool insulin protector is much larger than it looks in the picture. It may insulate adequately, but we returned it, because it would not easily fit into my husband's diabetes tote bag."
388304,2,"I bought this for my father who just had a stroke. He came home in June, and used this for one month. Today, the welding that holds the cane upright snapped and he can no longer use this product. Luckily, he wasn't hurt when he fell after the welding snapped except for a few bruises. He only weighs 145 lbs, and was using the product exactly as intended. I do not recommend this product for anyone with a fall risk, even though I don't know who else would actually need something like this."
309174,0,"This thing is definitely effective. I bought it with the Trigger Point therapy book others suggested here. I haven't read it yet, but will when I get a chance. Although this product works and I imagine it's really helpful for people with difficult to reach problems etc, I found the homedics shiatsu pillow just as effective for getting right into my knots, and all I have to do is position it and lean on it. Thus, I've used the massage pillow much much more. That thing is genius. For more specific stuff, this is probably a good thing to have around. Also, the booklet is very helpful, and may be all you need to give yourself a good massage."
378673,0,I have to agree with everything the other Reviers said except that we have been fortunate that we don't have leaks or had the flooding but I can see that this van happen. Our son is 16 months old and still baths in his. He got this sudden fear for the water. I have to admit that we only started to use that bath part at about 11 months. We used the insert where he can lie down from very small and never the sitting ring. I got this as a gift very early in my pregnancy so never investigated my options. Rather look at the other options as it does take up a lot of space too.
61063,0,"It's not a bad cleaner, but I bought it mistaking it for the Lime-o-sol cleaner of the same name and a similar bottle. The other version is beyond awesome and I continue my search for it.I thought Trademarks were supposed to prevent this kind of confusion."
156898,0,"I purchased and installed the new shaver heads and was amazed that they made no difference in the quality of my shave. I have used my shaver for several years with the original heads and had received at least one warning that recommended that I replace the heads - years ago. I used my shaver daily, have normal skin, and have a normal beard. From my experience, I wouldn't recommend replacing the heads unless you really have a noticable problem. Don't replace just because they are old. Replace when obviously broken and not functioning correctly."
270942,0,"I bought this to get my kids started on an Omega-3 supplement and it's a great idea; however, while it's probably the best option you have for kids, it does not taste good. It has an unpleasant orange taste, certainly OK enough for an adult, and maybe for some kids, but for many kids I think you will have a battle. My daughter will take it mixed in some chocolate yogurt but she's a really good sport. My son HATES it in every combination I've tried so far. It is very hard to mask the dominant orange taste. I am trying it today in a couple of tablespoons of raspberry sorbet and see if that will fly--it might as the supersweet flavor of the sorbet goes a long way to mellowing the orange. Bottom line: not every kid is going to like this, and with good reason."
114678,0,"The 1775 is a fairly good value because it's inexpensive, but it takes me 20-30 minutes to get a good shave with it because I have to go over each area of my beard several times to get it close. Lectric Shave helps, although Braun does not recommend using it.I had one problem in the first two weeks with the shaver: the foil developed a hole for no apparent reason. After calling Braun customer service, they shipped me a new one promptly and I have had no further troubles. Ironically, I was not using Lectric Shave with it at the time."
45419,0,"This shaver does well on the checks and the face, give a smooth finish, but it does not give a clean shave under the chin ( on your throat). I dont know about others but my growth is quick and thick, but at this price it was a decent buy"
180371,0,"I like this product. However, it is much cheaper at the local health food store which I can drive to. The price is too high."
392857,0,"I thought this would be the perfect bathtub for my infant son. Well, it is okay, but definitely not perfect. However, I am not sure there is a perfect one out there. This tub does have a lot of nice features. It has 2 built-in positions, one that is reclined for infants, and one that is upright for older babies and toddlers. It also comes with a sling that can be used for sponge bathing newborns, however I never used it. It fits in any size sink (single or double). The drain turns white when the water is too hot. My biggest problem with the tub is that my 3-month-old son hates to sit in the reclined section, but can't sit up well enough on his own to be in the upright section. I can't give him a bath by myself b/c I need my husband to hold my son up for me while I wash him. If you have a baby that is content to be reclined than you will probably really like this tub."
283015,2,My husband had a terrible tooth ache so I heard that this was the best thing to use. Just make sure you aren't allergic to clove oil. He was throwing up for an hour and we had to call poison control. I know first hand how terrible a tooth ache can be but make sure you read the label entirely and be aware of the side effects.
31846,0,"I have to say that I am one of those people constantly looking for the perfect product. I recently purchased this at the AOS store while questioning the sales person who stated she was also a cosmetologist. I don't know if that is at all of use, but she assured me that I needed the lotion and not the gel for my skin type. I was concerned that with the Shea butter/oil it might be a bit thick. She stated not at all, it would not be a problem. I had been usingEdwin Jagger 99.9% Natural Moisturizing Aftershave Lotion - Sea Buckthorn, 3.4-OunceWhich I really liked, but it does contain some alcohol, so I thought I would try a brand without.I must say that the AOS lemon is a very pleasant scent. It does go on a bit thick and I did notice a residue (dare I say oily/greasy) that seemed to linger most of the day. I also developed the start of a pimple on my jawline. I am 41 and haven't had a pimple in I can't remember how long, so I did attribute this to the heaviness of the lotion. The next day I used my alum block (Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block) and then applied the lotion. It seemed to resolve the pimple, I didn't feel as heavy a residue on my face, but I could feel the lotion all day, never seemed to get fully absorbed.Summary: This is a decent product, with a pleasant scent and does seem to moisturize face well post shave. I do like the Edwin Jagger lotion better, considering both are at about the same price point. I believe the oils in the latter probably offset the small amount of alcohol present (not enough to feel any sting on application)."
320106,1,"I'm a lip balm junkie, and this is the best. I've been using it for years, and even though I've liked some other brands, nothing matches Burt's Bees. It's moisturizing, goes on without feeling sticky or thick, and lasts. It fixes my amazingly chapped lips, even in harsh weather. The mintiness is refreshing and soothing. I also like that it's all-natural, since I use a lot of chapstick and want to minimize chemical intake where I can.I've also tried the other flavors, and while they're generally good, nothing beats the original. I highly recommend it."

301502,0,"Someone below claimed that no reputable ophthalmologists believe bilberry helps with eye disorders. (Though he was specifically writing about macular degeneration.) I am posting under this product only in response to that. I am not specifically recommending this version of bilberry, because I do not know what the actual standardized content is for this product. I do, however, believe bilberry may be an option for those experiencing or potentially facing eye-related disorders involving blood flow and the vascular system of the retina and optic nerve. I base this on the preponderance of data available in PubMed and elsewhere that appears to demonstrate bilberry's effectiveness at increasing blood flow within the optic apparatus, and at maintaining the health and strength of the all-important capillary system.My experience comes from my own extensive review of the available data (PubMed, etc.), as well as discussions with multiple ophthalmologists and neuro-ophthalmologists (including at one of the country's more prestigious eye institutes). Bilberry, like Lutein, was not included in the AREDS study on which Preservision and other similar supplements are based, and the AREDS study is 'the' study on which many ophthalmologists base their professional opinions. That Lutein and Bilberry were not included in the AREDS study, however, does not mean there is not quite significant empirical data behind both. Lutein clearly, measurably affects the macula and pigment deposition, and there is a wealth of empirical data demonstrating this. Bilberry clearly, measurably affects blood flow in the eye and improves capillary performance and health, which can have significant benefit in a number of eye disorders.Macular degeneration is a varied disease process. Some people respond to some treatments, some people don't. Some people who would have responded to treatment early are too far down the road to see improvement from anything, while others who begin treatment after the process has begun do see benefit. Whether bilberry is part of the answer for you for macular degeneration does not in the slightest way change the fact of the weight of research demonstrating it does have beneficial effects for eye health in a number of disease processes. That does not mean that taking it will make you see better, though in some people (and papers) that certainly seems to be the case. It does mean that for those with disease processes that are ongoing (retinopathies, possibly some glaucoma patients, possibly some patients who have had significant radiation to the optic nerve and/or retinas) it may well help slow or stop those processes, and may stave the processes off for others beginning early. (In radiation-related eye degeneration, typically there is a latency period of several months to a few years before the effects begin, and those effects are typically largely the result of the breakdown of the vascular/microvascular systems of the optic apparatus.)"
179105,1,Great for bath. Prompt service. I buy from Amazon frequently and trust them. Thank you.
102201,2,"I have the pollen allergy; wanted to share my experiences so that it will help others. Wanted to try the natural/alternative medicines before trying the ""over the counter"" anti-histamines. I thought of going to allergy doctors, but dropped the idea after hearing people's experiences. Tried this ""outdoor allery"" and also the ""tree pollen allergy"", as both are homeopathic. Zero relief; no cure at all.Tried the apple cider vineger (ACV), which seemed to have helped many people in permanently curing allergy problems; but that also did not help me. Loratadine based medicines (claritin, alavert etc) did not help me either. Cetrizine based medicines worked out very well, but only as long as I take a tablet everyday; so, these chemicals seem to be more of a suppression than a permanent cure (these medicines suppress the histamine production in the body).Trying out the Triphala powder (ayurvedic) at the moment; not of much help so far, but need to wait and see for few more days. And waiting for the Neem powder to arrive in mail, as Neem juice seem to cure many fundamental health problems. Based on my research on the net so far, millions of people suffer with allergies; a medicine helping one person may not help other, so you have to give it a try with different medicines, including alternative medicines and see which one helps you. Hope this was useful."

80074,0,I was somewhat disappointed with this shaver only because the handle is so narrow it's hard for a gal with large hands to hold. It works well on underarms but misses leg hair. I don't like the idea of the cleaning system as I probably will never use it since it takes up too much room.
397568,0,"I tried this stuff for a while. It does exactly what it says on the tin. If you follow the instructions you will lose weight. I lost about 14 lbs in two weeks, and I was not terribly overweight.So why not get 5 stars?1. It's boring. The first shake is great, the second isn't bad. By the end of week 1 you are fit to slit your wrists if you see another.2. The weight comes straight back on as soon as you stop. The instructions tell you to go on other diets, but the problem is, you learn nothing about eating on the slimfast diet.3. It can't be good for you. I don't care what they say on the tin. It feels wrong.So, I lost my weight permanently by learning how to eat properly on a proper balanced diet. If you want to learn how to lose weight, it's easy. Go to a doctor who will tell you this:&quot;no alcohol for a year, and lose 14 lbs - then come back for a test. If the test is clear I don't have to perform a liver biopsy&quot;That worked for me.The secrets to losing weight:1. No alcohol- none- ever.2. No bread - none - not even dry granary toast.3. All food consumed in three meals per day made from food that you prepared yourself- no snacks-none- no fast food, and steer clear of restaurants because they are full of bread and wine.4. Leave the car - walk.5. Drink lots of water.It's boring, but it works better than Slimfast.However - if you are getting married in two weeks and can't fit in your dress - Slimfast could be just what you need."

421893,0,"Well, it's a toothbrush, so it's not like you can really go wrong with it, but it certainly wasn't my favorite.Pro:REALLY CHEAP!Con:Too skinny! I feel like a giant having this in my hands. And the brush itself is also skinny, and I feel like it doesn't cover my teeth completely, which means I have to brush twice as long to go over the top and bottom of the tooth since the brush doesn't reach the entire tooth."
277172,0,"Since there are lots of other reviews, I would like to limit my comments to a few remarks that are not always addressed by others.The cane is strong enough to support weight. The hand grip is some kind of foam, not very comfortable. It gives a good grip but will probably become grubby. I prefer a grip that fits the hand better and that is easier to wash.The second point is that the rubber tip is fine on a super clean floor but if there is anything on the floor, it will slip. I spilled some herb powder and nearly took a dive.All-in-all, if I had it to do over again, I would buy a completely different cane.Update: I did buy another cane, same company but foldable and with a wooden handle (and less expensive). I like it better except for one detail. The foam handle and curve in the cane make it easier to hang from a counter. However, unless this is important, I would definitely say the foldable cane is more comfortable and more aesthetic. Moreover, it does not seem weaker."
20449,0,"I bought this cushion to get some relief from sacroiliitis in driving two hour intervals. The cushion is really too wide to properly fit the flat bottom part of my car's U-shaped bucket seat, so the sides of the cushion rise up and put pressure on the back of my thighs. This becomes moderately painful after about 30 minutes, but the pain is tolerable. I do get relief with the cushion from the much more severe pain previously experienced in my tailbone that radiated down my right leg. I'm tempted to trim the sides of the cushion to better fit my car seat and give my thighs some relief."

I think if my shoes weren't already broken in they might fit a bit better. I'd recommend putting them in a new pair of shoes and giving them a few weeks."
266844,0,"Definite points for value and ease of use...my only comment is a word of caution for ladies with PCOS. PCOS can cause constantly higher LH readings throughout the cycle, which tends to make OPK's harder to use, generally speaking. I've been using other brands of LH test strips for about 4 cycles now, and while it's always hard for me to ID a surge (possibly because of lack of ovulation due to the PCOS), I do always have at least a few days of very clear negatives...ie, only the control line visible.Last cycle was the first cycle I used this brand. I've used 25 strips at this point, 20 during last cycle over the course of 15 days (cycle days 11-25). Based on other fertility signs (BBT shift, CM patterns, etc.), it looks like I ovulated around cycle day 17, however every single test...from day 11 to 25 (with multiple strips on days 16-19) of last cycle and the first five days of this cycle...have shown the exact same, nearly positive, but no clear positive and no clear negative (with once exception...day 21 last cycle was a very clear negative, with only the control line present).Not that it's necessarily the products fault, and clearly not every woman with PCOS is the same, but this brand doesn't appear to work well for me. I can say that every test has had a clear control line, and therefore for women who's bits and pieces work correctly, these would presumably work fine! Just a friendly word of caution for PCOSers."

378830,0,"I bought this tub because of its collapsibility and because it looked like it would last longer than other infant tubs. Ironically, I have never once collapsed it. It was great when my daughter was very little, and I can still use it now even though she is 9 months old, so I guess that it has outlasted other infant tubs out there. Mine never leaked DURING a bath, BUT if I tried to pick up the tub with water in it (I would fill it in the bathtub and then pick it up and put it on the counter), sometimes water would start pouring out of the bottom if I did not keep it completely level. Overall, I'd say it's an adequate tub but don't buy it because of the collapse feature alone, I don't think you'll use it."

112981,0,"I bought this shaver for two reasons:1. My previous shaver ""Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men's Shaver, Blue/Yellow"", which I lost when I moved, was a great shaver and gave me a clean shave even with 50% charged battery.2. I was attracted to the price of this item and the bonus trimmer, which by the way does a 'not too bad' job.Now, after I have tried using it for more than a month or two, I am not completely satisfied with the shaver. Wet or dry, it does not give me a clean shave. After I use this shaver, I still have to use my razor for clean up. That makes me unhappy. I also tried keeping it fully charged always, but even then the shave is not completely clean. I think it must be an issue with the blades; they just won't clean me up. And for the note, I don't have hard beard hair and since I shave everyday my beard hair is quite short and I expect the shaver to clear it off, which it does not.Having said that, the shaver itself will give about 95% clean shave when you shave back to back twice or thrice. But then it leaves your face burning and itchy after that. Again, it did not happen with my previous Panasonic shaver. I still carry it with me when I travel and use it when necessary but with not complete satisfaction.Now, for my regular shave I have given up on the shaver and gone back to using the razor again. I will wait for a while before i buy another shaver now. The nose trimmer, however, does a good job and i have no complaints on that.I wish i had spent the extra bucks and bought the other Panasonic shaver.P.S. Let me be a little show off ;> and share with y'all that the seller had sent me two orders for a single payment by error and they were not even aware of it. I was honest enough to return the second one and they promptly reimbursed the shipping cost."

307247,2,"I ordered Forest Green but this green is hideous! It looks more like a dayglo reptilian skin that should be oozing some kind of radio-active green goo. Obviously a trait that does not show on either computer monitor that I re-checked after receiving this.My favorite color is green. I was expecting a calming natural green as is usually suggested by Forest Green. There is nothing natural looking about this color. Instead, it looks like something better suited for a toy dinosaur. YUCK!I have their original Black leather-like portfolio and it is much nicer and more professional looking. I have carried it for 7 years with no problems. Liked it so much that I decided I wanted another when I saw they had added the shoulder strap. I chose the green this time so I could easily differentiate between my singles and blends cases. What a mistake!This green looks cheap and and the white backing only adds to the sensory insult."

63418,0,"This is NOT a review of the retailer. This is a review only of the Sony NH-14WM battery. I have owned five of these batteries over the past four years and I use them to power a Sony MZ-M100 Minidisc recorder. One I had to return right away as the positive side wasn't shaped correctly enough to fit the charger nor the equipment. Two of the four left burned out after a year of rotating, medium use (I was careful to fully charge and discharge each time so memory bands were not the issue). I now have two left and they lose 50% of their charge within a day. Of all the rechargeable batteries I own these perform the worst. It is frustrating when a company forces you to use an 'odd' shape battery and then charge almost a third of the cost of the equipment it powers...and then the product performs mediocre. Come on Sony give us a break!"
111928,0,"A good price for these, but after using them on my beard a couple times the cutter started yanking hair out instead of cutting.

It is frustrating that I cannot use my preferred size but its not the end of the world."
95661,0,"I got this just the other day to fix my Waterpik oral irrigation appliance. The problem with the original appliance is that it is made of plastics that exhibit little or no durability. After less than a year, the plastic hose sprung a leak, and started spurting water. Within no time, the whole hose just broke off, because the plastic becomes too brittle. I stashed the Waterpik in a cabinet, because it was just too expensive to throw out. When I saw this repair kit, I thought it would be worth a try. I noticed that some others had disregarded the instructions NOT to open the machine, because they could not replace the hose anywhere along it's length and had to install it at the source.I kept trying to cut the original hose back, but while trying to push the small nipple at the end of the replacement hose into the remaining length of the original, the old plastic would simply break apart. I tried soaking the end of the old plastic hose in hot water to soften it, but the length simply got shorter and shorter. And so did my patience.I ended up taking the whole machine apart, and was finally able to soften up a small length of the old hose inside the housing, and just BARELY flexible enough to accept the repair nipple - using a hot water bath.I might have given the replacement hose another star because in the end it did make the appliance workable again. But I don't know if it's the same plastic that will just stiffen with a little time and crack like the original. And I feel that Waterpik doesn't deserve 5 stars for a product that requires a replacement part like this to keep it running more than a few months.Waterpik seems to have managed to cut every possible corner on materials, while still producing a relatively expensive appliance with a rather short life span.I like to think that a company would find ways to identify and improve on design and material flaws, but I'm not sure Waterpik is trying too hard to do anything but cut costs at the consumer's expense.So, this is worth a try if you're Waterpik hose has bitten the dust. But it's not easy to install, and the jury is still out on whether it is a durable fix."

173172,1,"Do you need a battery grip for your Canon 20D? I did! I've used one with my Canon 300D and got use to it in a hurry. When I got a 20D I had to get a battery grip for it. I really like the added shooting capacity I get by having a 2nd battery in place. I also like having something for my hand to grip. The BG-E2 adds just enough for my fingers to curl around it and I have better control of the camera. The downside is the added weight. If you think the camera is heavy enough already this accessory is probably not for you. If you don't mind the weight because you are always using big lenses and carry a monopod around this is a nice addition to your camera bag. I use a Canon 28-105mm as my walk around lens and the grip's added weight is not a problem for me. I don't use the monopod unless I break out my 300mm or 400mm lenses. That 2nd battery is nice to have if you are shooting a lot of picures and the flash is firing too. I also have a second set of batteries with me just in case. I've never had to swap batteries during a shoot. I've gotten the low battery warning a few times but kept on shooting. I took over 200 photos at a car show, many with flash, and didn't have to change batteries. Without the flash firing the photo count would be a lot higher.I've rated this product four stars. If the weight could somehow be reduced and if it fit more than just the 20D it would earn a five star rating from me."

I wear it when I go to the gym and it seems to help but it's hard to say...basically my ankle feels the same as before I bought it but I haven't had any additional flare ups so maybe that's because of the brace.

I cannot say if I had it to do again, I would bother with this wax.That said, the styling brush is rather good, The comb is of sufficient depth to reach the underlying skin, but not so long as to be cumbersome, with fine enough tines to sort out unruly facial hair quickly.

Maybe some sort of washer will fix that one.3. The head halter is too small. I can barely get the end of the velcro to connect, and I feel like it'll strangle me.

38547,0,"I used to use mouthwash regularly until I realized I was swallowing too much of it.My choice was always Listerine. With such an awful taste you know it's got to be good. And it is. Listerine is a very good mouthwash.But mouthwash is not meant for human consumption. Inevitably, we'll swallow some every now and then. Oral pore absorption is also to be considered.I pondered alternatives. One stood out: vodka.Now, alcohol has never appealed to me. Even most wines taste like turpentine to me. However, vodka you can swallow; mouthwash you should not. This one difference was enough to make me switch.I chose Smirnoff vodka for two good reasons: (1) It was nearest the door and (2) it was on sale. I bought a bottle of 80 proof. It also comes in 90 and 100 proof bottles, suitable for those equipped with tougher tongues than mine.According to my dentist, Dr. Teplitsky, vodka kills germs and cleans the mouth. It heals small sores and eliminates plaque. If swallowed accidentally it's not a problem. ""Just don't report me to the AMA,"" he said.""No problem, doc. How about the KGB?""Vodka has helped me overcome sore throats. A once a day gargle/rinse seems to suffice.

15266,0,"The Almond Brownie bar was OK. The taste was just as good as any other power-type bar that I've tried. But it wasn't something that I'd crave. I expected it to provide me with more energy, kind of like taking a vitamin. Perhaps not that day, but the next. To be honest, I didn't notice much difference in my level of energy. With the price that they charge for purchasing a power bar, I don't think I'd recommend it to friends and family. I do think that I may purchase them again for myself though."
416725,2,"I've used Clubman for some time now, and I love it. I had been using the chestnut variety, as that was what was available to me when I began buying wax. If you've used the colored waxes (and use your fingers to apply it), then you know that your fingers become discolored after touching things up a bit. There can also be some residue on napkins and such after use (I suppose ladies go through this quite often with lipstick). Either way, I thought I would try the neutral variety to get around this issue... Bad idea.First off, the feel of the neutral is completely different from the chestnut. It's much less creamy and much more tacky. It feels more like hair product than moustache/beard product. Second, the hold is different. It holds much more like hair product as well--very stiff. While this is great for my ends, it's not so great for everything leading up to them. Third, and worst, the white color takes forever to blend in! And even when things have been smoothed out, small bits of white flake remain. Not terribly visible at casual conversation distance, but awful if people are investigating your moustache (as people will do from time to time), you're having a photo, or you simply hate looking like you have dandruff on your upper lip.Words of advice, unless your hair is white (which is a crown of glory, or in this case, a mask of glory...), use the chestnut, brown, or black formulas. Trust me, the trouble of cleaning your hands or smearing isn't nearly as bad as dealing with something that seems more like ""moustache gel.""Clubman is great! Just choose wisely..."

378812,2,"This tub started to leak the 3rd time I used it and it WAS put together properly. The mesh sling is a nice feature, although it tends to smell musty even when thoroughly rinsed after each use. The round bar is rough on the bottom and would be better if it had some sort of padding to protect baby's tender skin. The tub should also have a removable foot stop so baby doesn't just slip down the sling. Holding baby from slipping down the sling makes for a difficult bathtime."

180465,0,"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!"
188956,1,"I picked up this cleaning product at our local dollar store. The clerk picked it up during check-out and she gave it a big thumbs-up. ""These really, REALLY work."" she volunteered. With that enthusiastic recommendation, I took home the Magic Eraser with the idea that I was finally going to get all those smudges off my walls.What is it?The sponge itself is a white block, very light-weight. It is fine-grained, reminiscent of a marshmallow. It contains a cleaner, which you detect as a light dust when the sponge is in its dry form. The sponge is about the size of a regular kitchen sponge.How do you use it?You simply take the sponge out of the package, wet it under the faucet then squeeze out the excess moisture. Now the sponge is ready to use. You rub it on those black marks on the walls (assuming your paint is washable--some paint like flat or whitewash is not washable.) You can rub it on your baseboards, on your stair railings, chair rails, anywhere you get those annoying black marks and finger smudges.How well does this work?The cashier at the dollar store was right! These ARE amazing. Black nasty marks on the wall along the stairs went in a few swipes. The smudges on the enamel rails and baseboards disappeared with a bit of scrubbing. As you use the sponge, it wears out--literally rubbing away into nothingness. When it's gone, it's gone. Go buy another one. I've had this one for months and it's still going strong. If you have kids, it will probably not last so long. But..who cares? This is a lot better than repainting the wall!I also tried it on carpet--it worked ok, but I prefer carpet cleaner for spot cleaning. It was a champ in the shower stall (the fiberglass floor came up really clean!) Excellent for linoleum or vinyl flooring. Takes off those shoe marks.Where shouldn't I use it?The instructions tell you not to use it on glossy or polished surfaces.DownsidesThe more you use it (and you WILL) the faster it disintegrates. If you have kids or are a diligent cleaner, it won't last long. You will really see it go down fast if you do a lot of walls.Also, some reports that paint can become discolored or lighter if you scrub on it, so test this in an area where it doesn't show; your paint may react.SummaryIf you want to remove smudges from your walls and baseboards, cabinets and other painted surfaces, this product is a must-have. It really earns the name Magic Eraser because that is what it does."

In fact it does not ever become ""cold as ice"" in my opinion. If you need it for anything other than very slight injuries or use, fine buy it, but if you have a reoccurring problem as I do, tennis elbow, don't bother, an old-fashioned ice pack will be far more effective.And yes, I left it in the freezer for 24 hours before use.

395857,0,I have heard good things about this product. Since I have only been taking it a few days I can't say it works for thinning hair yet. But I can say it arrived on time as promised.I would like to do another review later to updated you.
325592,0,"Thirty years ago a botched operationfor a deviated septum resultedin a hole punched into the septum.There was no bleeding until abouta year later. The surgeon, aneldery gent, died.

360758,0,"these are thick and durable. I bought for a trip. I was 6 -7 months along, huge all over and 5'3. These are very hard to get on (but this is typical per a friend who has to wear medical compression hose b/c of vein issues)walking through an airport was not fun b/c they kept sagging and by the time I got to the bathroom to pull up, they were halfway down my crotch/thighs. Not a good look....or feeling. I bought a large, too since I was weighing about ~160 or so at the time."
375287,0,"I used this product for about 8 months. The pain became quickly tolerable, but did leave my pores red and inflammed for about 24hrs after each time used. Not good if you want to go bare-legged the day after use. I liked that the regrowth was not nearly as dense (visible) and scratchy as after shaving; however, this doesn't come remotely close to the silky smooth feeling of shaving. I found that I used the gadget fairly often because I didn't like all the &quot;missed&quot; hairs and regrowth. Thus, for me, this became very labor intensive--much more so than shaving. I really missed the silky smoothness from shaving. The biggest downfall for sure was the ingrown hairs-horrible. I use a buff on my body with every daily shower, but this did not seem to help. The bikini area was the worst for ingrown hairs-and they take weeks to work themselves out! Red, swollen, terribly unsightly bumps-NOT attractive! After about 5 months I began getting ingrown hairs on my legs-more than a dozen on each leg. I look like I've been truly eaten alive by bugs! Nasty, nasty, nasty! Unlike bug bites, these are taking WEEKS to resolve. If it weren't for the terrible ingrown hairs, I might have continued to use this product intermittently. So, if you are not prone to getting ingrown hairs then you may like this device. I had no prior history with skin problems (sensitivty, breakouts, ingrown hairs, or razor burn) before using an epilator. I can't wait for all these terrible blemishes to clear up. PS Try this in the Winter!"

157371,2,"I bought this at Walmart just before Xmas. It is junk and not worth $20. It is easy to use and fits most gel and foam cans (not Nivea or the standard foam cans). If you ever went trick or treating as a teenager (you know what I mean) then you can certainly pop the top off the can and put this together. The problems with this thing is:1) The gel does not get warm enough even at its highest setting.2) It cools off to room temp as soon as you get it to your face.If you do not want clutter on your counter then you have to put it away after each use.3) It recommends that you unplug it after and between uses.4) Very hard to clean.This would work great if you could dispense it from the can right onto your face. If you want a warm and great shave, then spend $5 and get a fog free mirror and shave in the shower. If you like to blow money and throwing $20 away is your thing then get this."

81982,0,"My Braun Oral-B recently ran out of steam, so I was looking for a replacement brush. The hydrabrush seems to have the science behind it, and the reviews to support it, so I bought it. Unfortunately, however, I have not been completely satisfied.1) the brushes that came with the hydrabrush were way too short for my front teeth, so I had to purchase the ""extra reach"" brushheads. In my opinion, a pair of extra reach brushheads should be included in every box, so people with longer teeth aren't immediately disappointed by the hydrabrush. The extra reach brushheads are just barely long enough for me, and I don't think my teeth are that big (my two front teeth are 1/2"" long). People with bigger teeth may run into trouble.2) While I love the gum stimulation and the assurance that my gums are being massaged at just the right angle and strength, the surfaces of my teeth are NEVER smooth and clean when I'm done using the hydrabrush, no matter how long I brush. This is a change from the Oral-B; my mouth always felt perfectly clean after using the Braun Oral-B, even when I hadn't used it for the recommended 2 minutes.I will probably keep the hydrabrush and use it once a day, since I feel good about the care it is taking of my gums. However I have ordered a replacement Braun Oral-B, and will be using that once a day to clean up the stuff that the hydrabrush missed."

222142,0,"I was just about to purchase this product as I have been looking for some good chemical-free products but this DOES contain a potentially toxic chemical: Cocamidopropyl betaine. How can it then claim to be chemical free? I am giving it a rating of 3 simply because I HAVE to give a rating, and I am also trying to at least be partially fair because I have not used it. I simply wanted to point out that fact that it is NOT chemical free as advertised."

306864,0,"Helps your posture some but did not do too much for my lower back pain. They say it is easy to use in car etc, but did not find it convenient on cushioned surfaces to adjust as easily. The instructions just talk about sitting on flat wooden chairs, where it is much easier to position yourself and then scooch back so your posture is good, but not so easy on other surfaces. Better for hard chairs and surfaces."
41383,2,"The quick description next to the product photo reads: Comfort your feet in high heels. Anatomical heel cup and arched shape help reduce possible blisters, pump bumps and knee pain. The reviews speak to increasing comfort with high heels. However, the box I received was for ""Women's Flats"". I went back to carefully read the full product description in the middle of the page to find that it states they are for ""low volume"" shoes, ending with ""Recommended footwear: Loafers, lace-ups and casuals shoes without removable insoles."" I don't think they sent me the wrong box because the inserts I received match the ones in the photo for this product. If you go to Superfeet's website and look at the product for high heels, the inserts are much longer and curved differently. Be sure you request the correct product. I'm sure these insoles will feel great in flats, but I'm rating the product low for incorrect statement regarding high heels in the quick description. Wasted my money for something I didn't need."

152577,0,"I have seen friends posting pictures of their salon blowouts, but I am in college and on a strict budget. I was skeptical about using this product when I bought it, but I was excited at the price! About $13 at Walmart. I have long, thick hair that is not especially straight, but it is not curly either. There is just a wave to it that makes it difficult to only air dry, but I hate styling because of all the damage it does. So, here's my experience thus far (treatment has only been in about 3 hours)...- To begin with, I washed my hair with the Keratin shampoo that Organix sells, not the shampoo in the box. I did follow up with the clarifying shampoo that came in the set.- I let my hair air dry as the box recommended, and then I began to apply the Keratin treatment. I have long brown hair, so I twisted my hair into sections to help me stay organized. I applied a somewhat generous amount to my hair in comparison to some of the other reviews I have read, where people say they barely saturated their hair. As I was blowdrying, I did notice a greasiness or ""waxiness"" about my hair. There was also an alarming smoke coming from my hair as I blowdried it. I had my vent running in my bathroom, though, and I also had windows open in the rooms outside of the bathroom. I would not recommend blowdrying without ventilation. It cannot be good for your health.- I flatironed my hair with my CHI flatiron. It is not a digital, so I don't know exactly how hot it was, but it seemed to work fine.- Total, the process took me about 2.5 hours. I would make sure to leave plenty of time in your schedule before you start this process. Be sure to follow the instructions exactly. I can only imagine that they make the instructions for a reason. I read some reviews where girls didn't leave it in for the recommended time period (48 hours), and they regretted it and re-did the process. I plan to leave mine in the total time even though there is a bit of wax build-up (white flakes) showing in my hair and the smell isn't the most pleasant. It's not an unbearable smell, but I am looking forward to washing my hair in a few days. The wax build-up was a little alarming at first, but I'm sure it's just because I put so much in. I ran a comb through my hair several times, and it took a lot of the wax out.- So far, I don't regret using this product. I will update after it has been a few days, and I have washed it out. I will also update at the 30-day mark."
282006,0,This Panasonic facial groomer works fairly well. It doesn't merit being more expensive than any other facial groomers. It works about the same. They should have at least included one battery just to get you started with it. The next time I need to purchase a facial groomer I will purchase one of the cheaper models which are not necessarily made by Panasonic. I felt like I just paid for the name.
49180,0,"Kama Sutra Brahma Lubricant is not my favorite lube. It's a premium priced product with only average lubricating properties. It doesn't have an awful taste. And for the first few minutes of use, it feels really nice. But you will quickly find that it becomes gooey, sticky and ultimately glue-like. The occasional addition of a spritz of water will renew it's slipperyness, but how many times do you really want to stop what you're doing and reach for the spray bottle?ID lube is less expensive and better."
79153,0,"I got this based on the claim that it was all natural. It is, kinda, about as natural as hydrolysis anyway. The ""whey peptides"" are hydrolyzed protein. When you hydrolyze protein containing glutamine you get MSG. No thanks. The online information may not mention that the protein is hydrolyzed but the product label does.EDIT: Changed to 3 stars because the whey peptides are the 3rd ingredient and this product only contains 4 grams of glutamine per serving, only some of which would be from the whey peptides. MSG is a natural & necessary neurotransmitter which only fries brain cells in excessive amounts. Still I think I'll be mixing this powder with another to limit my exposure. People with MSG intolerance need 3 grams or more to notice it and AFAIK they're a good gauge of which restaurants to avoid."

112323,0,"I use Ortho-k contact lenses at night so I cannot have any pressure on my eyes while I sleep. This mask has a nice foam material (inside the lining) which gives a great concave mold so as not to put pressure on the eyes. In general, continued pressure on the eyes is something to avoid so most other sleep masks should be considered as unacceptable to eye health.I would rate this mask 5 stars, but it allows a small amount of light in from the nose area. This light is enough for me to notice and disturb my sleep. However, I do recommend this mask over any other standard mask because this mask puts zero pressure on your eyes, and clearly this mask is better than nothing at all.Additionally, the mask is lightweight and does a great job of blocking light from the side (it is longer than other masks I have tried that require a tight fit to block light from the side). Because the mask is thin and long, you can easily turn your head to either side without the mask shifting which is a plus."
185057,0,The good: it's a handy way to keep sunblock for the kids in the car. I also found my toddler aged kids didn't fuss as much about these vs. regular sunblock.The bad: you don't get very many wipes for the money. They're still somewhat messy (though not quite as messy as a bottle of sunblock).If you live somewhere where you need a lot of sunblock this isn't for you. If you have a case where you only need it occasionally and looking for a lower mess options this would be a good choice.

I could barely walk and was in considerable discomfort, my knee badly inflammed and swollen.I put it on in the parking lot (that's how easy they are to apply) and, I swear, 10 minutes later there was a definite improvement, although my husband claims that the smell of them makes his eyes water. The smell isn't unpleasant, but it is ""distinctive.""After 24 hours of use, I can actually walk fairly normally without pain. The knee is still swollen, but I am much more comfortable.Whoda thought?My husband says it's all in my head. Hey, if that's true, they still work for me!I would recommend these to anyone to try.

114483,0,"I have traditionally been a regular razor guy, but from time to time I try an electric shaver with terrible results. This time I chose the Braun 1775. The upside is that this is the first shaver that didn't rip the hairs out of my neck and it ultimately leaves me with a reasonably decent shave. Now the downside. First, I've only had this shaver for a little more than a month, and the foil screen already has a hole/tear in it. I have found it takes me numerous passes over most of my face and neck, and even then it misses quite a few hairs. I have found that I have to shave with a razor at the start of the week and I can use the Braun to maintain my shave during the week. I am not exceptionally picky about having a skin-close shave, so it is acceptable for me.Overall, if you are a die-hard electric shaver fan, I would recommend a different shaver. It's better than any other I have used, but somewhat disappointed me."

Everyone talks about the cleaning stand which I also agree is very neat and does a good job of cleaning the razor, but the problem is neck hair. If you look at any of the consumer bulletin boards, you'll see the same complaint over and over. This thing simply doesn't trim long hair that runs flat at the neck line (or for that matter any long hairs). You must use the beard trimmer to get these and that really doesn't work well either. The other minor complaint is that this that this thing is VERY loud. Shaving around the sideburn area close to your ear is just uncomfortable because the razor is so loud (not to mention waking up your wife early in the morning). Finally (a minor minor thing) is that the cleaner cycle throws a mist or smell in the air of cleaner fluid (alcohol like) that I don't really like the smell of. Some many like it so this is no real big deal, but it is there."
94350,0,"I've suffered from various symptoms of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome my whole life, and was diagnosed about eight months ago during an impressive and ongoing flare-up. I found Fibro-Response while searching for ""fibromyalgia"" on Amazon. Based on the positive reviews and the relatively low price, I was willing to give them a try.I give these vitamins three stars. My fibro has not disappeared and I don't really feel any better after taking these vitamins for about six weeks, but, I don't feel any worse either. According to my fibro doctor and dietician, people with fibro are often deficient in B vitamins, magnesium, malic acid and the like, and since these pills have all those ingredients and more, they certainly provide some potential benefit for fibro people. And considering that my fibro doctor's office sells their own brand of vitamins with nearly identical ingredients - but requiring taking an entire PACK of pills a day, and costing nearly $100 for a 30-day supply - these vitamins are quite cost-effective for the potential benefit they provide. As I'm sure others with chronic conditions can relate, I hate having to spend so much money just dealing with my condition (doctor visits, prescription drugs, physical therapy, massage etc.) so it's nice to see a decent product that doesn't break the bank.However, I do take off two stars because, as I said, I don't actually feel better, but also because these pills are HUGE. I am no stranger to swallowing handfuls of pills at a time, but these do not go down easily. They also taste and smell pretty terrible. Taking three of these pills a day can be a bit of a burden. I'd like to see them in powder- or drink mix-form."

422557,0,"I bought the SBM-200 as a gift for my wife after she tried it at a local store and loved it. After getting it and using it, I noted a few things about these units to be aware of.The upper back and lower back programs also massage the mid back. I wish there was a way to limit the movement to only the lower or upper back, and have a separate program for mid back instead of the demo mode button.There are 3 zippers on the back near the upper and lower seat fold, and 1 zipper on the seat bottom. Unfortunately, the zipper bodies have sharp metal edges and the seat cover does not have flaps to cover them, so they might damage the upholstery of your chair. The instruction manual warns of this, and says not to use it on wooden chair surfaces. I placed a folded towel underneath the unit to protect my leather recliner. This slightly adds to the height and further reduces the depth of the seating area.The seat bottom does nothing at all except for being a cushion and a holder for the wired handheld remote.The unit is not comfortable to sit on when not in use. However it is somewhat clunky to remove, transport, and store with the 12 ft of power cable, transformer (which sits on the floor), and the various seat fastening straps.Given these facts, the slightly shorter SBM-100 might be a better and more economical choice. Since the SBM-100 does not have a bottom seat cushion, it offers some leeway in positioning the unit against your back.Homedics also offers the slightly more expensive SBM-300 and QRM-400 which feature rolling massage, adjustable massage width, and the ability to hold the massage heads at a specific point. The SBM-300 also has vibrating seat massage while the QRM-400 has 4 heads. Adjustable width is nice as I feel the SBM-200 massages too close to my spine.Note that all of these units have the sharp zipper bodies. Homedics should really redesign them to use velcro or position the zippers on the sides and top where it won't contact and damage the chair.They should also try to package the power transformer into the back cushion to make it easier to transport and store.I opened the zippers and took a peek inside the back. It is mostly plastic. A single motor rides on a track and simultaneously drives the 2 rotating nylon heads. The gears are nylon. Limit switches on the track determine the points at which the motor reverses for each of the programs. Each head has two ""nubs"" which do the massaging. The heads rotate against a thin nylon cover. A vinyl flap covers the nylon cover. The massage action feels pretty good, but it is hardly ""state of the art"" and I hope it lasts. The manual warns against putting your weight on the heads while they're in motion."

I tried washing the existing pads with soap and water and with alcohol to remove any oil. I also tried slightly scratching the existing pads to roughen the surface but nothing helped to keep the Peach Nose Pads stuck on them. Other ratings have warned of this but I was despirate to find something that would prevent the slipping. It gets expensive to continue to purchase lots of packages of them. I only use them for important functions where I need something sort of invisible. Otherwise I use the only methods that work - Crookies Tite End eyewear retainers which has a sliding bead that pulls them tite behind your head (a bit ugly) and the Flents Sports Band Elastic Eyeglass Holder for Active People (a bit tight and hard to get on and ugly). With these two products pulled tight, my eyeglasses never slip."

The motor is strong and the trimmer is sharp. It consistently cuts the hairs easily. I clean out the hair-catching area of the trimmer, about every month or so. This helps keep the trimmer running well, I notice if it collects too much hair in there then the motor struggles a bit. I've been using it for almost a year, and it still performs the way it did that first day I turned it on. Surprisingly well made trimmer for the price. Definitely recommend."

I bought three boxes of protein bars because I'm currently dieting and always on the go. I also bought luna sunrise bars which i loved!! And clif mojo bars which was my 2nd fave.These chocolate raspberry bars are ok. The texture is a little weird, it has a fake chocolate taste, and the raspberry taste is pretty light. But I did appreciate that the raspberry's seemed fresh because of the seeds from them in the bars. They are not horrible but if you're looking for good taste and not just a diet bar, I'd go for luna or clif."

75719,0,I really only liked the lemon ones. They had a mildy soothing effect on the nausea. Only lasted as long as the candy though. All the other flavors made me feel even more nauseated. I am sure if I wasn't pregnant all the flavors would taste good to me. But with the pregnancy I only liked the lemon. I tried really hard to find a Preggie Pops pack that ONLY had lemon. No dice. They have several flavors offered with only a single flavor but not lemon. They should offer each flavor as a separate Item for purchase.

My husband thought the house was going to shake down and it was so NOT relaxing. Even on the low setting, the force of the bubbles and the noise was unsettling. Also, one thing to note is that the mat does NOT heat the water, so the bath water cools down quickly when using the spa (this is stated in the instruction manual as well). Overall, I'm dissapointed because it is not as I expected. But when you're in the mood for a quasy jacuzzi this product gets you half the way there."

113619,2,"Experiment FailedOne day, after using a regular ""old-fashion"" razor-blade shaving, I decided to try Braun shaver. Well, it is not like I never tried electrical shavers before. I've had Phillips rotating-cutter shavers. Knowing for sure that none of tese electrical shavers could beat a razor blade (meaning that I did not even try to compare razor with electrics), I was still quite disappointed with Braun product in comparison with other types of electrical shavers.Here are the problems:The foil seems to be having holes that are too small, so the hair (especially on under the chin, neck area) does not get caught into the foil, so the vibrating blade has nothing to cut. After shaving with Braun, I get many places on my face with this single uncaught hairs sticking here and there. It looks weird.The shaving takes forever and it requires many passes over the same area. I have to shave twice (!) a day, otherwise my face looks like if I did not bother shaving at all.I should say, if I ever use electric shavers again, I will get a rotary-type. It will not be as smooth as a razor blade shaving, but at least, I would not have uncaught and uncut hairs on my face)."

Maybe it would work better if I wanted to spend a half hour shaving, running it back and forth, up and down my face but I don't really have that kind of time. The person who said that it shaves as good as a blade must not have used a blade in a long time because after using the ShavePro, I finished off with a blade and my face is no longer bristled. Don't waste your money on this unless you want to buy it as a toy for a child who wants to shave like daddy."

It's peels your skin and you can feel the tingling when applied, your skin to peel within couple of days if follow directions. Then a light scrubbing. But what I found out works quicker is to cut a thin slice to lime and rub in on the wart and using the lime skin as exfolient. Because what a wart is is that it lives on the top layer of the skin forming a skin matrix (due to abnormal growth). So basically this medicine intended to gently wear down the matrix gradually, but I didnt have time. I wanted it gone and quick, so the lime works from just two days to use, though I did draw blood breaking down the food supply of the wart (capillaries)."

86345,0,I have to say I started this therapy on Oct. 20th this year and I have seen very little difference in my skin. I have done this every single day for 15-20 min each time. I still get breakouts everyday and the ones that I have the light does not seem to calm them down or take the reddness away. I am giving it a 3 star because I have still not given it the recommened 2 months so I guess I will pray for a miracle in the next month and see what happens. The plus to this is that it has the money back gaurantee and it is so quiet you don't even know it is on. If this does not work then it is Accutane or Laser treatment for me.
