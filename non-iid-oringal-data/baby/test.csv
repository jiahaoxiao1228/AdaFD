90120,1,"We have been using these for about 4 months on our 9 month old boy. We use these at night or when we think(hope) he is going down for a nice nap. These are nice because they are more flexible than the swaddlers and accept more ""stuff"" than them as well. They are larger and more restricting in movement than the swaddles but that's why they're ideal for sleep time. Also, they are not always available at our local target, especially in this large quantity. Glad these are made and that we have them!"
15003,2,"These bottles are pathetic and the company's failure to acknowledge they have a problem with leaking is an admission they don't care about their customers. Beware -- at least 50% of the bottles will require multiple efforts of tightening to avoid leaking. I wish I could perform at a 50% success rate in my job and be paid a premium to do so. That being said, if your baby eats from these and nothing else, you'll deal with the frustration. I would recommend these only after exhausting other higher quality and lower cost options out there."
120339,1,"Just the right height for the toilet, good as a step up to a higher stool for teeth brushing. Sturdy, light, nice looking, comfortable. My little boy loves the stickers on it and the color. He's 2 and he can move the stool to the toilet and sink as needed by himself. I have never seen it's equal. It even works in the shower when I need to clean him up in a hurry."
162182,2,"I bought this tub hoping my twin boys would use it until they were 2, as stated on the label.well, the suction cup that stabilizes the tub pulled out and it started leaking.It also leaked on me several times before it actually broke.NOT AS DURABLE AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AFTERALL."
45187,1,"I got this as a present for my baby shower and my daughter who is now 2 months old LOVES this thing. She likes the colors, the sounds and the toys hanging from above. Even our dogs love it, and unfortunately can't keep them away long enough to co-exist harmoniously with the baby. (She hates getting licked.)It's also easy to throw this in the wash, you can remove the sound pad and the bars. Everything is attached by snap buttons so it's very easy to put everything back together.Buy it, it's worth it."
53451,1,We have a small place so this is great for a grandchild that visits. It is secure and lets the baby sit up to the table or counter with the rest of us.
121230,1,"My son loved this seat from day one. He likes it much more than even his crib. The vibrating + music calms him most of the time and he sleeps in it for hours.The downside's the available music and amount of time that the unit runs. There is only 1 ""meddly"" available. The ""runtime"" before the vibrating/music stops is about 15 minutes. After that you have to cycle the power for it to start again. Three C batteries last about 2-3 weeks with moderate usage."
92550,1,an inexpensive essential for any new mom - just to see how easy it is to not buy prepared baby food
16413,0,"I bought them for $5.00 at the baby sale about a year ago and that was fine, but this new price is insane."
162778,1,"Of all the things I bought that I found I did NOT need with my first baby, this is one product that is inexpensive and so worth it! Before I bought these, I used Take N Toss Snack cups with lids and my child would just dump it out once she figured out how to turn the lid to the open position. Then I switched to Ziplocs and of course, crackers and Cheerios went everywhere. So then, I tried this and barely a cracker gets out! Helps me keep my car and house clean! YAY!****UPDATE*** My child is now 20 months old and crafty. She has reached a point where she occasionally takes off the lid and dumps her snacks if she's not supervised. Even so, I still HIGHLY recommend this product!!!"
30443,0,"I got this at my baby shower. I like the hammock idea and she loves the toys. The only thing i dont like is the hump in the middle. It is good when you are using the hammock, but in three months when you take the hammock out, it seems like it would hurt a baby's back because it is hard and only holds the baby's mid back. So my daughter either has to sit above the hump which only allows her shins to be in the water or i have to hold her in the lower area. I just wish it was reclined instead of a bulky plastic hump in the middle of her back."
88740,1,"We used Pampers Swaddlers up until my son outgrew them. We were sad because we LOVED the Swaddlers but ""graduated"" to the Cruisers. We were really dissappointed as most every morning we awoke with a what we refer to as a ""breach of security."" And i don't mean just a little spot but full on have to change our sheets and sometimes even my clothing (we co-sleep.)I didn't even know about the Baby Dry diapers until one time we ran out of Cruisers and hubby brought these home from the store. I've got to say that these are fantastic diapers and our nighttime leaks happen maybe once or twice a month (and I think that might have something to do with my husband putting the diaper on a little... askew.)And speaking of... I'm wondering if maybe some of the negative reviews are from folks who maybe aren't putting the diaper on well (occasionally) or more likely, they need to go up a size perhaps. I know when we were trying to use up size 3 Baby Dries we had enough leaks that we just gave them away to a friend and went right up size 4. Anywho, just a thought... we LOVE these diapers though."
146156,1,"Our grandchild was 5 months and her feet didn't reach the ground, even at the lowest setting. So we placed a 2"" lap tray on the tile floor. She uses it to place her feet.She really likes the F.P.R.Jumperoo. She loves to touch the toys in front and she likes to look at the higher ones too. She likes the little bounces she gets when she bends her knees. I think this is a very well designed and made toy. The music is not constant and it's lively without being annoying to us older folks. I recommend it."
37539,2,"This is absolutely the WORST gate I have ever bought and wish I had never laid eyes on it! The thing falls off the wall because it is METAL and far too heavy for the PLASTIC parts used to ""secure"" it to the wall, it does not close and latch properly, is easily pushed or pulled open even by my little 15-month-old, and the ""lock"" (also plastic) snapped off after only 1 week of use, so it will not even stay locked now. The hinges used to hold it onto the wall do not stay clamped together and when you lift it to swing it open, it pops right off and the springs go flying and the gate falls to the floor. I agree, if this could be given negative ratings, I sure would do it!!!"
182293,1,"Having tried both the 2-sided changing pad and this 4-sided one, I think this 4-sided one wins me over. They're probably both equally secure, but this one makes ME feel safer because the four sides make it harder for my baby to wiggle out. This vinyl pad doesn't require a cover, but I use one anyway. The length would serve us well when my son grows."
177028,1,"We looked high and low for a gate to close off the 96"" opening to a room now known as the playroom. We found this gate at both Babies R Us and Lowes, and it is worth every penny. Very easy to install and sturdy. My 32 lb, 13 month son likes to stand and pull on it, but nothing has ""given"" so far. It is made of quality materials and I would purchase it again or recommend it in a heartbeat."
81690,2,Static Static and more Static. This should be taken off the market. They are useless....
124787,1,"My daughter loves this walker. She has tried to play with other walkers but got scared off because they were too unstable. This one is very sturdy so she can pull up on it and really use it to support her. The adjustable braking system really helps too. She is 12 mos and just starting to walk and she enjoys practicing with this. I can see her playing with this for years to come. And with its rounded edges, our furniture will last too! It is definitely worth the price."
172117,1,My little guy loves to take a bath in this tub! Mine came with a hammock (not pictured) that gives him some stability &amp; security. He just lies in the water and looks around. It makes bath time fun!
119941,0,"My daughter is only two months old, so she isn't quite old enough to really play with these things. She can reach out and grab or smack the toys, and when she is in a good mood will laugh at them, but it doesn't entertain her for long. I LOVE that they are plush and can be taken apart to use as stuffed toys as well. The toys don't make noise and are very simple, but the price was outstanding. I paid only 15 dollars on Amazon for this gym, while most others were upwards of 40 dollars!"
2663,2,"I have been using pampers swaddlers with dry max since my twins were born and love them! I can count on 1 hand the number of ""blow outs"" and leaks. I use subscribe and save and my item was unavailable for the previous purchase price. I decided to try these. I thought they also had dry max since they said baby dry. I am now having at least one leaky diaper every morning and have had 3 diapers I had to throw away because the tabs tore. This has never happened. My twins are one and in size 3 diapers. I have tried the cruisers which seem to be ok. I'm not sure if it is just the lot I have or this line of diapers. I may have to go back to the cruisers since the swaddlers are not made in large sizes."
69759,0,My daughter has destroyed the cover for this chair. She managed to pull off each of the elastic attachments so it no longer secures to the chair itself. We still use it regularly but I wish there were replacement covers.
117771,1,this jumper was easy to assemble. We bought it to have on hand when the grandbabiesvisit. We found that it fits nicely in the doorway. I also noticed that the clothpart is easy to remove and clean. We have used it a few times and it has a nice bounce to it. It is also easy to store when not in use.
29150,1,This is working great for us. We use it as a step stool for climbing into bed. It's light and portable- yet sturdy. I love the colors!
178654,1,"This product is great and so easy to get it set-up..I don't leave home without it. Easy to clean, and most important my baby loves it. This is a must!!!"
7978,1,"This gym is amazing! My 3-month-old spends hours looking at her hands grabbing at the arch and at the toys. All she wants to do is play with this gym, during every waking hour! I don't know what she would have done without it! Clearly it is teaching her something that she is right at the age to learn."
89228,1,"This is by far the best diaper ever!!! I love Pampers! I've tried others and my son always leaked out of them, but with Pampers Baby Dry, it's happened maybe twice in the last 6 months! Although expensive, they are so worth my son not leaking out! In this case, you really do get what you pay for."
22994,1,My grandson lives in another state and I send diapers to him every month. These are the best diapers for the money. No problems with leaky diapers.
107192,1,"I did a lot of research before I bought a diaper pail and this is what I ended up with. Boy am I glad I did! the handle is very easy to flip even with a baby in hand. We use the inexpensive, scented garbage bags in the pail and they seem to work very well. We do have to change the bag about 2 times a week but it is all worth it from the horror stories I have heard from owners of the &quot;other&quot; pail. There is no smell at this point but I am told that some sort of smell is inevitable whenever she starts on solids. All in all it is worth the money!"
178926,1,"This works awesome. It's clear there's no issue using the remote while the shield is ""in use."" This keeps my son's little fingers (and all of his random toys) out of the disk tray."
157678,2,"I've had this bed now for about 9 mos. It is a beautiful looking bed and the price is great. However, the drawer is already not functional, it was hard for my husband to put together and the support slats for the matress are flimsy. Two have already broken. I have a younger daughter that I was planning on handing this down to but will not be able to. If you only have one child that will be using the bed for a short time it is a good deal. Otherwise, I would spend a little more money for a higher quality bed."
128646,1,"this is a nice pad. i liked the price and the feel. however, when my son's diaper leaked, it went through the pad and wet the mattress. luckily, the mattress has a waterproof cover too.otherwise, it's a good buy."
31707,2,This bottle brush fell apart after a few weeks of use. I have the Dr. Brown's bottles and was only washing 1-2 bottles/day. Waste of money.
162918,0,"These drawers pretty to look at, but cheaply made and very hard to assemble. It took over 5 hours to get this one together. Right out of the box there were scratches and scuffs, which wasn't very nice. Overall I do like the drawers,I think the price is a bit high for what you get."
23834,0,"I love putting my 2 week old in this sleepsack because it is so soft and cozy to touch. It fits my newborn well and I hope it will fit for another month or two. There are 2 downsides: First, there is a little too much fabric so that it can get unwieldy when changing his diaper. Even though the zipper unzips from the bottom supposedly for easier diaper changing, it is not easy because there is so much fabric that it's hard to get the new diaper underneath the baby. I end up having to take off the whole sleepsack anyway. Second, the fabric can be too thick/warm. I would get the cotton version next time and dress the baby in layers if necessary."
126054,1,"I bought these because I thought it was a better deal and value than just buying the smaller bags and boxes all the time. I am glad I got it, it has lasted a long time and I will be buying it again."
75841,1,"I wanted a nice car seat mat to protect my new leather car seats. This item is well made, appears very durable, and is appropriately sized. The only caution I have is one of my car seats tends to slide somewhat on this mat. I chose to use both the seat belt, and the buckles that attach to the special U-hooks built into the seat.The mat is supposedly water resistant, but I don't know how that will work as my kid tends to launch his sippy cup.Overall, the item exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend it."
136076,1,Gives me the peace of mind that I need for my premature girl. Speedy delivery. Thank you! Definately will recommend to others.
111059,0,"This nursing cover works great and it's nice looking. I would love it if it weren't for the fact that the material doesn't breathe. I live in Hawaii, it's warm, so when I feed my baby I feel like I'm in an oven. It gets uncomfortably hot and by the time my baby finishes eating he's all hot and sweaty. This cover is good for cooler environments."
19970,1,"Unless you expect a suction cup to work as well as crazy glue, you'll probably be very happy with these bowls. Obviously, the stick better on plastic and smooth surfaces, and they stick better if you wet the suction cup. One review said that she licked the rim, but I just wet my finger or run the bottom of the bowl under the sink. If they stuck too well, I would think it would be frustrating when you want to move it and have to get a fingernail under there or something. To the reviewer who said that it is probably a better idea just to train your child not to throw things on the floor, I say, that's the right idea.On the flip side, the bowls really help kids learn to spoon feed since they can scoop things up the side of the bowl. Having a relatively deep bowl is important for that. One problem with the bowls is when you are at a restaurant and the high chair is not very high in comparison to the table so the child is peering over the edge of the bowl.I use them with the sassy spoons with the handles that curve up like a hill. My 17 month old can eat cereal with milk using those spoons with these cups and most of it goes into her mouth!"
150849,1,"Color true to description and picture. Good quality, smooth drawer slides. Taller than I thought but I should have paid more attention to dimensions! Overall worth the money."
169442,1,"This bag is exactly what I was hoping that it would be. It's sturdy, roomy, convenient, and cool. I registered us for this so that my husband would have a diaper bag that he would not only be willing to wear, but be excited to wear!!! He absolutely loves it and it makes him feel like the best and coolest daddy on the block!!!"
67120,0,"I really like everything about this stroller except for the music on the go feature (the main reason I bought this stroller). All I can hear is the background singers, you can't hear the main song. Also, the speakers are pointed directly at my daughter, so the volume has to be fairly low to keep from blasting her ears, and therefore makes it difficult for me to hear. Love the rest of the stroller though!"
124371,1,I read some reviews suggesting that it is simple to just lift both toilet lid and seat I do not agree. There is a latch that actually goes inside the toilet bowl so that is not possible. My 15 month old son can not lift the lid and has actually lost interest in even trying. It is simple for me to open so no struggle when ya gotta go! I give this the full stars it deserves!
5902,2,"Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing 5 packs of these. Flimsy, cheap plastic with razor sharp edges. They serve to store the cords but there's no way to wind them. Misleading, indeed. I'm going to return these."
98028,1,"These are grest if you are breastfeeding and need to go back to work. I used another type of bottle with my first son and after I went back to work, he would want to bottle instead. With my second, we give him bottles during the day and I feed him before and after work. Get a bottle brush as these are rather tall and thin. They are also dishwasher safe on the top rack. Just clean the nipple by hand!"
100156,2,We Liked the swaddlers. Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
28102,0,"You can buy a 4-pack of refills w/ a regular tub and travel tub at Coscto for $19.99. I really like Huggies Supreme in the red bag, but this is all they had. The idea of a scented wipe is great, until you have anything but a wet diaper. The smell of a poopy and this cucumber w/ green tea is enough to make me gag....I don't plan on buying scented wipes again!"
166450,1,"Good diapers. High price, would use store brand instead. Small babies don't pee that much, so save money and buy cheaper diapers."
28111,1,I really like the idea of my husband and others being able to find the right clothes size. In my sons closet I know how everything is orgnized but my husband doesn't so my son is always wearing a shirt that is too big for him. Now we wont have that problem with our little girl. I didn't care for the lables so we made our own.
88264,0,This bag was just OK. I found it to be too skinny to be practical as a diaper bag.
8548,1,"So far, my 9 month old hasn't tried to pull this off. It seems pretty stuck with the tape they gave you. It has stuck really well onto our fireplace (which is small, square, not totally even tile) for 2 weeks now. This brand is MUCH better than the Cosmos brand, also sold here on Amazon. The corners fit better, and the tape works a lot better."
94189,1,"My baby loved this from the time we got it for her at 4 months (she just sat in it at first, but liked being upright on her own). She was walking at 11 months so I don't think it had any negative developmental impact. Watch it in a narrow doorway though - little fingers can get pinched once they can reach over the tray. Good item and good price."
136574,1,"I was little sceptical about buying this bumper after reading the reviews on-line, but it's just fine and I like it. It doesn't smell funny, it is a nice green color and it does the job. It's nothing over the top, but a great bumpoer for the price."
22369,1,"The Pack N Play Playard is fine. This was a baby shower gift, and the box this came in was embarrassing."
143856,1,This one is really beautiful and useful. And my daughter's stokke stays really nice with this one. When it's very sun it's nice to use it...
28264,2,"I may have received a ""lemon,"" but my experience with this chair so far is poor. Several pieces in the box were significantly damaged (large dents and deep, long scratches in the wood, one of the cushions was separating at the seams) and I spent 20 minutes on hold with the company to get replacement parts in ""maybe 15-30 days - if they have them""...As far as comfort, the chair is alright... Just remember - you get what you pay for. If you don't mind a chair that may arrive damaged, screws that don't line up correctly - basically a cheap product that was made in China, then this chair is for you. If you want something that is sturdy and built to last, I would look into higher end gliders made by another manufacturer (Dutalier, Best Chair, etc.)."
150880,1,"We purchased this to go on top of the Beatrice dresser/changing station for my son. It's beautiful. Yes, it does need to be assembled, but we didn't have any trouble with that. My husband was able to do it all by himself and he's not mechanically inclined at all.The wood finish is very smooth and beautiful. We liked it so much, we purchased another one for our second son's room."
112377,1,I bought this item with the 30$ off for 100$ pampers coupon. I like and have been using Pampers for my daughter for long time.
43136,1,"We were unsure whether this is a good item because of other critical reviews here - however, we found it most convenient for our uses. It steers very easily - perfect on mall floors, and very well on the street. The only drawback are hard plastic wheels, but we have used it for 3 months by now, and it hasn't been a major problem.We put it in the trunk of our car, so wherever we go, we always have a stroller with us."
164829,1,"One thing I can state about diapers as a mother of 2 and a grandmother of 1 is that you can NEVER go by the poundage shown for the diaper fit. My experience has been that the children go into the size well BEFORE they are in the poundage recommended. I have also found that it really depends on the build of the child as to which brand works best for them. We have tried the major brands on our granddaughter and found that PAMPERS works best for her and we have no leakage problems.Pampers Baby Dry Diapers, Size 6, 128-Count"
54455,1,"I have two mobiles, one with a light show for my daughters crib and this one for her cradle in the living room. she is 2 months old. in the mornings after eating she is fussy until i set her down to watch her little friends. she could be crying in my arms but as soon as she hears the soothing music she is all smiles, she will watch this until its her time to take a nap.she prefers this one over the one in her crib for fun but at night she likes to relax with the light show.this only complaint i have is the music shuts off. i wish it would stay on till i decided. but it plays for a good 15-20 minutes.i payed around 30 for mine new. i see on hear 100.00. i think that is high but if i had to pay that i would. just happy i didnt."
11031,1,"Bought this for my granddaughter who is 18 months old. Arrived in a timely fashion, and it was exactly what I had envisioned.."
52365,1,Use these if you're too busy for a diaper change during dinner.
80382,2,"When we first bought this faucet cover, I was so excited. It was adorable and my son loved it. It was quite tricky to get on our faucet at first, but eventually I got it on. It was a tight fit and definitely a problem when we have guests in town. However, after only 4 months, now we can't get it to stay on! The rubber has apparently loosened up to the point that it will not stay snug on the faucet. When we first turn the water on, it's fine, but by the time it gets warm from the water, the whole thing pops off. So annoying! :( Looking for a new one."
25724,0,"Once my son got into the ""oral stage,"" (around 3 months) he began to chew on EVERYTHING and the doctor recommended starting him on a sippy cup at 4 months. This was the only cup st Babies R Us that was labeled as young as 4 months and I noticed it had a soft tip so I thought we'd give it a try. My son loved chewing on it more than actually drinking out of it. At the time, he would not take a pacifier, but would chew on this, and everything else but the paci. He is now 7 months and no longer uses it (and hasn't for a while), this is what we concluded:Pros: * suitable for a 4 month old learning to hold a cup* good for teething* no leaks if child throws it aroundCons: * impossible to line up handles with spout* hard to drink from (liquid will come out when chewed on, but the spout has to be completely in child's mouth)** Yes, I would recommend this item **"
158499,1,"I am so happy with the sleep sack!! I ordered it b/c I had to ween my 4 1/2 month old son off his swaddle garment since he was flipping on his stomach. I was concerned that he might be getting cold at night without the swaddle since we keep the air at 72. He was waking up 4-5 times a night over the past couple of weeks and my husband and I were having a really rough time. The first night he used the sleep sack he slept 9 hours straight and then another 3 hours after a quick feeding. Tomorrow will be a week that he has slept this same routine every night!! I would recommend this garment to everyone I know. The quality is great, the cotton is soft and most importantly it is keeping my baby happy and warm at night."
36625,1,This car seat has (for the most part) been great! At nine months our little girl still fits in it quite well. She has been very comfortable in it. We never found it to be too tight for her or difficult to get her in and out. We have gotten many complements on the pattern as well. The big complaints that we have had have been: getting the handle up (a major pain!) and that the metal piece that holds the straps in the back getting caught on the holder for the manual (making it difficult to tighten the straps properly!). Because of these two things we have decided to upgrade to a convertible car seat before she has out grown the SnugRide. We will keep the SnugRide in my husbands car in case of an emergency...but for everyday its out!
29886,2,"I bought this pump after I read the reviews on this site. It did not perform as well as I thought it would. It is complicated and difficult to put together. It doesn't have extra parts except the storage container. Which means you have to wash it after everytime you use it. So pumping several times a day is a hassle. I have a fast flow and it still takes me like over 10 minutes to pump one ounce! I personaly don't have that much extra time. It is not very comfortable to use either, actually it hurts. Save your money and buy an electric Medella on E-bay or at a consignment shop."
115833,0,"Overall it is good. Kid seems comfortable in it. I kick the wheels in a full stride. I don't think my wife does though. The basket is a bit hard to use, small gap to slide stuff in. Good construction and quality materials used."
83004,1,"This simple product is a must have for anyone using a BOB in cold climates. It is simple to install and makes a big difference in the warmth of your child. It is also very soft and makes the seat more comfortable. I have used a warm fuzzy and rain shield to keep my boy warm while running the past two Michigan winters. This combo keeps him warm and dry in all weather, including snowy/windy days as cold as 25 degrees. It's also great for standard use due to the increased comfort."
40533,0,I decided to give these diapers a try. They are great and my son seems very comfortable in them. However I will stick with Pampers Snug and Dry as I get more for my money with them. The cruisers are too expensive.
69958,2,"...and simply have the next diaper ready to go. We put the new one on top of the old, unfastened, and then quickly take out the dirty one. There is enough stuff for a baby. You don't need this.P.S. I wanted to give this 0 stars, but I wasn't allowed to do so."
174854,1,"I received a different nail clipper as a baby shower gift. It had a plastic cover over the top of the cutting end of the clipper, similar to this one, but with a plain white handle instead of the cute bumble bee:Sassy: Bumble Bee Nail Clippers. It was terrible. I couldn't see my baby's finger nails at all and it wasn't sharp enough.Then I used this Safety 1st Nail Clipper at my mother's house. It was so much easier to use than the other one. The size is perfect for her little fingers. I could easily see my baby's nails and clip them without fear of cutting her. The handle fits nicely in my hand. And the blade is sharp enough to cut the nail off in one clip. I bought one for myself and it's the only one I'll use now."
177451,1,"I work full-time and bought this pump to use at work when I didn't have access to our lactation room which has an electric double pump. It was inexpensive and I thought that I could even use the black case after I didn't use the pump anymore. I use the Isis pump exclusively now due to how well it works. I've been pumping for a month now, and couldn't be more pleased.It has no noise, causes no discomfort at all, is not tiring to use (being a hand-pump), and cleans easily. It's so discreet that I pump in the privacy of my car in the parking garage. I listen to music while using the pump and just throw a towel over me when someone walks by. There are about 5 pieces, but once you've taken it apart and reassembled it, it's a cinch to do. I manage to get about 4oz in about 20 minutes off one breast. Maybe the electric pumps are faster, but my son only eats about 4oz, so it's perfect for me.I never use the included blue ice packs- they thawed out after about 2 hours. However, there is a mesh pocket inside the black case which is big enough to hold a bag of frozen veggies that I use as my ice pack. I've even brought my lunch to work with me in this case. It's not huge, but it holds my pump, one bottle (I pump, then pour the milk into storage bags for freezing), a soda and sandwich.I gave it only 4 stars because you need a bit of trial-and-error to get it to work well for you. Things that helped me:1) Remove the petal shield and pump cover. The shield just fills with air and does not give adequate suction, and the shield is just unecessary.2) When putting the pump together make sure the tiny white valve is *completely* pushed in. I noticed a lot of air comes in when this isn't flush with the pump.3) DON'T screw the pump onto the bottle as tight as it will go. This will cause cracks and isn't necessary.4) Pump the same way as your baby would suck- hold a little pressure (meaning don't squeeze the handle down completely), hold for a few seconds, and release.5) Finally, I release the suction on my breast after pumping a few times; I don't keep the suction going for more than a few minutes. Then I restart pumping, build the suction again, express for a about 10 seconds, and break the suction again. (just pull the side of your nipple away from the pump. Don't pull the pump away.) This makes sure that the milk doesn't build up under the silicone diaphragm (the piece that the handle connects to) and it allows for greater ""let-down"". I noticed that my son releases my nipple frequently during nursing- this mimics his behavior. I hope it works as well for you!"
11889,1,"This is really a wonderful product! My 6 month old son uses his all the time.I found an easy way to clean the mesh part that I would like to share with every one. First- remove any large pieces of pulp or food left inside- don't worry about scrubbing it out or removing all the food. Second- mix 1/4 a scoop of an oxi-clean type cleaner with hot water in glass cup. Third- put the mesh bag in the glass- ring side up (you can hold it down with a spoon). Wait about 10 minutes. Pull the mesh bag out- rinse and clean with regular dish washing soap. Air dry. Mesh bag comes out sparkling white (so will your glasses if you have hard water stains!). The food simply disolves. Works really well with bananas!!!! No more brown colored mesh. No more time spent trying to pull small bits of food out from the mesh edges or from around the ring.Now what to feed baby- everything but pudding and ice cream! Bananas, plums, peaches, melon, chicken, cooked carrots, potatoes, you name it. No grinding food, don't have to spend extra money on jars of baby food. This little gadget is GREAT!"
96313,2,"my son loves these cups, but they are difficult to clean, they get moldy fast and he easily chews the rubber straw off. I had to purchase 10 on here because he destroys them so quickly. Also, he has smashed a could just throwing them and the actual bottle breaking. But because he loves them so much I have to keep buying lol."
24301,2,Just received my mini co-sleeper sheet. Will return it. I did not notice but it's 65% polyester. I myself would never choose to sleep on a poly sheet. Why should my baby? Hardly anything could be better than cotton for a baby's sheet!.
156772,1,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY SON WHO IS 6 MONTHS OLD. IT WAS A LIFE SAVER. I CAN LEAVE HIM IN IT AND DO MY HOUSE WORK I COULD NEVER DO BEFORE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE HELD, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT AND I RECOMMEND IT TO ANY BODY WHO IS THINKING ABOUT INVESTING IN ONE OF THESE. IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY HE LOVES PLAYING WITH IT."
20357,1,"I have a 6 month old that loves this pig. She doesn't really care for the coins yet, because she can't really hang on to them that well, but she hugs the pig and chews on his ears. I leave a coin inside so he rattles. He's brightly colored and extremely cute. She started playing with him at around 5 months. I wouldn't recommend him much earlier, he'd be too big to hang on to. I imagine later, when she's older, she'll think the coins are neat too. You can't see in the photo but on the other side of the coins they have as many dots as the currency, which seems to hold her gaze for a while. I would buy this again and won't be surprised if this pig ends up being her best friend."
45540,1,"I went to a friend's house who happened to have one of these and my baby seemed to like it pretty well. So, for Christmas she got one from my parents upon my suggestion. This is BY FAR her favorite thing. Initially she LOVED to lay on her back and kick at the animals as well as grab them between her feet. Now that she is more aware of her hands, she loves to grab at them and bat them around. I know as she spends more time on her tummy, she will also love the things to look at and play with there. What an absolutely GREAT product. She ""visits"" with the animals and doesn't seem to get bored with it as she can with other things."
101405,2,The package was supposed to have one 6 foot plastic chain and 10 clips. It had 3 chains and clips. Had to send it back but Amazon made that easy.
133654,1,"We have found this insert works in both round and oblong seats. The oblong seat seemed to make her little legs stretch further before reaching the edge on the standard toilet. It's an easy way to take a ""potty"" with you for a weekend and grandmas or whatever. Very easy to use and our daughter likes the ducks and glow in the dark bubbles. Might be better if had side handles, but she does fine without them."
76492,0,"I bought this to simulate the way the NICU had my preemie sleeping. They inclined the entire little &quot;container&quot; he was sleeping in and had blanket rolls on each side of him. He's now 6 weeks old and I'm HOPING he's 6 pounds--but the foam in the wedge has already lost it's shape where the baby sleeps. Like he's been sleeping on it for years or he was too big and wore out the foam (which he clearly is not). I also found that he worked his way down and occasionally had his face buried in one side or the other of the side positioners; but I alleviated this by swaddling him (legs only) and having the excess blanket underneath him. This serves 2 purposes because the netting at the head part IS a bit scratchy--so I need the extra blanket to go under his head or he won't sleep.The flip side is that the baby has always slept in his big, open crib with this and I don't worry about him swallowing his spitup. I also agree with the poster who was more at ease co-sleeping with the baby in this. I felt the same way when I napped with him.It certainly serves it's purpose; I'm just annoyed that I already need to buy another one in the near future and it's only been in use for a few weeks."
176455,2,My local WIC office gave me this pump when my First Year's pump seemed like it was on the fritz. Let's just say I went back to my old pump because it still worked better than this one even when it wasn't working right. This one is just a huge waste of time and money. The suction is poor and unnatural and I can't even get let down with it. I can barely get an ounce out of a side at a time. I've borrowed one of Medela's higher end pumps from a friend in the past and thought that this one would carry on with the company's high quality and standards that I'm used to but it definitely does not! Don't waste your time and money. Look around for another pump instead.
93980,0,"We live in Michigan and will want a similar product, but we had to return the Wrap and Ride. We couldn't make it fit the 3-point harness on our car seat without a lot of bunched fabric under the baby. Too bad, because other than that, we liked it. The product could be improved if they were to change the top vertical slits for the harness into a 't' shape so that it could take either kind of harness."
163494,1,The baby staff in general required so much space which is a problem for couples living in a small place.It's good to have all the funtions of one of this huge chairs in this modern and well designed space saver chair. I love it.
96419,2,We bought these locks for our front and back doors. We have Schlage lever handles (like you get at Lowe's or Home Depot) and these did not fit the handles at all. Make sure you see what kind of handle you have prior to buying these.
159490,1,"This product has been a life saver for me! When our daughter was first born I would place her in the bouncer and set it to vibrate, which she absolutely loved. I could also remove the toy bar so I could get her in and out easily (since she wasn't too interested in toys at that age.)At around 1 month she started to really enjoy the toy bar and the fun songs that it plays. When the music goes the spiders move up and down as well as several other things on the toy bar and she loves to just watch them move back and forth. The music is actually the perfect length for my shower and it keeps her entertained for the whole time. The music is not annoying (as a lot of the children's toy tunes can be) and it is actually quite catchy.Now at 3 months old she wants to reach out and play with the toy bar but the spiders are too far away for her to reach so we are back to removing the toy bar and just using the bouncer as a seat for her to play with other toys or so she can watch us as we cook, etc. I am sure that as soon as she has grown a little more and is able to reach the toy bar she will enjoy the chair even more again."
139144,1,"This is the coolest night light/ bed time lamp! Well worth the $$$$. We purchased this for our 1 year old, and by the time night fall came our 11 year old daughter took it. Not much of a hands on toy for the little ones, but it's defenitaly a great room deco. Going to buy another today for our oldest daughter!"
104580,0,"The pillow is ok. It's more convenient to stuff all over my bed with pillows. However, I wish they make a smaller size for petites and I'm not able to have a lot of back support with my small frame. Also, I agree with the reviews online that the pillow cover is not the easiest thing to put in, definitely not a ""snap on."" On the plus side, it's the perfect back support if you sit up to watch TV, read books etc."
61879,1,"I use Huggies Diapers until we go to ""pull-ups/easy ups"". I love Huggies Diapers, but do not like the velcro side on Huggies pull-ups. My son would take them off all the time just because they were so easy to take off by pulling apart the sides and they would leak all the time when he woke up in the morning.With Pampers Easy Ups I didn't have to worry about my son being able to take them off by pulling apart the sides and it was an extreme rarity for him to soak through then in the night."
101723,0,"We are expected our second child in a few months and like everyone else, I needed a system to monitor both kids. The third transmitter was an added bonus for the boys playroom. The system worked great for the first month, now both receivers make constant funny noises, not really like static but more like a clicking sound. It doesn't matter where the monitor is placed or if it is plugged in or on battery power. It is incredibly bothersome. The store I purchased it at won't take it back since I don't have the original box it came in so now I have to figure out what to do with this pricey item that bothers me!"
72434,1,We just purchased a 2011 Toyota Sienna and were interested in protecting the leather. This product does a great job and it is also a material that is non slip. Simple to install and delivers the protection needed with 3 car seats in there. I highly recommend it.
25757,0,"The handles are useless, you can't line up the spout. The bigger cup has the handles built into the lid, which is a much better idea. Still, without the handles (you can snap them off and on), it stores nicely, and 7 ounce size is plenty big enough. The soft spout let my son bite the milk out like he did on his bottle and is working well now that he's starting to suck better. Good transition from bottle for him. Ours might leak a drop or so when he puts it down, but I think that's waht he sucked out but is still in the recessed part, so amount leaked is very limited.If you want/need the handles, this cup is not for you. Still, the bigger cup with handles built in is harder to store, so this works well for me. He's used to tipping his bottle, so doesn't need handles anyway."
170151,1,Excellent product...As they wished my wife... It was easy to assemble... And my son is very happy...!!!I recommend... ;-)
89509,0,"These diapers smell kinda plastic!!! But besides that the diapers function very, very well and has an incredible price. This is great since I just had triplets. Economy pack highly recommended for those with many kids!!!!!!!!!!!"
175504,1,It took me a while to understand how to install them. but I installed these gates both up and down stairs they look good and work like a charm. I am very happy with the price and quality.
165663,1,Still gave this diaper 5-stars even though it does finish second to Pampers Swaddlers for newborns - especially smaller newborns. However what helped this earn 5 stars was the good pricing and the fact that these diapers do work well. I would recommend these.
143124,2,"This was bought as a gift and I hate it. I used it only a few times because the contents mix with the other slots, so you have no idea how much formula your putting into the bottle."
37490,2,"The cooler is well designed and good for size to still fit in the diaper bag. The handle strap isn't too long and it's easy to quickly grab without having yards of strap to hold or bunch together for storage. I'll be returning this product, becasue I'm not pleased with how the inside lining has not been sewn to each corner/edge seam of the cooler on the main compartment of the coooler. The top compartment lining is sewn to each seam/corner. The liner is just sloppy and bluky on the inside of the main compartment and the liner material is not great quality. I'm bummed the construction of the liner isn't more well made, I like the design, size and funcitons of this cooler for tall bottles and baby food jars/spoons, etc. I can fit 6 Dr. Brown's 8 oz. standard bottles in the cooler with 1 ice pack in the bottom, but it's almost too tight of a fit to get the top of the cooler zipped when the bottles are fully assembled w/caps on the bottles. The 6 Dr. Brown's standard 8 oz. bottles would fit better without being assembled and simply have the Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps on the bottles. If 6 Dr. Brown's standard 8 oz. bottles are packed w/out assembly and with only storage caps, there is little to no space left for Dr. Brown's bottle parts or additional ice packs in the main compartment of the cooler, unless fewer bottles were packed or the upper compartment of the cooler was used for the Dr. Brown's bottle parts. The Dr. Brown's 8 oz. standard bottle reserviors fit well in the top compartment of this cooler along with the other Dr. Brown's bottle parts needed for feeding."
161937,0,"I just recently received this tub from a friend as a gift for my two month old, and i absolutely enjoy it as much as my son does. His first time in it was a treasure that i will never forget because i took pictures. He had a wonderful look an his face as to say ' what took me so long to get this', he cooed, smiled and was very relaxed. I was very comfortable being able to have both hands free to wash him. A day never goes by without our safety 1st bath tub."
73961,1,"We travel a lot with our 2.5 and 1 year olds and always bring it along. It carries our kids safely and isn't much heavier than an umbrella stroller; perfect for air travel. We just visited Thailand on holiday, which is not the friendliest for strollers - lots of uneven pavement plus it rained the whole trip. The caboose and dry and snug rain fly kept the kids dry and the stroller held up to four days of rugged Thai roads. Really sincerely impressed."
88713,1,I had been using Huggies Overnites and this was a great deal (with an e-coupon) so I thought I'd give them a try. I like how thin they are while still being really absorbent. Great fit!
21025,0,"There was not enough feet in one roll. I also had the same problem, I was 3 and a half feet short to finish the room. So I had to go out and buy another 21.00 roll for 3 and a half feet!Also when I purchased the second roll and got it home, it was about 1/2 centimeter shorter in width then the first roll. So make sure they match up in width before buying the second roll.Otherwise this wall border is cute, and will last awhile, because it's not just for a baby!"
38293,1,"I bought this gate because it looked like it would be easy for my 3.5-year-old to open, but not for my 10-month-old. It works well in that respect--she can open this one but not the one at the bottom of the stairs, which has a pushbutton latch, and the baby can't get through either. However, I don't think ANY pressure-mount gate is safe at the top of the stairs. All of these gates rely on a thick piece of steel at the bottom, which is a real tripping hazard for a kid or an adult holding a baby. This type of gate is fine for the bottom of the stairs, but a fixed-mount gate is much safer at the top, unless you can somehow mount the gate so the top of the steel bar is flush with the top of the stairs."
63135,2,"These tubes are after market. They are not ""by Medela"" as they posted. Plus, who knows if they are BPA free and so on. They sorda scared me. I would never use after market parts like this on a machine that I use to get food for my baby with.I called Medela and told them that my tubes are looking funny and knew that there was a recall on some part of my pump. They then just told me that there will be some new ones sent to me, ""want is your address?"". Plus, there was no charge. If you don't have the same luck then you can buy them on their site you just have to dig around to find the online ordering. I would try customer service first."
26537,0,"This is only a partial evaluation which is why I am giving it 3 stars. After I actually use the product (4 months from now), i'll add more to my eval.I chose this rocker because I like the wood look and the color of the bassinet. But I also found that it's fairly easy to assemble. I'm 5 months pregnant and I was able to put this together myself. I only needed help from my husband when I had to put the wheels on. You kind of have to slam the wheels on so they lock in place, this useful info isn't listed in the instructions. I really like the wood/metal frame of the bassinet. I just don't have a lot of faith in the plastic bassinets that I was looking at. So far so good. Hopefully, when I start using the bassinet, I will still be just as pleased with it.Continuation:Now that my baby is 4 months old I can give this item a full evaluation. Unfortunately I still give it 3 stars. What I sate above still holds true. I like the look and it is easy to assemble Now here is what I don't like:1) The thin cushion it comes with. It's REALLY thin. I know a firm mattress is what is recommended for babies but the cushion is so thin my son may as well be sleeping on the hard board itself. I use the ""Inclined to sleep"" in the bassinet just to make my son a little more comfortable.2) I HATE the locking mechanism that prevents the bassinet from rocking. It's loud, which startles my sleeping baby and it doesn't really lock the bassinet in place. The bassinet still has a little give to it. How did I notice this? My baby was sleeping on the left side of the bassinet when I noticed it was tilted a little. I thought I didn't have the lock in place but I did!!! It freaked me out because I thought it could have been a suffocation hazard."
8216,1,I absolutely love this Moses basket (so much so that I've given it to all of my expectant friends as gifts). It's functional and cute without being ostentatious! A great & practical gift!
75329,1,"I used this pump for a few weeks, the suction is very strong, i had to stop useing it because my nipples became so sore. overall very good product."
84947,1,"We bought this as a back up for when we are washing our daughter's original Taggie, or if we just can't find it. It's not as soft after you wash it, but it holds up well in the wash. Our daughter can't go to bed without it."
46689,2,"This swing would be great if the motor worked. On the swing levels 1 and 2 it has issues, will stop working and slows down. We called customer service and they sent us a new motor. That one worked fine for awhile but now it is having the same problem. Guess I will make a second call to them...how frustrating. SO overall this swing works fine for awhile but will most likely have motor problems."
146224,1,"I highly reccomend this to every parent. My son loves it and has been playing it in since he was 3 months. At first he started to just bounce around and listen to the music, but then each day he discovered something new to play with. It also helps him build leg strength and coordination. Also for parents it's great because you set your baby in it and let him play while you grab something to eat or clean up around the house. Definitely a must have!!"
89499,1,"We tried these after going through a box of Huggies with at least one soakthrough leak a week. These are great in terms of fit and absorption. They absorb a lot of liquid with no leaking, and don't get soggy. I only wish that they were not scented, but that's a minor complaint given how happy I am with them otherwise."
6507,1,This is a great product because the extra tab makes for added stretch without allowing leakage... what a great idea.
19859,2,The materials used to make these attractive bowls stinks! It comes out of the dishwasher with white crust that won't come off. When I washed the first bowl I thought it was a fluke and even tried to scrape of the stuff (didn't work). Then I realized it happened with all three bowls. I've thrown them away because now they're ugly!
40201,0,"Has anyone else had problems with the changes in Pampers diapers the past few months? A few months ago, we purchased a few of the economy-sized packs, as we usually do, from our local BRU. The material was changed on the area that the tabs secure to! I was disappointed because the superior ""holding power"" was the reason we always chose Pampers over Huggies (which we get more and better coupons for). I contacted customer service through the web site, and was informed it was a glitch in their manufacturing process, which was corrected. They were kind enough to send some coupons for free diapers. HOWEVER, the next few packages we bought...same thing. I bought Huggies for about 6 weeks, and decided last week to try Pampers again. Surely, the ""duds"" were out of circulation by that time. Nope! Bought the box, and again...same problem. Is this problem only in the Northeastern Ohio area? Or, I wonder, did the customer service representative fib just to appease me when the diapers have been permanently changed?THREE MORE E-MAILS AND I GOT TWO RESPONSES FROM THE ""PAMPERS TEAM"". ONE STATING IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHICH STORES STILL HAVE THE DEFECTIVE PACKAGES (HMMM...MY UNDERSTANDING WAS MANUFACTURERS COULD TRACK THIS BY CERTAIN NUMBERS). PLUS, IS IT LIKELY THAT B'RU HAS THE SAME DIAPERS ON THE SHELF FROM 5 MONTHS AGO???? THE OTHER ""PAMPERS TEAM MEMBER"" REPLIED THAT THE TEAM WASN'T AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, SHE WOULD INFORM THEM, AND INSINUATED IT WAS, PERHAPS, DUE TO SOMETHING ON MY PART (HAND LOTION, ETC.). THE STRIP THAT THE TABS ADHERE TO IS NOT AS FUZZY, HOW CAN THAT BE CAUSED BY HAND LOTION/WRONG SIZE/ETC.?THEY ARE BOTH FOLLOWING UP BY MAIL, SINCE E-MAIL ""LIMITS"" WHAT THEY CAN DO. BUT, WHY DO I WANT MORE COUPONS FOR A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, IF THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TRYING AGAIN? POOR, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT P & G/PAMPERS. HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE ELSE...MAYBE YOU CAN AT LEAST GET COUPONS FOR DEFECTIVE DIAPERS!"
119400,1,"I ordered this when baby was 3 weeks old and breastfeeding was taking its toll on my body (your body changes rapidly after pregnancy, labor and delivery and it can be very painful to adjust- plus baby also grows rapidly, getting heavier to hold every day), especially my back and shoulders. I wanted to relieve the weight of baby on my arm to feel more comfortable, especially during the night feedings. This product does the job. My lactation consultant loved to see that I had it and she said she prefers the Breast Friend to the Boppy pillow. First of all, you 'buckle' it under your breasts and it stays in place. Second, the foam it's made of is sturdy and there are 2 bumps that work as a positioner to baby (baby loves it and she falls asleep easy on it after nursing). It has a pocket where I keep baby comb, pacifier, aspirator, breast shell and even iPod touch. It has foam all around you, making a nice thin pillow for your lower back. I wash the cover and air dry, it looks as good as new. When I bought it they only had the Sunburst pattern, and I like it - it is light green, very cute. It was around 40 bucks at the time and more expensive at Babies-R-us (47, I think). Worth every penny. She is more than 3 months old now (around 13 lbs) and we use it every day for almost every nursing session. Sometimes I keep it on when she naps and go around the house holding her with one arm and using my free hand to grab stuff (phone, mail, my plastic straw cup), she never wakes up with my jiggling around. I write this very review with Breast Friend on and baby napping while I type with my free hand. It first took me a couple of days to get completely comfortable with it but then it was all good. Highly recommend it."
124061,2,"I have nice smooth, clean walls and these do not stay on. Might try the mirrored closet doors, but then the walls are bare again. I would not recommend to buy these."
37001,0,"Bought this with the intention of my son using it until he didn't need booster seats any longer (he is currently a bit over 20#'s at 1 year old). Design looks good as a booster, but we'll never get there. Biggest problem we had was with tightening the 5 point harness. I had to pull VERY HARD repeatedly on the tightening strap to even get marginally close to a proper belt tension on my son. The belts cross over each other underneath the seat, interfering with smooth motion. They also wrap in a tight circle around the height adjustment bar behind the seat, further interfering with smooth motion. I'm a male, and my wife did not even have a chance tightening this seat's belts. I also believe the complaints about the belts twisting... ours was starting to do this after a single use. Maybe good as a booster, but not as 5 point. It was not engineered well for this purpose. We returned it immediately."
105649,2,"We bought the Diaper Champ with our 1st child and used it until we had another child. It was great while he was being breast fed and wasn't that stinky but as he got older and ate a more varied diet it just stopped containing the smell. We changed the bags and wiped it out every few days and used lots of Lysol and it still smelled. Also after a while the cylinder that pushes the diaper down started to slide too far and get stuck and then it became a huge pain the drop a diaper in. Half the time you would have to tip the whole pail over or open the top to get a new diaper in.With our second child we bought the NEAT by saftey first, she is now a year and we LOVE it. It even contained the smell of our older childs diapers before potty training."
181567,1,"This gate works great. It's high enough not to worry about my dog or cat getting over it, and for the price, it's an undeniably good deal."
107250,1,"This is a great diaper pail. My husband and I choose this one mainly because it uses regular garbage bags but we've been VERY happy with it for other reasons as well. It's extremely easy to operate with one hand and it does an amazing job containing the smell. Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it. The appearance of the latch is deceiving - it makes you think you open it one way when it's really another. Once I learned the correct way to open it, it's very easy."
56858,1,This highchair is perfect!It assembled within 5 minutes.The wood is high quality.The design is stable... andIt complements a HOME atmosphere because it does not stick out like a sore thumb.Baby is happy!Thank you Eddie Bauer!!
183359,1,"Let's just say that I wish that I had bought this for my first daughter instead of using the crappy bassinet that came with our pack n play. I would have probably slept a whole let easier and so would she. This bassinet is comfy, the vibration is a life saver and it fit perfectly beside my bed. I would tell all new mommies that they've got to get one of these!"
32102,2,I placed an order for two Sunshine car organizers and was shipped Diono Stow n Go organizers.The Diono is now selling for $7.99 a piece and was not a good product.It never mentioned anything about a refund in the difference from a $14.99 product to a $7.99 product.I called and returned the Diono's and was told to try again to get the Sunshine Kid organizers.Ordered again and again was sent the Diono product.I have the Sunshine Kids organizer and wanted another one.Clearly Dainty Baby which is were I was told it was coming from has a problem.
176042,1,"Sounds logical, and the price is great.This is a best option for christmas and birthday gifts."
19045,1,"I am tremendously grateful with this sling, it's easy to use, it is not expensive, it is comfortable and my baby love it. Really the best by far."
153868,0,"The worst part is they are dry and I have tried both the dispenser box and the refill and both weren't that impressive. I like the natural touch, but would suggest Earth's Best over these."
8104,1,"I bought this stroller a month ago and I love it. Its been easy to use, not too hard to fold and not too heavy considering its a double. The wheels are large enough to ensure a smooth ride for the three month old. I'm as happy with it as I am with my Peg Pergo single stroller."
48139,2,"Looking at the picture for this product, I thought I was getting something that would prevent my baby from falling from both sides - you only get one of them."
116189,1,I ordered these for the first time when my son was about 10 months old and I couldn't believe how much easier it makes dining out with a little one. I was always worried about the germs from the table and I couldn't put a plate in front of him because he would dump the food and throw the plate! I also tried putting food on a napkin but that was even worse! I now use these with my second child and I wouldn't think of eating out without them. They are large enough to cover the perfect amount of table and I can relax knowing that she's not eating food directly off of the table. I apply the bottom sticky strip just under the edge of table and then pull tight to apply the top one. This is a must have!
105580,1,"I initially requested the diaper genie for my baby shower. I had a ton of people recommend the diaper champ over the genie, but I figured it had a bigger name at the time.... WHAT A MISTAKE!!!This diaper holder is PERFECT!!! It uses ANY bags around, doesn't let any smell leak out and is so easy it can be operated with one hand. I am so glad that I bought it!!! I will use the same one for future children. It has taken a beating and is still working strong!!!"
59163,2,I've burned 2 bottles so far - for this price they should put in an auto shut off - don't buy it. Get one w/ the shut off option.
158048,1,"Yes, I'll admit upfront that the buzzing is annoying (and if you set the volume too low, it doesn't register any sounds in the parent unit at all). But I can deal with that because of the other benefits (although I hope the manufacturer will improve that aspect). I had a sound-only monitor (great quality) w/my 1st child, but he slept on his side so I didn't worry as much, plus I didn't even know this thing existed. My 2nd child has acid reflux and as a result, immensely prefers sleeping on her tummy. In fact, we spent a month waking up EVRY SINGLE HOUR - no lie. When I found out about this, I bought it immediately. This is such a life saver, I would have paid $200 for it. The alarm went off twice in 5 months (of course, I've forgotten to turn it off, and it beeped!). Once she was too far in the corner, and the other time, she really wasn't breathing. The alarm went off, and when I checked on her, her chest wasn't moving at all. I jostled her a little, got her breathing, and went back to bed. It went off again right away. She wasn't breathing again. I pulled her out of bed that time and she woke up. When I put her back down, she was fine. I know babies have irregular breathing patterns, but I'll never know if she would have started breathing again on her own. Why chance it? It doesn't matter if your baby sleeps on his/her back, side or tummy - I don't know why a parent who knows about this monitor wouldn't buy it. It is truly the best purchase I ever made. I would be a company spokesperson, I feel that strongly."
162891,1,"it is a good product , but its fabric is a little too smooth"
66450,1,"I am a huge fan of the HALO SleepSacks. We bought the medium size for my daughter, who is now 9 months old, and about 17 lbs. and 28"". It is a great fit with plenty of room to grow lengthwise still. She is able to flip over at night and can still stand up in her crib wearing this. We put this over a sleep-and-play and set the thermostat to 70-72, and it keeps her warm at night but not so warm that she's sweating or overheating.The fleece is soft and still looks great after repeated washings. In fact, we have another that has been handed down from her big cousins, and it is just starting to look a little worn now that it's going through the third child. So I would say the quality is definitely worth the price you pay.However...speaking of repeated washings... When she was in the newborn and small sizes, I bought these at Babies R Us and they were fine. For some reason, the one I bought through Amazon had a horrible smell. I don't know if it's the plastic/rubbery smell from the HALO package or what, but it was awful. I washed and dried it FOUR times before I even thought about putting it on my daughter, and the first time I tried I ended up taking it right back off and washing it again. It has now been washed probably about 8 times or so, and it still has a faint odor that I can smell when I snuggle her at night. I'm not sure if this is an Amazon problem or just a strange fluke with the HALO packaging, but I've never had this problem with the other HALO SleepSacks I've bought. That's the only reason I'm taking my rating down one star.Other than that, I would highly recommend the HALO SleepSacks. They are good quality and great for keeping your little one warm, but not too warm!, at night without having to worry about blankets getting kicked off or tangled up or over their face."
61234,0,"Once you get the hang of how everything works on this contraption, it does a good job of controlling the odors. I find though that sometimes you have to twist the ring several extra times to get it tight enough to hold the diapers, and you are using up more of your refill that way. Also, sometimes it just comes undone and you have to re-cut the bag and start all over again. I think it is just as easy to tie up the offending diaper into a plastic grocery sack and toss into the trash. I have purchased scented diaper sacks... for diaper disposal during travel, and I sometimes use those at home instead of having to mess with the diaper Genie. I guess if it weren't so unpredictable I would have given it a better rating since the main thing for me is avoiding the dirty diaper smell. It does take care of that problem. Oh, emptying the thing is kind of cumbersome too."
118617,1,I used one of these mills for my own children many years ago and was thrilled to learn they still made them. It works well.
36201,1,"This product is so much easier to use than the ""typical"" baby carrier. I love this product and it helps my little one to fall asleep as I walk the church halls with him. I highly recommend it."
118072,1,"This gets the bottle very nice and warm without being too hot for my baby. It works well each and every time if you know what to expect. Here's what to expect- 1. It will take 30min so plan ahead. 2. It will keep it warm for up to 3 hours in the sleeve so you have some leeway on when to click it hot (click the button early!) 3. If you drop it or it is in a bag getting bounced around, it might click on accidentally. It's not the end of the world because it will keep the bottle warm until the baby is hungry. 4. You have to boil it in hot water for 15 min each time after you use it to reset it.I have the Prince Lionheart and this one. The advantage of the Price Lionheart is that there is a handle with velcro that keeps the handle together so you can hang it on the stroller or hold it easily. The Dex cover is more malleable and I prefer this one but my nanny prefers the Prince Lionheart cover. The heating mechanism is a different shape too. The Prince Lionheart has a circular part that goes under the bottle but yet it is not as long as the Dex. All in all, the heating mechanism on this and the Prince Lionheart one works about the same."
90177,2,This is the worst nighttime diaper we have used. They leak 100% of the time leaving our baby drenched in her own urine! Awful. :( I highly recommend Huggies Overnites-zero problem with leaks and a great fit.We will not attempt to use these again.
139849,1,"After considering my choices between other walkers and stationary saucers, I bought this walker. Our son has been using it for about a month and he loves it! He's only 4 1/2 months (but very big and strong for his age), and he speeds across the kitchen floor... watch our for your toes and the cat lying on the floor! The wide base of the walker makes it impossible to be tipped. The arm on the back makes it easy to move the walker from room to room when the baby is not in it. Right now we put toys on the see-through tray for our son to play with. In another month or so we'll add the activity tray and our son will think he has a whole new toy. The only drawback we've found it that our son can't move it on the carpet (not sure if that's typical of all walkers or if our son just isn't strong enough yet). The option of making the walker stationary is a nice feature as it can be used for a feeding chair; however, our son knows that the walker can move and gets upset when he can't move it, so the stationary feature probably won't get any use by us. If you're looking for a sturdy, entertaining walker, this one is well worth the money."
21052,1,"I love my Inglesina Twin Swift, which nails just about everything on my wish-list for a double stroller. As wide as a standard wheelchair, it fits through pretty much all doors, is still wide enough to be comfortable to the kiddos, can turn on a dime (e.g., enter an elevator, and just swivel in place to face the other direction), isn't affected by a heavy child in one seat and a super-light one in the other, folds up about as small as my SINGLE Urban Jogger stroller (not as small as an umbrella single, but very small for a double), is easy to fold, can be steered one-handed, has 6 pairs of wheels so it rides quite smoothly (not as smoothly as a jogging stroller with 1-foot wheels, but surprisingly well), has ergonomically positioned handles, I don't kick the wheels with my feet as I'm walking, and the two seats can recline independently.When I was researching these online I found conflicting information (sometimes on the same web page) as to whether it holds 35 or 45 pounds per seat. The answer in the product manual is 15 kilos (about 35 pounds). Unfortunately, my older daughter is already 30 pounds so I'm hoping I can push the limit a little.Some online reviews complain about the hood/canopy coming off upon folding the stroller. I haven't noticed this, although I LOVE that it unclips so easily... sometimes we clip it where it belongs, sometimes extra high, sometimes extra low, and sometimes I detach the clip and my daughter pulls the cover down to her knees for an insulated-bubble effect while walking (which is great if you get stuck in the rain!)."
22074,0,"So, I sampled these bags in a gift pack and my initial reaction was awful! But then I started pumping at work and I really need to make my time the most efficient. So, I went ahead and bought some more. Here is how I have optimized:1. Inaccurate measurement - Because the bag changes shape and just because it is slightly inaccurate, the measurement on the side cannot be trusted. It says there is more in the bag then there actually is. I hold the top open so that the bag has a uniform shape to get the measurement as close as possible and then go down to the nearest 1/2 oz. So if its somewhere between 2.5 and 3 oz., then I would write 2.5 oz. So I know there is at least that much in the bag.2. Milk splashes above the zip lock - Try to push the yellow part down into the bag below the zip lock.3. The bag walls stick together so milk doesn't go to the bottom of the bag - I open the top and spread out the bottom of the bag so there is a uniform open space. Then I use the breastfeeding bra (I use halter type but one with zip seems to be more efficient) so that my hands are free to fix the bag if necessary. I could imagine that the bottom of this bag would have wire that could be adjusted to hold bag open (kinda like the twisty wire used for bread)4. It never occurred to me to complain about the ziploc until I read other complaints, but it would be worth double or triple checking the ziploc by rubbing your fingers over it a couple of times and then again when u take the bag from fridge or freezer. Not guaranteed to prevent all leaks but seems like it could help.Although given all that needs to be done once i get through my 50 bags, I may just try using other bags with my pump with masking tape and see how that works."
41515,1,"I can't find this size and quantity locally, so it is the biggest bang for my buck and on a quality diaper. I have used huggies and luvs and feel that both are inadequate to Pamer Cruisers. I have less blow outs and less laundry, which in turn saves me time and money. Gott'a love that."
54033,1,I just bought this and own a Tahoe. Well there is no middle headrest but there is a thing in the middle that comes out for drinks. I use this to put the strap around and it stays on perfect. I didn't have to use the velcrow(sp) or anything. But I did make the mistake of trying to clean the mirror with Windex. Don't do this is will smear the whole mirror.Nicholle
109178,1,If you have a Bumbo and love it then you definitely have to get the tray! its great for learning to self feed and especially if you have two kids and not two high chairs... you can put your little one in the Bumbo and toddler in the high chair and they both can eat independently!! Its great to have your hands free to do other stuff being a SAHM.
115644,1,"This bag has everything! I always had the problem of the bags falling off my shoulder...this one has yet to fall off. I love having everything right at hand, instead of digging for it. I can put small things(medicines) in the front pockets; bottle in the bottle pocket; a diaper and wipes in the back(net) pocket and a bib and spare socks right inside the big part. And I always have a spare set of clothes nice, clean and not wrinkled in the bottom pocket. AND my cell phone right at hand, where I can hear it AND get to it very easily while carring the diaperbag AND the baby!!This is the BEST diaper bag (and last) you will ever buy!!"
12023,2,"These types of items that you buy separate from the car seat and add to it are called ""aftermarket products"" and are not recommended. Certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians state that these products have not been crash tested and may interfer with the way your car seat was designed to function. Anything that comes with a car seat has been crash tested with the seat. Anything you buy to add to the seat has not. Nothing should go behind the baby or around the harness straps of the car seat. A better alternative to protect floppy newborn heads is to take a thin receiving blanket, roll it up and bend it into an upside-down ""U"" shape and place it around the baby's head.

59926,1,I just tried out this tub with my 4 month old and it is awesome! Finally a tub that we can use and enjoy! Before this one we used the smaller infant tub that folds up and it worked great but she has grown out of it. Then we tried the 4 stage tub and it was a pain for us to use. It was hard to hold her up in the sling (she still isn't sitting up)and we had to use it in the bathtub because it leaked. We love this one because you don't have to use it in the tub (hurt my knees!!) and it holds her up so well that I can actually enjoy giving her a bath with 2 hands. And she has room for her feet to be in the water (to splash and keep warm)and for toys! Don't waste money on any other tub. I wish we had gotten this sooner!
91248,2,I've been through three monitors and this is the worst. The quality is definitely reflected in the price. I would only suggest it if you need a back up monitor to leave at a relative's occasional babysitter's home. The static is unbearable. It's worth springing for an expensive monitor.
74442,1,"These make sitting down at the table with our 2yr old little girl a lot easier. She loves the characters and although I can't say it encourages her to eat more, but, her table manners have gotten a lot better."
3176,1,We love this product. We started with the size small in fleece and now own 2 size large. I agree that the baby can get his arms out but even now that my son is 4 months old we use it and just don't wrap his arms inside of it. I like the feeling that the blanket doesn't get anywhere near his face.
106290,1,"As new parents, we have found it truly amazing how much money goes for all the little extras--batteries, film, pacifiers, wet wipes, etc. This is one reason I passed up the diaper genie, which although is a great product from what I've heard, requires the frequent purchase of refills which can be complicated to install. So we decided to go for the Diaper Champ, which just requires normal trash bags which you're going to buy any way. On the whole, it's worked well. To diminish the likelihood of bad odors in the nursery, one should change the bag frequently, before it gets full. The one problem is the mechanism it uses to &quot;roll&quot; the diaper into the champer often gets stuck if you use diapers with sticky tabs--velcro diaper tabs, no problem. Overall I like this product and I like not having yet one more expense like refills."
113992,2,"I don't have a whole lot to say about this booster, but wanted to note to other buyers that there is a potential tipping hazard with the seat.We visited with friends for lunch one day and they pulled out this booster and attached it to a folding chair and brought it to the dining room table for us to use. I sat next to my 10 month old daughter the whole time but simply did not react fast enough when she leaned forward and tipped the entire apparatus (the high chair and the adult folding chair) forward. Since the chair was facing the dining table, she ended up busting her lip right on the edge of the glass table. The booster with tray can be quite front heavy, so please be sure you only attach it to a very sturdy and preferably wide chair. And insist on it if you're visiting others (we are often too polite for our own good). My daughter is not a very active or bouncy baby, but she managed to tip it over while leaning forward. There aren't warnings to this effect on the booster seat, but I wanted to make the issue known to other parents to whom it may not have occurred."
24424,1,"Purchased gate to keep doggie out of the living room and for future visits from grandchildren. Very convenient, easy to use. Easy to adjust to size of door. Very satisfied."
100290,1,"It comes in the box you see, the daipers are wrapped up tight in 3 big sets, it arrived in good time and has been a huge help with my newborn."
115456,1,"I began using the Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Castile liquid soap in 1999 when I moved to Michigan, and I got to tell you, this is the BEST soap you can use after a 95 degree day with 80-90% humidity in Michigan, and now the Arizona summers I'm stuck with in Phoenx. Few things short of sitting in ice water will cool you off faster....for the people complaining about the ""lather"" this is 100% natural soap, so it does not have the chemicals that other soaps have for sudsing. It requires the use of a bath poof or sponge. I have sensitive skin, and deal with hard water in Arizona, and this is also extremely well performing in terms of my skin and getting clean."
27936,1,"I love this little seat. We used it to start feeding out 5 month old solids until she was big enough for the big highchair. Now we use it for her to sit with us on the couch. Of course you must watch them at all times while they are in the chair as she is 9 months now and can tip it over on the couch pretty easily. But it helps her stay in one place so we don't have to make sure she's not crawling right off the couch cusions. We did get more use out of it when she was younger, but she has a baby brother on the way that will get more use out of it. I do wish I would have gotten the one with the tray though so she could have had easier access to her toys before she could sit up by herself. We also used this as a seat on the floor for her to situp and play with toys before she could do it on her own. All in all I am very glad we got this!"
80780,0,"I really liked the price on these, BUT they have leaked ten times more than the actual pullups. I have since switched back to them despite the increase in price."
44037,0,Never really used. We have hard water and it had to many small spots to get yucky. Threw out pretty quick. Was kind of hard to so it would rally help if they got to close.
43026,1,"I am not sure how we would have dealt with our son's colic without the Moby wrap. I wore it for hours on end every day in the house while I soothed him. It was the only thing that consistently worked to calm him down. It was great to have him close to me but also to have my hands free. It was very comfortable. It is a bit of a pain to get on, but well worth it. I agree with other reviews that it is difficult to use outside of the house, we have an Ergo baby for that. Overall, very happy with this product!"
162610,2,"We bought this tub before our son was born thinking it looked safe &amp; easy to use. I put him in it once &amp; it was obvious that it was uncomfortable &amp; he had too much room to wriggle about. It just made him scream, and after more thought I realized you'd have to fill it with towels to make it feel cozy &amp; cushy to an infant whose already being overloaded with new experiences. It was much easier, and more fun, to just put him in a regular bath with me on my lap where I could hold him &amp; he could feel the warmth &amp; security of my skin. Save yourself the money!"
95390,1,I was satisfied with this order. My daughter had a heap of stuffed animals and they all fit in the hammock.
25518,1,"I did a lot of research before trying these liners the first time. I find them to be invaluable, as other have said, after baby begins solids.What sold me on these liners over others is that when there is no solid waste in the baby's diaper, you can add these to your diaper wash and reuse them at least once, though I get at least two washes from each pee-only diaper change.These are also really large, in spite of being the baby size and not the toddler size. I know that some people have recommended cutting each liner in half to get even more out of each roll, but I don't have that kind of patience. :)"
18435,1,"DR. BROWN'S BOTTLES-Pros:1. No more suction ""pulling"" and noises, as with other bottles such as Avent which can be annoying and frustrating for both baby and mommy. These bottles are suction-free.2. Less gassy baby, though gas still not completely eliminated.3. Nipple is much softer than on other bottles, more like actual breast feeding, and more comfortable for the baby to suck on.4. Less frequent spitting up, but again, spitting up will still occur with these bottles.Cons:1. Hassle to clean and time consuming.2. More expensive than other bottles.3. Leak!!!! These bottles cannot be shaken, and cannot be warmed up with the nipples attached, or they will boil over and leak like mad. Make sure you remove the nipple and ring before you heat the bottle! Attach it after!!!!4. The cap is annoying to snap on and off (wide bottles only). The plastic is a little too hard and tight.5. If you're on-the-go, it is hard to fill the bottle and handle all of the parts if you don't have a clean surface to put the parts down on.6. Take longer to heat than other bottles. I don't know why but it must have something to do with the plastic, which seems thicker than on other bottles.I GIVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE IT ISN'T PERFECT. BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S THE BEST OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY OUT IN THE MARKET.NOTE: If your baby is spitting up because of acid reflux or some other gastro problem, these bottles are NOT your sole answer. You should use them in conjunction with either medication (such as Zantac) and/or with a predigested formula such as Nutramigen. Consult your doctor."
157446,0,"This product arrived promptly, but after over an hour of putting it together, we realized one of the parts was not manufactured correctly (holes were not in the correct spots), so couldn't finish putting it together until we received replacement parts from the manufacturer. There were also some issues with two other parts (scratches and dents). I requested replacement parts directly from the manufacturer's website, and they were quickly shipped to us. The replacement parts worked, but one of them was still not manufactured properly (front bottom molding was not painted on one end, but I decided to paint myself just to get the project completed). Overall, now that the item is assembled and in the nursery, it looks nice, but I would give quality (or at least quality control at the manufacturer) a marginal score. Last thing to note is the weight of the item. This piece is surprisingly VERY heavy, so take that into consideration if you don't have help to get it moved to where you need it."
68399,0,"It says it has to be washed in cold on the gentle cycle. This is impractical for baby's and I wish I'd known this before I bought it. THe color is nice, and it seems study so far."

99573,1,"We've use a couple of brands of diapers, and Pampers are the best quality for this price. I love the elastic-ness around the waist- better than Huggies I think. And with Amazon Mom, subscribing and using coupons from Parenting magazine, I get these for 50% off!"
124950,0,"I know lots of people whose kids have enjoyed this, but my daughter didn't. I only used it a handful of times. The first time I put her in it, she jumped and jumped, obviously enjoying herself, but after that first time, she never wanted to be in it again."

5511,2,"My daughter loves these cups but one leaks - and really, that's the purpose of a sippy cup not to leak. It may just be a defective valve but I won't buy this brand again."
103694,0,"I bought this pack assuming that the wipes would be in one large package - should have read the product description because these are individually wrapped wipes. Might be good for some users, but I find that the price isn't worth getting them individually wrapped compared to carrying around a pack of wipes- not a great value if you are trying to buy in bulk."
68733,1,before this i tried huggies and i found leaking always. now i turned to pampers cruisers its been 2 months no leaking and now iam changing diapers for every 4 hours and nights like every 5 hrs but didn't find any leaking awsome product....
127899,2,Perhaps they should advertise this as the wide mouth bottle brush because everything I read in the reviews is absolutely true. Water gets sprayed everywhere and it is gross. Thank goodness these were given to me and I didn't waste my own money!
36288,0,"I really like the pattern and colors of this bedding. However, the bumper pad does not fit all the way around our crib. Also, the sheet shrank up so much that I couldn't get it back on the bed.Crib bedding is nice, but a waste of money. The only piece of bedding that we are still using is the curtain. The comforter is hanging over the chair since you are not suppose to use covers for infants. The crib sheet ripped. The bumper pad did not fit. The ruffle is off the crib now since the crib is lowered all the way."
112128,1,"Well, these jumbo diapers sure can hold a jumbo amount of poop. Today's kids are bigger than ever, with Mc Donald's hamburgers feeding them they're sure to need these jumbo size poop holsters. They're flexible too, so crrrrawling isn't a problem. Thumbs up from me!"
114335,1,"This product gets more use than most of our baby purchases.You can start using it as soon as they are sitting up.We used it as a high chair at the regular dining room table. We carried it to another room to feed her snacks on the floor while doing laundry or office work. We brought it to restaurants instead of using high chairs (to keep her slightly away from the table because this child will grab for any knife, plate glass or salt shaker she can reach... it's cleaner than restaurant high chairs, too.) We brought it to friends' houses to eat dinner.Now that she is almost 2, we use it as a booster every day.Throw the tray in the dishwasher. This product is perfect."
14632,1,"As a first time mom, I was confused about what bottle to use for my baby. After a lot of research, I decided to use Playtex's Vent-Aire bottles and they worked out great...no colic and minimal gas...they were great....UNTIL my baby started drinking 6+ ounces of formula in one feeding. The 6oz bottles -AND- the 9oz bottles both didn't have enough room for proper mixing of powder formula. The formula would get stuck at the nipple and it was very inconvenient to shake and try to get it to mix well.Despite all of the negative reviews on this website and the unsolicited advice of a well-intentioned stranger at Target who also warned me about the leaks she experienced with these bottles, I went ahead and decided to try them out myself!I'm sure glad I was not swayed from my decision to give these great bottles a try! They are so easy to clean (compared to the Vent-Aire bottles) and mixing powder formula is not a problem at all! My baby can hold the bottle with no problem. Quite the change from the Vent-Aire bottles.It is worth mentioning that I did have an incident where the Avent bottle leaked, but that was because I was not following the directions properly. If moisture gets trapped at the lip of the base of the nipple, it obviously won't seal right."
109400,1,"My 7 month old baby loves this product, and it keeps her busy for a long time. Bonus for me! It's such a quick way to give her a healthy snack. I do find it tricky to get all the food particles out of the crevices, but maybe I just have a crappy dishwasher."
33455,1,"This gate is very handy and does everything it needs to. I don't have kids, but I do have a lab, and it keeps her in the house"
134411,2,I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing. Well it wasnt. I should have read more into it. It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder. I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it.
7545,1,"I cannot say enough good things about this product. When I had my daughter I received a big old hand-me-down Graco stroller from a relative, but hated trying to get it all situated when I just needed to run in the store for something. It was the old kind that the carrier didn't snap into, but I didn't want to get one of those big bulky systems, either. Then a friend told me about the Snap 'N Go, and I can't tell you how happy I am!!!It was so easy to assemble, easy to figure out how to adjust the bars, and SUPER lightweight... very comparable to an umbrella stoller in weight. I would just lift the carrier out of the car and right into this, it's so easy! It also rides VERY well, and the basket in the bottom is so large, I can even go to the grocery store for small trips.The best thing is that it saves you so much money over buying one of the (bulky) travel systems. Once my daughter outgrew (at about 6 months old), I just bought a cheap-o stroller without all the bells and whistles, which did the job for another six months until she was big enough for an umbrella stroller.This is now the gift I give at every baby shower I attend... whether the mother has registered for it or not! I now use it for my son."
53019,0,"As a new mom, I did not appreciate the difference between this product and a bouncer. I just knew you were supposed to have something small and light to put the baby in that could be moved around your home. Now that my baby is older and I have hung out with other moms, I realize that what I really wanted was a bouncer and the papasan is somewhat limited. Upside: its good for naps--for awhile, our baby did not like his crib but he would sleep in this for short periods of time. Downside: there is no activity bar/toy bar so its kind of boring for him. Also, the round shape makes it take up a lot of room. We kept it but if I could do it all over again, I probably would not get this. I would get a bouncer with a removable toy bar (except there seem to be no good bouncers out there, but that's another review)."
154748,1,"These are non irritating, strong, unscented, pure ingredient wipes. They are great for babies, kids or adults as a no soap, no water quick face or hand wash, especially in the summer. Of course they are excellent for adult ""bottoms"" as well as baby ""bottoms"". Worth the extra cost over others because of the unscented, chlorine free, ingredient purity."
4268,1,This is a thin stretchy soft mattress pad that really is waterproof. I've had no leak-through even with toddler accidents. It does not crackle and isn't hot. I really like it and wish it came in larger sizes.
137419,2,"I bought this on the recommendation of my massage therapist; I am not nor was not pregnant, but I'm an overweight side sleeper with lower back issues due to past injuries (I got hit by a car), and was looking for something to assist me ergonomically so that I would be able to sleep in a back-healthy position. By the positive reviews here and her suggestion, I really thought this was going to solve my sleep issues and it has done only a little to help -- I've gotten more out of two ordinary long body pillows I bought for $10 each at Target.One major problem, and reason why I rate the item so low (and would be tempted to go lower), is that it is made of extremely cheap and entirely synthetic material that wears out quickly. The material also does not breathe and can get very hot very quickly (I can't imagine the pregnant woman it was designed for being very comfortable with it given some expecting women get hot easily). The pillow case *is* uncomfortable and scratchy; the first thing I did after trying it out was removing it and throwing it away, and I instead wrapped some 100% cotton sheets around it. It also flattens extremely quickly--the foam padding is not resilient at all, meaning it quickly loses its ability to support the areas of your body that need it most. And it is now even starting to break apart and tear in places (primarily for when I use it, where I rest my head or where I wrap it around my body when sitting up). I have owned the pillow for about 9 months -- interestingly enough, the length of a pregnancy, meaning if you DID buy it for support while pregnant, it would grow increasingly useless as your pregnancy progressed, and lose most of its value by the end.Now, obviously since I wore it out, I did use it, so it gets some props. I found it particularly useful for sleeping or napping on the couch (something I do sometimes because my A/C unit's in my living room), more because its shape and size helps fill in what makes sleeping on a couch usually uncomfortable. It is good for wrapping around yourself--as long as you don't mind getting hot--to sit up and get some good support while reading in bed or whatever. I use part of it sometimes to prop up my head/upper body (I have acid reflux, and propping up partly upright can help with that), but more because it's a convenient soft pillow that I happen to own, not because the design of this particular pillow is useful for it.What I don't get much out of it is actually helping me sleep on my side. Based on the (obscure and poorly explained) diagrams it provides, you have to really curl yourself up around it to get your knees and ankles supported, in a way that ultimately created more stress on my back than less. I also could not figure out how or where to put the arm/shoulder the side I was sleeping on that I was not putting too much pressure on it (I woke up several times with my hand or arm asleep because of this). It contains absolutely zero written instructions, just a few diagrams which only show one angle and leaves it otherwise to you to figure out how to make it work for you. Leachco's Website is useless in providing any further assistance.Now, I accept maybe the pillow wasn't right for my body type or needs or shape or something. But unfortunately, since it's a product I've only been able to find online, I had no way of knowing that till I bought it and tested it--and once you sleep with it, it can't really be returned. There's not much here or at Leachco's Website to help figure out what might have worked better if anything (notwithstanding the awful quality of the material it's made of).While the pillow does have some good qualities, it is largely a cheaply made and frustratingly designed pillow. Whatever benefits it does have, I found it was not absolutely, positively not worth the $58 I paid for it--again I got more out of a couple $10 body pillows I bought later. If I'd paid the full $75 MSRP for it I'd be all the more ticked off. If I buy a pillow valued at $75, it better be designed to last well more than a single year, and be made of high quality materials with a cotton pillowcase. As it is wearing out quickly, I doubt I will be able to use it much longer, and I will definitely not replace it with another LeachCo product. It is obviously they do not price their merchandise to reflect the quality of their products, but to rather to gouge pregnant or injured individuals desperate to get a good night's sleep. In my opinion, based on my personal experience, you're much better off finding much cheaper alternatives. Now of course, for those this pillow somehow worked for them, I'm glad they had a good experience, but I am extremely disappointed that mine was nowhere near the same."

26786,2,"I have 2 daughters, one is 23 months, the other is 12 months. About 8 months ago I bought this stroller from Babies R US. thought that is the best choice because of the brand name. Although there are many negative review on other website, I was so sure that this gonna be a useful stuff. Besides, I didn't find many negative reviews here on Epinions then.However, this stroller is a big disappointment. With normal use, the cup holder broken in 4 months, clip hold the seat controllers recline felt in 2 monthes, front stickers had detached in 1 months. The sun shade, has displaced in 5 months. The wheel is hard to steel and also hard to open since the beginning. What I said a normal use, included mall shopping, play ground/ park strolling. Normally I use it once a week and other shopping if they have a shopping cart, I would rather use shopping cart.12/22/06 one of my babies had felt out from the stroller to ground in front of Senta, while I am doing Christmas shopping in Woodbridge Center Mall. I was using a normal speed but a kind sharp turn in JCpenny. I was looking for bathroom. Both of babies' seat belts were detached on the back of the seat, and the felt baby, Hannah, her belt were still connect to the seat in the bottom but one buckle of the T buckles has unbuckled. The other baby, except back of the belt detached from seat, she was alright. Both of the babies' tray were took off because they were not like it.After that, I called the customer service about the seat belt easy to detach from back of seat. Their answer is the eye opener - well - the seat belt clip is not suppose to hold baby in the back. The hook purpose is to put the belt when baby is not in the seat. I ask them that is not count as 5 point harness if baby's seat belt cannot attached in the back of the seat of the stroller, they claim that the seat belt actually on the shoulder and they cannot fell out and count as 5 point harness. They also said that if I want to restrain the babies on the seat, I should choose other stroller.I called 4 times to make sure that is their answer(because it sounds to me like a joke),both my husband and I talked to them, and we all assume that the small hook on the seat belt that attached to the back of the seat should be part of the safety belt safety device; not mention the Customer service is cold and rude while they answer. I have nothing can say since her felt actually is not because the seat belt fail. Still, every time when the children are in seat, they are always loose, many times she had half felt out. If not have no other choice, one really don't know if it is proper to continue using this stroller."
156043,0,I go this but it was kind of big. My baby girl is 5months and she overlooks it. She tosses it and moves on to other toys. I will try once she get older. I hope it will get a better review!
4955,1,"I love these. My wife is really determined to use cloth diapers and while I hardily endorse her efforts I want no part of them. These are easy and because they are chlorine free, and don't have any stupid prints on them my wife is Ok with my using them. Awesome."
141996,2,Great in theory but the product itself is garbage. The adhesive lasted maybe a week then peeled off on half of it.
65961,1,"Tried it all. I used everything Platex has to offer with my first child and went on trying everything after that. Now with my second child - his problems include GER (reflux) and allergies/intolerances. We have tried Avent since birth because everyone said, &quot;they are the best&quot;. Phooie. I wish I had tried something else sooner. Dr. Brown's bottles are easier to drink from for my son. His problems are too severe for the bottle to be the end all cure - but he likes the softer nipple, doensn't have problems with milk leaking out of his mouth while drinking (I ALWAYS had to put a rag under his chin), less burping afterward, reduced spitting and generally more relaxed - before it was a bigger effort to drink from the Avent bottles (we tried all they had to offer.) Downside = the cleaning does take longer. Worth it though. (We use the wide mouth bottles for formula and regular neck for water/juice - occasionally)"
140476,1,"Even though the swing takes up a bit of space, the Fisher-Price Rainforest Cradle Swing is well worth the space. The fact that it can operate with or without batteries due to the plug-in feature is the main reason I purchased it. These options make it possible to use the swing anywhere. It also has a nice variety of options such as the ability to swing side to side or front to back along with several positions, sounds and speeds. Once the basics are acquired such as a crib and car seat, be sure to purchase this swing or one like it for yourself or as a gift. Nothing has helped our family's colicky babies like time in a swing."
104241,1,We got this because our cat had fallen from between the rails of our bannister and were afraid he might get hurt. Thankfully nothing happened to him except for him becoming frightened. I think this is a great idea but was hesitant about being able to properly install it.( Spacing the holes correctly and then putting all the ties in place). I did not think the ties would look nice either. Then a friend of mine suggested weaving the plastic sheet in and out between the rails on the bannister. That was so easy and it worked out great. It just took minutes and I just secured the sheet at the ends.
134568,1,My 3 year old son loves this potty ring. He insists that we bring it with us when we travel. It works with both round and oblong toilet seats. Boys need to position themselves properly when urinating or else they might spray themselves. We rinse the seat after each use because urine sometimes collects underneath.
144561,1,"The Sassy Disposable Diaper Sacks are perfect for dealing with stinky diapers and are ultra convienant. We keep them under the changing table and have some in the diaper bag for when we're out. They hold the odor in well and have a pleasant light fragrance. They are much more cost efficient than having to invest in a Diaper Genie unit and refills. If you have a dog, they double and doggie doodie bags as well. Definately a parent must have and a great baby shower gift!"
161806,2,"This item sounds great but the truth is, that it's a lot more trouble than it's worth. I used the tub about six times of which 3 times it leaked. I kept re-reading the instructions on how to lock the tub and it still leaked. My son kept slipping off of the infant holder until his head was down in the water. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM - IT IS THE WORST TUB I'VE EVER USED and I have 3 kids."
17870,2,"I came on this website to find if anyone else had the same problem i have had with this mobile. The situation with the batteries being drained in a day is exactly right. This mobile stinks. I went through numerous batteries, including rechargeables, and NiMh. This mobile drained the batteries like crazy. Horrible mobile. I will never recommend this."
40140,1,"Pampers are the best. They are soft, smell good and work phenomenally. I have heard people complain that babies can ""poop up the back"" of these diapers, especially breastfed babies, but I have not had this problem even though my little one is exclusively breastfed still at 8 months. I think the key is to make sure that you have your baby in the biggest size they can fit into. Even when the diapers are bigger, they fit very well. If the diaper is too small, the poop will fly. My little one is 22 pounds now, and fits into the size 3, but we are going to move him into the size 4's next time we purchase to avoid the poop-factor. Once again, great diapers."
96270,0,"My 21-month-old has been using this for her milk since she was about 14 months old. I started using it because some people seem convinced that straw cups are better than spout cups for oral development (who knows? but I guess it's worth being cautious).Taking the straw apart and putting it together for cleaning takes some getting used to, but I'm a pro now. It leaks a little when she drops it. Sometimes the straw gets backed up and overflows and I can't figure out why.However, my biggest complaint is that she has now chewed through the rubber straw. I shopped for replacement straws, but can only find them online and the cost (with shipping) is as much as if not more than buying a new cup at the store.All that being said, it served its purpose for almost seven months so it's a decent cup in my opinion. Probably worth the price, but don't expect perfection.I'm now going to try a different brand with hopes that I will have more success. I'm looking at Foogo by Thermos because it is insulated and made of stainless steel so has less chance of leaking plastic-based chemicals into the liquid. Again, who knows? but worth being cautious...Good luck!"
149045,1,"I've been using this thing for almost a week and LOVE it! It's made such a difference. Before I used to sleep between two rows of two pillows (five pillows total, counting the one under my head). It was pretty ridiculous...too many moving parts. This is a way better system. I like that it keeps you upright and makes it harder to roll over onto your back in your sleep. I usually tuck a firm tempurpedic-type pillow between my back and the inner back of the pillow to keep me even more upright as well. I see what people were saying about the shoulder seem. They should definitely fix that, but I have been able to overcome that without too much trouble."
27349,1,"I bought this because I am expecting my 4th baby on Aug 26th 2011, after 8 years since my youngest was born, and I wish we had these playpen mattress protectors with my other 3. I do have to stretch it a bit for it to fit, but I LOVE just knowing that her playpen isn't going to get germy from diaper blowouts and puke. I will have to comment on this after I have her and let you know how it holds up!! =)"
74118,1,"I thought the same thing. However I brought my infant seat into the store with me to test how the infant seat would work along with having my 2.5yo son sitting and standing in the back. At first there wasn't much room for my son to sit, but there is a flap that holds the bottom on the infant seat in place that can be pushed all the way up (yet still fitting the infant seat securely), thereby leaving a lot more room for my son to sit. Also, the seat that the toddler sits on does move forward allowing even more room. I haven't purchased the stroller yet, but I am as soon as Christmas is over."
82510,1,"So simple to install and even easier to adjust as they grow. Only downside is that it's really heavy. My toddler is 28lbs and we bought it for her, but my four year old would sit comfortably in it as well. We love it."
68089,1,"We knew we were expecting a baby girl, but we still didn't want to register for everything in pink. We wanted the bedding to work again if a little boy comes along next. This bedding has been great. The colors are very kid friendly; the bright contrasting colors are easy for them to see from early on. And the colors go with any furniture. We have receieved lots of compliments, and we love it."
22465,1,"Great playpen- all you need and the design is simple and pretty. I use this for my son, but I would use it for a girl as well as the color is more of a blue/green. We used the bassinet attachement as well for a bit while waiting for our bassinet to come in, it did its purpose, but it did sag a bit in areas after only a few weeks, so I would not recommend this to use for a full 3 months as a bassinet. VERY portable and easy to use and I get a lot of compliments on it. Everyone else I spoke to that bought a playpen with more options, wishes they did not b/c they never use any of the options and it made theirs harder to store and travel with."
83465,2,Was able to use this mattress pad a few times but then it fell apart. The seam that connects it came completely undone and it is not repairable. Very disappointed.
147363,0,"I have not tried another monitor yet so I don't have much to compair it to. The monitor worked fine in the house but when I went outside, no more than 200 feet away, there was only sound and a grainy, unreadable picture. The instructions state that the camera/lcd should work up to 300 feet depending on obstructions. It didn't. I do live in an area where airplanes fly overhead on occasion, so there may be some interference from that."
158862,1,"I purchased these for my daughter in law, and they have been the best bottles for my grandchild. The product does what it says and babies seem to have less spit up and air in their bellies.."
113297,1,"My baby loves it.I think all colours are great.Each colour is new one for your baby that's why don't worry about colour!The main I think is a quality which is quit great and the price is great you have to buy hundreds of things for you baby ,so save your money it's real well made!!!"
156663,0,"I got the Linkadoos take along swing as a gift. I started using it when my baby was about 3 months old. My daughter would flop to one side while in the the swing. It did not happen everytime we used the swing but it should not happen at all. I did report this problem to Fisher Price and they are paying for me to send the swing back and giving me a full refund. They just need to design a seat to better support the baby. Very cute product, I would purchase a new one if they design the seat better."
141225,1,"My 4 month old twins love this toy! I detach the front piece from the walker and hold it up for them to play with it. The love to watch the lights, hear the music, and punch all the buttons. I know they will play with this for months to come and am glad I got it!"
30294,0,"This really wasn't as advertised, however I knew that going into the purchase and bought it anyway. It simply made life easier, so I'd say (only because of saved effort) worth the 13.99."
3352,1,"When my boy looks back on his baby photos a few decades from now, he's probably going to think his father was a weirdo. That's OK. Who knows, maybe he'll get a laugh out of them? Certainly a lot of other people do. Hmmmm. I wonder what the kid thinks when people look into the carriage and laugh at him? When does he develop his sensitivities anyway? I guess I better not use these things overly long. In any case, I've noticed various versions of these Billy Bob Teeth, and I just had to try them out. Sorry, guy.Gary Peterson"
139426,2,"I can no longer support this product. My son loves his turtle and won't sleep alone without it. However, I have had issues getting batteries to work in the turtle, only brand that was working for me was EverReady. I emailed the company and they basically responded that this is a known issue with ""some"" turtles especially with Energizer and Duracell and they offered to send me one pack of batteries. I am going to be calling them to discuss this further but just be prepared that you too might get one that only accepts certain battery brands."
61402,1,"This monitor is okay, it's good enough. Its very cheap feeling but it does the job. It works really well actually, I never have interference and only once did I pick up my neighbor's baby. We have 2 monitors (one is a different brand) and they never interfere. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because as soon as I plugged it in for the first time, the plug box just crumbled in my hands and broke all apart!But the manufacturer sent me a new one and that was a year ago and everything still works. Good enough! No need to buy a fancy pants monitor."
128299,2,This thing is terrible! It pinches my little one's skin in the places where the potty seat folds. It is also VERY flimsy. It starts sliding into the toilet if your little one wiggles at all. And it scoots when they try to sit on it.
167566,1,"So far so good. The seat was an easy installation, is comfortable (according to my daughter), and she seems to sleep in in much easier than the old seat she outgrew. Shipment arrived within the window provided by Amazon."
54629,0,"I registered for and received this as a shower gift. It was the first thing that I set up when I got home.I thought it looked entrancing and that the music was much much clearer and less pingy than any other mobile out there BUT It didn't matter because you could barely hear it over the terrible squealling of the motor. Before my son was born I tried to exchange it for another of the same thinking that there was something wrong with mine. We brought some batteries and a small screw driver(batteries are very annoying to change) to the store with us.Well, they all squeal so I just returned it. My 8 week old son loves to watch things moving above him and he loves music but I just can't decide whether or not to go back and repurchase this item."
121468,1,"We bought this two years ago after we had my son, and have enjoyed using it. It's small enough to fit out-of-sight in the baby's room but big enough to hold quite a few diapers (so you're not taking the trash out constantly). I like that I can use standard garbage bags. The area in the lid is the perfect size for a Munchkin Arm and Hammer Freshener. No smell leaks out when it's closed and I like the foot pedal so I never have to touch it and I can throw diapers away while carrying a baby/blankets, etc. It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done."
92446,1,I shopped at local stores for a mattress for my cradle. This size mattress at the stores were cheaply made and cost much more. This is a great mattress and great quality. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who has this size cradle.
167195,1,"The thing I was most worried about was whether or not the seat would fit in my civic. (It's a 2002) It works just great! We have plenty of room where before (with her chicco carseat) we were pretty tight. We have the marathon seat sitting forward. I didn't ever put it backward since she's one now and over the weight limit. So, just for the record, it does fit well in a Civic! No problems there. I also love the velcro on the straps that makes it so I dont have to sit her on the straps and then fish them out from behind her. They just stick to the sides and ta-da, easy to get her in every time. Great product, I'd recommend it.Also, I wish I had bought two when they had the two for twins deal going on. For now we would have just kept one in my car and one in my husbands. We plan on having more children and this seat fits up to 4 year olds... so that would have been a good investment. oh well. I'll just buy another one in a few years probably."
137181,0,"I ordered the red bowl and love its shape and color. The spoons are a hit with my grandson, although he prefers chewing on the handle to eating from the actual spoon...perfect for his grip and satisfies his need to chew!! The only negatives I have found is that when I put sweet potatoes in the bowl (they were not warmed in the bowl), the white dish discolored and secondly, the hard plastic of the dish is a ""7""...the hard plastic that can emit toxins when heated."
173166,0,"The bottom half of this product, that is the portion that rests on the seat itself, works just fine. However, the part that is supposed to protect the seat back does not have any traction. My 3-year-old son's car seat would move from side to side when I turned my vehicle, because the car seat was not gripping the back of the seat properly. Consequently, I have stopped using the top half of this product (the halves are detachable). This product also comes with a warning that it may cause discoloration to your seat if the car is exposed to high temperatures. Of course, the company disclaims liability for this, so be careful. We live in Houston where the temperatures can be in excess of 100 degrees in the summer, and I have not noticed any such discoloration in either of our cars which have tan and gray leather upholstery. Overall, I give this product an average-to-below-average rating. If protecting your upholstery is very important to you, you might give it a try, however I suggest trying to make your own upholstery protector first out of something like cupboard-liner material."
93063,1,"I bought this a while back, but just recently took it on a trip over Christmas for a week. We traveled to a lot of different family homes and took it everywhere there wasn't a bed for my almost three-year-old to sleep in. It worked great! Sturdy design, easy to travel with (folds up small), no bars pressing in her back (unlike sleeping on my parents pull-out couch) and just her size. Even at almost three there is plenty of room for her to lay flat. We used some extra blankets underneath her, but overall she said it was comfortable. Looking forward to trying it camping this summer."
171111,0,"This is a great little album... My baby, 1.4 years old, loves browsing through it every night. We use it primarily to help him remember family members he doesn't see much... It fits 5 x7 nicely, and the insides are plastic... they stick together a bit, but they have handled drool and abuse, so, no problem there! I keep updating it constantly, and it looks like it will last a really long time. The only con is the ""mirror"" in the back. It's a reflecting material which has wrinkled A LOT from the abuse, and now now just looks ugly. Otherwise, great product."
180865,1,"We really liked this and it kept the baby busy from about 2 months until about 6 months when he just wanted to get out of there and do things more exciting. It's nice to have, worth its price, and quality is pretty good, I can give this to another child now and it still looks brand new."
82831,2,"I got this cute set for my baby shower because I had heard wonderful things about it. The little sheep is very cute, but small in size. The little music adaptor slips in and out of the sheep and sometimes falls out, but that is not what I didn't like about it.The problem with it is that I can barely hear the sounds. You have only 4 choices and even when I turn the volume up to max, the baby can barely hear it. The sounds get drowned by the baby's kicking and cooing.It's definitely not worth buying, however, the blanket that cloud b offers might be good as compared to the sheep.I am thinking of using the sheep myself while doing yoga or something to create a calm environment.Hope this helps!"
151624,0,"First of all I just want to say that if you're going to get stretch marks, you're going to get them. No cream or oil will prevent them. I used this religiously (twice a day) from the starting of my second trimester. I am 37 weeks now and gotten pretty bad stretch marks. So to sum it up, this product does not prevent stretch marks.Overall, the oil kept my skin pretty nice and smooth and it really helped with the itching. Putting it on, it smells incredible but I do agree with other users that it leaves this stale smell on your clothes. Overall, it's a pretty good product but I probably won't purchase it again."
32985,1,This is a great item. WE put towels under the car seat with our first 2 kids. Then I went and saw this at babies r us and cant believe i hadnt gotten it sooner. It helps sit the baby with his/her feet up higher so when they are facing towards the back their little neck isn't falling foward. I dont know why car seat makers dont fix this problem.
131513,1,"The potty seat does what it's supposed to, and is much better than having your little one sit on a big, dirty public toilet. The only thing is that it's tricky to use with boys, because you have to make sure that he's aiming down into the toilet and not onto the toilet seat and his own legs."
146595,1,"My 4 month old granddaughter just loves the Jumperoo. Her feet cannot reach the floor, so we put a pillow under her feet, and she loves bouncing and watching the different things move and make sounds! I like the fact that the seat revolves, and think she will too when she's old enough to figure that out. You may want to consider putting another hole in the straps so littler babies can still use it and reach the floor. I like how the seat supports the heads of littler babies, so why not have them be able to touch the floor also.I had never dealt with Amazon before, but was impressed with the delivery and had no problems with the condition of the product.Thank you"
121943,1,"I have a 2 yr old (about 25 pounds) and a newborn. I didn't get a double stroller at first but decided when my newborn was about 2 wks old. It works great for trips to the zoo, mall, walks outside on sidewalks and trails. Now my baby is 3 months and loves facing his big sis. She loves to face him and/or sit in the front facing out. We have the graco snug and ride car seat and it fits into the adapter but unless the baby is sleeping I prefer to use the stroller seat (it looks comfortable and feels more secure then the car seat in the adapter). The foot rest isn't great for my 2 yr old but she doesn't seem to mind. The sun shades are great. The stroller is easy to fold up. At first it seemed too much to remove a seat to fold up but it's not hard once you do it a few times."
114464,1,Our twins are 20 months and we have used these since they could sit on their own. We keep them in the car all the time to go out to eat. You just can't guarentee that a restaurant will have clean high chairs available! And those high chairs can't be placed at all tables due to size. These boosters can go at any table. The kids are getting big for them and we'll be sad to have to stop using them. We don't use sippy cups so the cup holder isn't a problem-it holds quick straw cups. Our kids never pull off the top tray-there's usually food on it!We can't say enough about how great these booster seats are!
147354,2,"The mobicam system was purchased for me as a gift at my baby shower. The equipment worked okay for a few weeks. After that, I can barely see my son with the monitor sitting only five feet away from him. The static and interference are absolutely horrible. I can hear my son through my bedroom walls before I can hear it on the monitor. My set came with three cameras and two receivers. One camera does not even work anymore. Do not buy this item!"
93414,1,"I have had this stroller for over 2 years now and I love it (in a different color). It held my son from the time he was 6 weeks old (that is when we purchased it). My nephew who is 6 can still easily ride in this stoller, so it will last you a long time. It's one of the only umbrella strollers on the market that has 2 storage compartments, a canopy, and it RECLINES. It also has a leg extender on it so when they are little their legs don't dangle off the end, and then it folds down for when their older. It does not have a cup holder, but it has a storage pocket on the back that you can put a drink in and it holds it great, or if you have a diaper bag or blanket in the bottom you can easily support a drink in the bottom. I have taken this stroller everywhere, up in the mountains hiking, through grass, even in snow (I walk over 5 miles daily with it). It also fits easily into any trunk and takes up little space. Look no further this is the best stroller out there."
14630,2,"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. THE BOTTLES ALWAYS LEAK AND ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING. I BOUGHT THESE BOTTLES THINKING THEY WERE THE BEST,BUT OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG. I EVEN SEEKED THE HELP OF THEIR WEBSITE WHICH ALSO WAS NO HELP REGARDING THIS ISSUE."
146018,0,"4/24/12 Edit:My son is now 10 months old and still well within the weight limits but, the spring holding one of the sides to frame snapped. Their is no fixing it and it is pretty sharp also. I called fisher price today and they are refunding my original purchase price ($62.01). I have to pay return shipping on the post and the seat hold. I also have to find a box for it... ugh is all I can say that explains it right now. Maybe this will happen again maybe it won't. Buy at your own discretion.Original Review: (2/12)We purchased this toy when our son was 5 months old and started jumping well we were holding him. He loved it the first time we put him in it a 4 months later (9 months old) he still absolutely loves it. You can not go wrong with this purchase.Also I've read a lot of reviews with people reporting that their baby pinched his/her finger on the elephant. Although I have never yet had this happen to my son I feel (after experimenting with my finger near the elephant) that it more scares the children rather then hurts them."
62835,1,"We registered for this and we have no problems with it whatsoever. I heard various comments prior to using it, for us there has been no smell, its very easy to use. Throwing diapers into the garbage is not an option for us with our dog. I find I need to empty it twice a week which for me seems like no big deal."
183705,1,"I've only had this for about 2 months but I'm really enjoying it. Most recently, we used it on a trip to Key West and Miami where we did a ton of walking. This backpack carried everything I needed and more. I had plenty of room for diapers, wipes, bottled water, snacks, toys, camera, and all my mommy-essentials like sunglasses, sunscreen, wallet, keys, chapstick, etc. I love all the pockets on the inside too. I used the changing pad a ton when we were at the Seaquarium and Parrot Jungle. It really came in handy and its nice that it has its own storage pouch so it doesn't come it contact with anything else. The insulated pouch on the side is great for carrying drinks and they're easy to access at any time. This backpack also keeps it shape well if you set it down. It doesn't fall over either. Overall, we're extremely happy with it. Also, the colors are great for my husband who felt it was masculine enough for him to carry all day :) I only have one child right now so it's not such a great item for everyday use like grocery shopping, etc. but I'll be having baby #2 very shortly and this will be great for keeping my arms free. I would definitely recommend this product for travel and for those with multiple children."
66435,0,"My baby has a weird obsession with blankets. Loves 'em. But I get paranoid having her sleep with one at night, so we would crank the heat up in our room. After three nights waking up with bloody noses, I said &#34;screw it&#34; and bought this and a humidifier. She wasn't a fan of swaddling, and after 10 minutes of having this on she screamed like I chopped off her foot. She hated the confinement of it.Really wish it would've worked out, it's such a great idea."
82211,1,Why didn't we buy this sooner. It works perfectly and we don't need to worry about our baby pinching his fingers anymore. He has also lost interest in playing with the cabinet. Easy to install.
91079,1,"I absolutely love this carrier. When I was pregnant, I purchased a different carrier, I don't remember the brand. When the baby was finally here, I realized how difficult it is to lift your baby up and into the carrier. It was WAY to hard to put my son in and out of the carrier. When you have to lift your baby into the carrier, your just praying that the legs will fall in the right place. And with new babies, you know that is not going to happen! What is great about this one is that it has slide clamps on the side so that you don't have to lift your baby to get into the carrier, you just buckle them in. Also, it has adjustable straps that are good for anyone. I'm 5'3"", less than 150 lbs, and my husband is 6'6"" and over 250 lbs. We both love it because we both can use it!"
119609,2,"As someone said, this does have it's problems. It falls over easily. Ours just turns on whenever it feels like it. My son says it's &quot;haunted&quot;. The blast of static has happened over &amp; over on it. It has woken the baby up several times. We've even gotten phone call conversations on it and they weren't from our phone! I could here voices coming out of my daughter's nursery, it was scary! The clicking noise is annoying on the receiver. The projector works but only if strapped to the baby's head so the picture comes out clearly. Save your money, not worth the cash."
112046,0,"My daughter is 10 months old and we really liked the Pampers brand when she was younger. But since she started crawling and moving around, we prefer the Huggies brand. The huggies diapers wrap around the thigh and create a nice seal. Twice, my daughter has had accidents with the cruisers where it leaked. I think this is due to the fact that the shape of the pampers create openings when she moves around. These diapers are also more expensive than the Huggies brand."
109310,2,"my son is 10 months old (has 1 1/2 teeth, lol) and likes to eat fruit, veges, meat, etc... he likes it when we put bits of food on his high chair tray so that he can pick them up and eat them himself. i thought this would be a great product for him but he never really took to it. he tried it once or twice and just gave it this weird look, like what is this? (even though he'll put almost anything else in his mouth) he's used to eating real food so he's probably not willing to put up with the thick netting to get to the real food.by the way, after buying this at this ridiculous price on amazon, i saw the SAME EXACT 2 PACK at target for $1.39!!!! I couldn't believe it. sometimes target just has random items for super cheap prices. since this product has such great reviews, i did get a couple for some of my friends. it seems like a good product for little ones who are just starting out on solids. so maybe for 4-6 month olds."
60612,0,"I have been looking for a good-sized tub where I can bathe my 2-year old and my 9-month old girls together. They love to take baths together, however they both sit up and I didn't realize that they couldn't both sit up in this tub so had to return it. It was hard to tell by the photos so if I had seen it in person I would have known. I had seen another reviews saying they bathed their twins in it, but I have no idea how that would have been posible. It seems like a fine tub for one child, however my kids like to have some more freedom to move about, which you cannot do in this tub."
8934,1,"My husband & I chose this diaper bag because it's not cutesy or girly, and he wouldn't feel silly carrying it. It's good quality and looks very easy to wipe clean (our baby's still 3 wks out). It's got nice space without being huge & a built-in, refillable wipes-holder. We did decide, though, that this would be his exclusive diaper bag, because even empty it's surprisingly heavy! My husband has no problem with the weight, and really likes it (it IS called ""DadGear""), so I still recommend it, but filled up I think it could be a pain for new mothers to haul around."
69020,1,"I have been using Pampers Cruisers since my son could fit in them. They are the best diapers. No blow outs and no leaks ever!If you find that your baby is having leaks, it's because you have to move up a size. Huggies and Luvs both leaked with my son.Cruisers never! Definitely worth the extra money!"
71262,1,"We like this chair so much that we bought another to leave at my mom's when the baby is over there. It is easy to remove the cover for washing, and the batteries are easily replaced. My son has used this chair since birth and now uses it for spoon-fed meals (we haven't gotten a high chair yet). He loves the vibrating seat and can now reach the toys."
177241,2,"I registered for and received this item at my baby shower thinking that I had found a great product to protect the crib mattress. When I took the pad out of its bag, I realized that there was a strong vinyl smell to it but figured that it would go away after I washed it, but I was wrong. Not only did it still smell, it also started to pill. I'm surprised that no one else noticed this!"
124031,1,"I ordered this because i didn't have the stroller to go along with the carseat my brother gave me. I love this product. I keep in in my trunk for days i go out, especially to shop. Very convenient. I recommend this."
37509,0,"Its a nice and convenient bag, but contrary to promised, its almost impossible to fit 6 bottles in it."
55047,1,"I spotted the Infantino sling in a local store and decided to purchase it for my use with my 9th grandchild. I used to be a La Leche League leader and tried all sorts of slings, snugglies, Gerri carriers when my children were little. I found this Infantino sling absolutely wonderful. I have a problem with a pinched nerve on my left side and have limited motion. However, I put the padded part of the strap (so the Infantino logo faces forward as it is supposed to do) on my left side, although I position it so it is not directly on the top of the shoulder but off to the side. I do not have an pain wearing it like that.My granddaughter has been sleeping 10-20 mins at a time and wakes ""ouchy"". In the sling she sleeps for longer periods of time (even a whole hour) and is very social and happy when she wakes. I found that I can even sit down on the sofa and read a book and she continues to sleep.This grandmother's recommendation -- the price is great ($29) but I would have paid more. It is a good bargain and a very good product for moms and ""grammys."""
30117,2,"This was too big for our baby, would fit a toddler better or a chunky 9+ month old. Not sure if it works as it was just too big when we needed it."
168289,1,These diapers are by far the best that I have used for my baby. Leak proof and soft against baby's skin. Will not use any other diaper...and you can't beat the price with subscribe and save!
130651,2,"This swing didn't work properly from day one, the mobile broke first. It made a horrible grinding noise. We should've taken it back. We just kept the mobile off, then a few months later the music and lights started messing up. The switch on top has a short circuit or something. Now, it won't swing and play music at the same time. For $100 I thought it would be the best. Iwas very wrong. Maybe, the newer model has improved but I'd be weary."
64777,1,My twins love their swings...they were preemies and were able to fit in the swing. My daughter is intrigued by the music and toys that hang from the top. The safety belt adjusts to fit their tiny frames.
51747,1,"I got this comforter for my babyshower. When i registered for it, i thought it was kinda cute, but when it came I really fell in love wtih it!!! The colors, the feel, just darling. &#60;br /&#62;I recommend this set for everyone, who is looking for a neutral set with wonderful colors.&#60;br /&#62;"
38439,0,"I had a hard time giving the baby a bath by myself for a long time. I bought this and then my husband hurt his leg and couldn't help me. Now I'm a pro. I can do it now without the bather, but I still like to use it. My only problem with it is that I like to give my baby a bath every night (she loves it). It always seems to still be wet/cold from the night before and I have to go without it every other night. But for the most part this bather is pretty great."
5411,1,"I had a couple Playtex Sippy Cups that were a few years old, and missing the valves to make them spill-proof. Found these online, ordered them, and sure enough they fit perfect and the sippy cups are good as new again!"
85010,1,"I am in LOVE with our woobee. We just returned from a trip to Phoenix- (a 3 hour plane ride), and our blanket was indispensable. My baby is 7 mths old and we used it constantly:-as a way to shield our daughter from the ""too bright sun"" in Phoenix-as a way to create a nice little cocoon on the plane so she could sleep with all the bright sun streaming into the plane-as a diaper changing station at the rear of the plane (on the floor)- Thanks for nothing Alaska Airlines...no changing station in the bathroom-tied onto her high chair as we sat outside eating dinner, and it began to get chilly-as a wonderful tummy time entertainer (we have the ""cow print"" which is fascinating for our baby girl)-speaking of entertaining, she will play with the ""ties"" forever, she loves twirling them, sucking on them etc.-finally, we bundled her up in it when we returned home from 80 degrees to 40 degreesI think I need at least 2 more of these. The first thing I did when we returned was to wash and dry it, so we wouldn't have to go without it the following day. Oh, BTW- my almost 5 year old boy wants one too for eating on the wet grass at the park."
15619,1,"I was going to purchase the plastic super yard to create a spot in the playroom for my now cruising 9 month old, but I saw this at BRU and got it instead. I'm so happy I did! We are using it to corner off a spot and it worked out great, we put the square puzzle foam floor under it to pad his falls. He loves it too! I would recommend this to everyone. Oh we did need to use longer screws to keep it in the wall..."
160729,1,"The first night we had our daughter sleep in her crib, we had to change her sheet in the middle of the night. Needless to say, after my husband wrestled the mattress out of the crib and the sheet off the mattress, he was beside himself! I ordered 2 of these ultimate crib sheets the next day. They are a snap (literally) to change, and every nursery needs at least one. Save yourself the midnight wrestling match with the mattress when you need to change the sheet - and go with the Ultimate!"
50335,2,"When i got this in the mail, it was all the same colors and pattern style, but it was like ballerina princess...not Camelot. I didn't even realize until i had part of the strip on my wall that there were no unicorns or castles. VERY UNHAPPY"
143752,1,I purchased this item right before it snowed and I'm so glad I did. It fit great on the car seat and it keeps my son very warm.I just loved it. No more trying to carry him and a bunch of blankets into the store.I wish I would of had this with my older children.
153724,1,"This rayshade is excellent value for money. It carries out its main function well, by keeping the sun out of my child's eyes. Its not perfect in that it doesnt cover my child's feet but I put suncream on which does the job.I like the handy pockets at the side and its very easy to attach and fold away.I havent tried any other types of sunshades but I would certainly recommend this one."
90692,2,"These pampers were the worst, my son was soaked. Every nightI Switched to o overnight ones which are great, no leaks"
137755,0,"We bought this for our 21 month old daughter as she started to show interest in shining the flashlight in dark rooms and we thought that a constellation projector would be awesome! Well, in essence, it works really well for the purpose of a more entertaining flashlight and moon identifier, but doesn't really catch her attention beyond that. It would be awesome if it twinkled or somehow rotated to keep her interest.Anyhow, it totally serves it's purpose as a nightlight, if that's what you're getting it for. We don't put it in her room for that purpose as it would totally distract her, but for babies and less active kids-- sure, great nightlight!"
142937,0,I have this at the top of the stairs so my son won't fall down and it works great when my kids don't wiggle it loose. You can open and close one handed after you break it in and it is pretty durable. But as I said my kids have gotten it loose twice so far so it is unpredictable. I know it's not an installation error because my husband is superman when it comes to installing safety items around the house for the kids!
175393,1,I loved this for my daughter starting at about 4 months because she loved it and it was supportive and portable. When she started sitting up this was perfect because I could let her sit up and not have to worry about her falling over and hurting herself. She also spent a lot of time looking at all the bright colors and the squeaking toy on there always got her attention. I stopped using it around 8 months when she started to crawl because she would spring herself out of it pretty easily.
17813,2,I purchased one of these from a tesco in the uk in 2009 for my son and it was brilliant so when I couldnt find them on sale in the uk when I had my daughter I decided to purchase from overseas. The mobile did not rotate so I requested a replacment the 2nd didnt rotate like it should either! Think may be a motor fault maybe a faulty batch!?
14355,1,"We have a 4 month old son, Quinn, and originally after he was born we used the Playtex nursers. I used the nursers for my first son without any issues. After a month and a half of the nursers (which I had forgotten in those 6 years what a pain the drop-ins were) Quinn had trouble latching onto the nipple, he leaked formula all over us and himself, and developed a sore lip from the bad latch. He would literally cry while eating.So we went out and bought one of every kind of bottle BRU had to offer. We tried them all, and Avent was by far his bottle of choice. He latched on right away very well, I loved the clean markings of how much he was eating (not like on the drop-ins), the nipples were easy to clean and you could see them keeping the air out of his belly. No more crying while he ate.We have only had these bottles for a short while and he doesn't spit up as much, he has less gas, and eats better. He is even holding the bottle while he eats. He is on size 2 nipples and is doing great on them.I only have one complaint and that's how they leak. It drives me nuts, I have to shake it over the sink before I feed him to make sure it won't leak all over the place. I don't know why this happens, I try to keep the ring inside dry, but it still does sometimes . . . other then that we are thrilled with them.I can't wait to try the sippy cup handles and attachments when he transitions to a cup, I think it's a great system."
109390,2,"Things I liked about the feeders:1. My daughter enjoyed feeding herself2. Feeders could be refrigerated with the food inside to use while baby was teethingThings I disliked:1. Hard to clean (pieces of food would stick to the inside of the mesh despite hand washing and dishwashing)2. Pieces of the mesh would come off in baby's mouth (the inside seams are loose making it easy for the mesh to come apart)3. Messy (food slobber would drip down my daugther's mouth and get everywhere, making for more cleanup than finger feeding)"
37558,2,"My nine month old has yet to test the durability of this gate. I just installed it last night. IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO INSTALL! Even with help from another person, it took two of us well over one hour to get the gate up and aligned. I did have to drill several holes into the wood banister before it was properly secured. My patience was nearly exhausted! It may be worth the effort in the long run, I will know soon, but I would not recommend this product to anyone short on patience or time. I cannot imagine that my son will be able to break through or climb over. I do not think I could either."
73438,2,"I ordered this item on Sept. 12.It had a delivery estimate of Sept. 16.It is Sept. 20. and it still isn't here.And it keeps saying there are no tracking details.This is the second item I have purchased through Amazon from Target!Skip buying anything from Target.I don't know where these items ship from, but it takes forever!Don't bother with Target.UPDATE: Jan. 14th, 2011I started using this product on Nov. 15th, 2010It just died today after only 2 months.Again, skip this product."
180774,1,"My son loves this playmat. I really like the size of it and at 8 months, my son still enjoys it. It plays to all the senses - lots of colors, sounds (rattles, music, crinkly leaf noise), textures (different materials, tails & ribbons on the mat) and taste (haha my son likes to put the different toys in his mouth). He absolutely loves the mirror and will spend awhile staring at it. The best part is that you can take any of the hanging toys off for your child to play with it when they outgrow the gym. You can also rearrange the toys to change things up a bit."
55792,1,"I'm quite convinced now that late pregnancy and early post-partum are probably the worst periods of time to try to figure out gadgets that don't have clear instructions. In my case, although there was a warning that a basket should always be used in the warmer, my brain erased that comment with the subsequent paragraph that said wide mouth bottles don't require the lift out basket. To be clearer, in both places it should say that the large basket is always required (otherwise you are heating the bottle directly on the plate and also in boiling water... both of which are no-nos.The instructions are also too simplistic. The type of bottle one uses (shape, size, material) will very dramatically affect how the heat from the steam impacts the solution being heated. I would also imagine that some further tweaking will be required as the composition of breastmilk changes during the day and over the course of the post partum period.For example, I used 9 oz MAM Ultivent (BPA free) translucent bottles that are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. In my successful experiment with water chilled in the fridge to about 40 F, I needed to add 2x the max level in the provided measuring tube to get the water up to about 80 F. The unit was on for about 6 minutes until the water all vaporized. This is more than 2x the amount generally recommended in the instruction sheet and the sticker plastered to the side of the unit has even less detail.Note that if you make the mistake of running the unit without any basket, some overheat sensor will trip before the water is completely used up after about a minute or so.Given that there is unlikely any product out there which monitors the temp of the solution being heated (or is otherwise aware of what kind of bottle/solution combo is in place), trial and error and patience will be required with any such product. Life will probably be easier for formula babies since formula doesn't change over time!Good luck!p.s. a water softener with regular applications of rust-inhibitor solution, or the use of distilled water will probably reduce the amount of cleaning required. Using vinegar to remove mineral deposits is the age old standard for cleaning everything from pots and pans to humidifiers etc."
174732,1,"Purchased this entire set including wall hangings, pillow, hamper & bedset. All very cute - cuddly - great colors and great dimension although the pillow is cute it is smaller than I expected. Great little accent piece."
41200,2,"When my son was born three years ago I tried seven brands of diapers, from store brands to name brands and finally stuck with Pampers because they leaked the least and he tended to have less blow-outs with them. I loved the mesh because I felt like it helped protect his bottom. In two and a half years he only got two minor diaper rashes. When my daughter was born I again went with Pampers because I trusted the quality of the brand. When I switched from the swaddlers to the cruisers I bought a huge box and when I opened it I thought I had made a mistake in my purchase as the diaper was completely different from the old cruiser, however the box looked exactly the same. After using the box and buying another to make sure I had not made a mistake, I was disappointed to see that they had changed the diaper without saying so on the box. After about two days of using the new cruiser's, my daughter got her first diaper rash and it was a bad one. Since then she has had three bad rashes. I truly think it is the new design. Supposedly this new diaper is improved and fantastic, but I think it sucks. The only difference is that it doesn't sag as much as the old cruiser. This to me is not worth the diaper rashes. My next box of diapers will be a different brand and I again will have to search to find a diaper that will work well for my daughter without giving her the blistery-red blotchyness. I am so disappointed in the change and will not be buying them again."
30003,0,"This is a fine product for the price. The quilt is really cute and all accessories are holding up very well. However, the bumper doesn't tie at each corner, it does fall short at almost every side. The crib skirt is pretty flimzy and difficult to put on. But it's a pretty set and I think worth the low cost. Also, I wouldn't describe the blue as any variation of navy; it is much lighter, more like cornflower."
55551,0,"Overall, this is a lifesaver. It is a great product, but the little measuring cup provided is difficult to fill up to the right line (which are really close together) and too little or too much water tends to over/underheat the bottle. But this saves time over boiling and is healthier/safer than microwaving. Gave it a 3 because it has it's ups, but it's downs become irritating when you use it 5-7 times daily!"
120771,2,"According to Proposition 65 warning on this page, dreambaby gate contains chemicals that is known to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm. Unfortunately, I contacted both amazon and dreambaby but no response so far! I hope this is a mistake as I currently have two sets of dreambaby gates."
43965,0,"This bag is gorgeous visually. Well sewn, ample pockets, beautiful fabric in terms of both quality and print. It's similar in looks to the much higher priced Petunia Picklebottom bags and garners oohs and ahs wherever we go.The downside is the stap and backback feature. The ""gromets"" (??) that the straps attach to are on the back of the bag. So all the support is in that one location. This is a soft and ""floppy"" bag with no inside structural support. So essentially you are anchoring the entire contents of the bag on the back side only - so everything sags forward and just hangs, weighted uncomfortably. A better design would have affixed one strap attachment to the front for the shoulder harness or something. Instead you need to always have the ""grommet"" side to your body (regardless of wether wearing as a backpack (obviously) or as a shoulder bag)and strategically pack it so it has the best possible weight distribution inside. Even still, you can't keep it on your back unless you are carrying a single diaper and clothes only - otherwise it's floppy weight hitting your tush.I bought two, returned one regretfully and kept the other because it was too beautiful to give up. I'll complain about it until it wears out, but at least I'll look sharp and stylish whilst doing it.[...]"
165953,0,"I had some leaks with these and they have a strong smell. I am getting the LUV's instead which smell a little less, hold up just as good if not better and are cheaper."
144313,1,We purchased this car seat because of its known quality. So far it is great and I have to say i was worried about the material but my daughter loved it as soon as she sat in it. We even were thinking about taking it off and putting it in her crib so that she would sleep better.
56279,1,"Great color, but not too much. Very well made, I would used it all the time if my babies were not unusually large. I did use it a ton up until my baby reached 20lbs at 6 months and it was great, still looks brand new, I recommend this to every new mother I talk to!"
46663,0,"We bought this travel system a couple months before our son was born. We haven't had any problems with it, but after reading these reviews, I have had my concerns about using it. I am wondering, if so many people have had problems with this stroller collapsing, then why aren't there any complaints or lawsuits filed against this company? My husband has done everything he could with this stroller to test it against collapsing. I really don't see how this could be such a problem when you can hear the stoller lock into place with a loud click when it is opened. There has to be something some people are doing wrong or not making sure the stoller locks into place before using it. The type of problems mentioned here could seriously injure a baby and cause a serious lawsuit against this company, so I would think Baby Trend would have put out a recall long ago if there were a problem with this stroller.****UPdate*****I returned this stroller shortley after writing the above review in Feb. Babies R Us took it back without any problems, but I had not used the stroller, only the carseat. I just did not feel comfortable using a product that was known for these issues and could not take the chance with my precious baby. I had actually received an email from one of the reviewers, R. Braddy, who sent me a link to a story on her local news about the incident she had with this stroller and her little one. That is what helped me make up my mind."
47242,1,"I researched tons of strollers and finally decided on this one. None of them are perfect but this one seemed to fit my needs the best. (I have a 3 month old and a 26 month old)Pros:- Very light- turns very well- fairly easy to fold- kids seem to like itCons:- If you are using the infant attachment you have to take it off every time you put it in your trunk. (I have a mid-sized sedan) It doesn't bother me that much but drives my husband crazy.- It doesn't stand up on its own when its folded. We have to make sure that the wheels are locked and then prop it up against something. It's a bit more annoying then I thought it would be.Overall, I am happy with my choice and would recommend it to others with children around the same age."
84697,1,I bought these as extras in case I lose some as my son gets older.
98288,1,"I bought this mobile instead of the one that matched my nursery because it plays Brahm's Lullaby instead of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and it also has a mirror hanging down from the middle; my son loves mirrors. It is also not quite as loud as some other mobiles, which I really liked. Unfortunately, wind up mobiles do not play for very long at all - 1 1/2 to 3 minutes, absolute tops, and you have to be careful not to overwind them. I then bought a battery operated Fisher Price Starry Night Mobile for 25% less, with lights and music (5 songs) which so far I like better. My son likes this one, too, so I gave it 4 stars."
1194,1,Baby Dry is the ONLY diaper I'll EVER use. I have tried every other kind of diaper (new mom) and I am sticking with baby dry forever. I have NEVER had a leak with these diapers- my son is over a year now. They also don't smell like urine when wet. This diaper is highly reccommended and I would suggest people to not even bother trying anything else because you WILL wind up realizing that nothing compares to baby dry!

126525,1,"I was always using Pampers dry for my little one, untill it started leaking for her. I switched to huggies snug dry and no more leaks. Though I always found pampers to be more softer on the skin then huggies , but its less leak proof then huggies. With huggies snug dry I never had a single leak incident."
165186,1,"still the best diaper around, after 16 months of regular testing. i have found these are better for my tall slim baby versus a short stocky kid. huggies don't do well on her, so i imagine they would work well for shorter babies."
36293,1,"We went with this bedding set because we didn't know if we were having a boy or girl (had a girl, she's 3 mos old now) and my husband I both liked the color scheme. We painted our nursery sage green with trim the orangy-gold color in the fabrics. I found a cute coordinating yellow-gold fabric with stars on it to make curtains (didn't use their valances).Like many others, however, I was disappointed with the security of the ties on the bumper (it does go all the way around my crib, though). I took out the sewing basket and sured up the stitching on the existing ties and added lower ties where there were none (make sure you use something that won't fray in the wash, I made that mistake the first time). It was worth it to me since we did so much to make the room match this set."
111128,1,"I didn't buy this with my first baby because of the price. It seemed like a lot for a piece of cloth with a strap, when you have so many blankets already. I ""splurged"" with my second and bought it though I am more cooridinated the second time around. AND you would be hard pressed to find another baby product that makes you and your baby's life better than this does. Sounds extreme but...seriously- you can see your baby- no more squirting and where is my baby's mouth?, your baby doesn't get over heated, doesn't get confused - I'm under the blanket where's mommy?, and with a happy baby/ happy mommy- nursing in public is so, so much easier. If you buy any of the endless array of products they try to sell you to make your baby satisfied- buy this one. The one that you will use several times a day, everyday. Wouldn't you spend that much on a new cute top you wear a few times? (I can't tell you how many older mom's are really jealous that they didn't have something like this or how many people tell me how cute it is!) Buy this for both of you. Buy this for every friend you've got. Be cute, be healthy, be happy."
82564,1,"We have a 2 1/2 year old who has used this seat since she was about 18 months old. It truly is a great sturdy seat that is based on Recaro's racing seats. Total, we have four of these seats. One for my husband and me, and then one for each of my parent's vehicles. The seats have been installed in an 03 TrailBlazer, 85 Monte Carlo, 08 Full size Chevy Pickup truck, 08 HHR, and 08 Buick Van. It fits in all vehicles well and easy to LATCH in the late model vehicles.Our daughter fits very well in it, and I love the fact that it is will grow with her. I think of the approx $300 price tag by dividing by the number of years she will be able to use it. I can't put a price on my daughter's safety!The only two cons I have seen is the price and the hand wash only cover. (I must admit I have washed mine in my washer on the 'handwash' cycle and let it air dry with no problems.)I 100% recommend this product!"
176217,1,"I had a premie who was low birth weight. I had problems getting my breast milk in and he was a bad burper. Switching to these bottles made his feedings more productive and let him sleep more comfortably. Much less gas than other nipples and he didn't care if it was breast or bottle when I used the avent bottles. It allowed his Dad some valuable bonding time which allowed me healing time! Unlike the experience of the other premie mom, these saved me!"
184813,0,"I got this Pack n Play as a replacement for a cradle for my 10 week old twins. They were sharing a cradle during their first 2 1/2 months. I loved my cradle for moving it to and from the bedroom to the living room but it was time to move on. Now, I have the Graco pack n play in the living room and they use a crib for night.Pros:The pack n play is wonderful because they each have their own section and are no longer kicking each other. Its big enough for them both to be sleeping in it. It was not *that* hard to put together.Cons:Biggest con is that is sags towards the middle so both girls tend to roll to the center like a bad, soft mattress. Do they mind it? Not really although you want to be careful that they don't get stuck with their bodies pushed up against the center wall.Also, don't expect to move this. It is large enough that it doesn't fit through standard door ways. Once we put it up in the living room, it stays in the living room. I think we could probably break it down to take on vacation and put it up once in a hotel room or grandparents house but I would not want to break it down and put it up new everyday. It's not that portable. Also, it a struggle to put a sheet on. Nice thing is it fits a crib sheet pretty well.Unknown --I haven't tried to use this as a playpen yet so perhaps it won't sag when I do that.Would I buy it again? Probably because they just isn't anything better on the market for twins."
37947,1,"Great diaper bag. This is the first baby for my daughter and son-in-law and he is a total Dude, so this will work great for him."
809,1,"I have not found a cheaper way to obtain diapers. Sign up for amazon mom, and/or recurring shipment and get the best price w/free shipping!"
117621,0,"The jumper itself is wonderful. However, when I put my 6 month old son in the jumper I could immediately tell the strap it hangs from is too long. We hung it from a traditional height doorway, and my son maximized the height of the jumper. Within a month i had to tie a knot in the strap to make it shorter so my son could continue jumping. Otherwise, he was jumping from his knees! Overall it's a great jumper, and he absolutely loves it. I just wish there was a height adjustment on the strap."
2301,1,"With Pampers, you know what you're getting - a durable mess catcher. By buying this with Subscribe & Save & Amazon Mom Discount, you will be paying less than you will in any brick & mortar store, and you don't have to worru about carrying it home."
48960,1,"I bought this play yard for my puppy. It is super easy to set up and move around. It folds up easily and fits well in my trunk for trips or under a bed or in a closet for storage. It is sturdy and has plenty of room. I leave it set up in my yard. It has no metal parts to get rusty and it hoses clean. It has a 2 piece extension you can buy to make it even bigger. This will be big enough for my pup when she grows up. Great product, great price!"
43248,1,I got this to go with the Graco carseat and I have had no need to buy any other stroller so far. It's extremely light but perfectly sturdy and very maneuverable. The basket is big enough for a light grocery run and it's accessible enough that I can get to the diaper bag I stash there. The only drawback to it is it doesn't have a space for a bag to hang on; but since the basket is pretty accessible it's no big deal.
148997,0,I like the pillow with one exception. The top area where you neck lies is straight across. It pulls taught and makes it feel as if your neck is sleeping on a rope. It is very uncomfortable. I have to put a blanket there for padding. I would also suggest having a king size bed. We have a queen and between me and that pillow my poor hubby is nearly falling off the bed.
85232,1,"Love this pillow!!!! Makes getting comfortable so much easier, and getting to sleep even faster. I am 22 weeks pregnant and it helps support my back and belly, also helps take pressure off of my hips. I for sure cannot sleep without it. I like that it has a removable pillow case."
155385,2,Our 13 month old pulled these off the corner of the crib and table within seconds. They became dangerous chew toys in a matter of seconds.
32378,2,"Subtitle: Taking Money From Excited Parents-To-BeMy wife and I bought the deluxe version of this product (that comes with two sets of headphones, a microphone and speakers to talk/play music to the baby, and an elastic strap to hold it to your belly) early in the pregnancy. We took it home and tried it and didn't hear anything. But we chalked that up to it being too early.We broke it out again at around 25 weeks. Nothing. But it was still pretty early.26, 27, 28, 29 weeks. Nothing.Then at 30 weeks.... More nothing.We tried this all the way up to delivery (37.5 weeks for us) and we could never be sure that what we were hearing was the result of our baby moving as opposed to the mic just picking up every micro-movement.The problem is that this is just a cheap condenser microphone that is held up to the woman's belly. Holding it by hand definitely won't work - you can't hold your hand still enough to prevent the microphone from picking up small vibrations.But we also tried this with the included elastic strap (that isn't even included in this set) while my wife was lying down in a quiet room with both the ceiling fan and even the AC turned off.Sure, we heard.... something.And, at the time, we really, really, REALLY wanted to believe that what we heard was our baby. But in the end I'm afraid that most, if not all, of what we heard was just very small movements of my wife's belly.If you've ever used an acoustic stethoscope, this product sounds similar to what you hear when handling the tubes leading from the diaphragm/bell to the earpieces. Kind of a ""pfff pfff *thump* pfff"".The following is from the (current as of this posting) Wikipedia article on electronic stethoscopes: ""The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor."" That is the technology used in this product.In summary, if we had it to do over again, we would rent/buy a dopler microphone or just go without."
59729,1,We love this bath tub! We had the First Year convertible bath tub first...horrible. Our son slipped all over the place and you could not get all areas cleaned because of the set up of the tub. We love the Euro Bath! It is large enough for baby to have splash and play time without worrying about them slipping. I love the fact that our son can continue to grow with this tub! Don't worry about buying anything else!!!!
8224,1,This basket is really gorgeous - nicer than the picture looks. Perfect for either gender. Looks like baskets that were much more expensive. Bigger than expected. Very happy with this purchase.
177961,1,"I bought this sippy cup after reading about this cup on other sites. I wasnt intending to buy this one first but when I saw it in the store I thought okay.... I'll give it a try. I had a hug leak the first time we used it, but I fixed it and we have had nothing but happy sipping since. We travel alot on the weekends and its nice to have a cup that will keep milk cold for more than 2 hours. That alone is worth the purchase!"
8358,1,"I really like these sheets. They're soft, they don't fade in the wash, stains come out easily from the fabric, and they look good. They're simple and easy to put on a standard crib mattress. I bought the yellow, purple, and light blue, and they look great. They're pretty cheap, and I'll be buying more when these sheets get old.One last thought, the reason I gave the sheets four stars and not five, is because they are a little thin. Not so bad that it matters a whole lot. If you're uncomfortable with the mattress showing through a little, get a mattress cover."
9673,1,"We've had this for 2 years now and its an excellent product. My son is 5 already and he still using it because its in his bedroom and he doesn't have to go all the way downstairs to pee if he doesn't want to since there is no bathroom upstairs. I love how I can just remove the insert and take it down with me on my way down, its small enough it can be rinsed out in the sink. So we use it long after he's potty trained its just a useful little thing, and portable if you need to take it on a trip or somewhere. My only regret is not buying it sooner. This would make an excellent gift for a baby shower!"
164334,2,The price was great for my twin grandsons. After a month both babies developed a severe rash from the baby dry diapers. Other Mom's have said the same thing. Now they have switched to Huggies.
8755,1,I bought this booster seat for our 18 month old son. It was perfect - he liked sitting in it and engaging with mom and dad for meals. Only thing it can't do is clean up the mess after the meals..:-) I felt the soft cooshie construction would be a safer than the plastic models I have seen. My son is active and if you slide him completely under the table he does not try and climb out. The travel bag makes it really easy to carry when dining out or at Grandma's. I highly reccommend this product.
114670,0,"In late June, I ordered this for my visiting grandchild, a six month old boy of slightly above average height and weight for an infant his age. He is certainly not as big as any one year old The dinner tray had to be placed on the second of three settings for distance from the back of the seat to comfortably seat him. The space added by moving the tray away only allows perhaps one inch increments of space. Since the baby couldn't sit up two months ago, and I presume he will continue to grow, this seat will likely need to be replaced by Christmas. Size aside, the product is well made., light weight, very portable, and mostly easy to clean. The ""mostly"" refers to the webbing for safety belt, anchoring and carrying straps; which aren't removable. I read another reviewer's comment about this and wisely chose a seat with colored webbing rather than white (at least juice and veggie stains will be less obvious).-For other Grandparents; this is light weight and easy to travel with, How much easier to stow away when the babies aren't around than the standard highchair. My only reservation is the size. When my grandson doesn't fit anymore, I will be keeping it for my Grandparents' loaner network. Ooh, maybe more grand babies?!"
137722,1,"We love it!!!!!! Love the material it's made of, won't scartch or damage anything if falls, easy to operate, many colors to project, love the booklet it comes with!!!"
79631,1,"I Had almost 6 months trying to teach my Baby girl to use the toiled.I tried everything but this (from asking every 5 minutes to Punishment).When i give her the PRIMO Freedom Trainer (Toilet Trainer) as a gift, it was the last they she did not use the toilet, exactly as it sounds...no more diapers!Item is:Easy to assembleConfortableSecureMess ProofI recommend it"
37477,1,This comanies placemats for kiddos are awesome.They are very durrable.My kidds have a couple and they love to sit andpoint things out that they know or to ask questions.
54054,1,My husband is a CHP officer and we have two mirrors for our twins. We move it between the mini van and the SUV depending on what vehicle we are using. The straps fit over the headrests and we can see everything our babies are doing and they love looking at themselves too. I recommend it.
60517,1,"DONT EVEN BOTHER READING THE REVIEWS, YOU'LL WASTE YOUR TIME. WHY? BECAUSE THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING AS MINE AND THEY ARE ALL TRUE. BUY THIS TUB!!! I have an 18 month old daughter who used it up until she was about 15 months, but that was because she likes my garden tub better. Otherwise, she could not have had happier bath times anywhere else. I worked for 4 months after she was born and my mother-in-law who is not as strong as she'd hope to be thanked me so much for getting this tub since she would babysit for Ashley while my husband and I worked. She said that it was so much easier for her since she didn't have to hold up Ash with one hand when she gave her baths. It does have a very miniscule flaw in which it is BIG and hard to find a place to store it, but if you have a second bathroom like I do, I just leave it in the tub to dry. My husband and I are expecting our second child and I'm not even putting a bathtub on my registry because I'll be using the one we already have. I also bought one for all my other fellow mom friends and they loved it! You will not regret this buy!"
148847,1,"I don't know how anyone can make it through their pregnancy without this pillow! Im not sure what all the fuss with the seam is about because I don't notice it at all. The amount of support is perfect and in just the right places, even my husband likes to lay snuggled up with it! (It also makes making love a lot more comfortable) I would highly recommend it!!"
4400,1,"My husband and I put this bag on our registry on a whim figuring nobody in their right mind would pay $80 for a diaper bag. We were thrilled when we received it at our shower. Our baby was born in mid December and we loved this bag. It went everywhere with us. It holds a dozen neborn diapers in the inside pockets, bottles, formula containers, toys, clothes and even a snall blanket depending on what else you've packed. the easy access wipes are great and I love that the changing pad stores in the back zipper pocket rather than taking up space in the main compartment.The diappointing part was that it didn't hold up. The bag itself has held up pretty well even when filled to capacity (and then some). The strap however, has not. The webbing used to make the tabs that hold the rings where the shoulder strap hooks on (attaches) to the bag itself is poor quality and began to unravel and fray by late August. It was very frustrating. The only reason we had even considered this bag was that it was big and sturdy and would last at least a couple years. Instead, I had to purchase a new (inexpensive) bag from a local store in about eight months.Assuming that we just got one of a bad lot and the rest are fine, I would highly recommend the bag. If, on the other hand, this poor quality webbing is the norm, I suggest you look elsewhere."
180617,1,"We have 2 of these for our twins. They love the different beads and textures. They are always chewing on one. They don't seem to go for the bugs much, but the solid beads seem to be a favorite. I highly recommend."
129048,1,"I have 4 boys, ages 7,5,3, and 8 months. We live in Michigan and our school district does not have buses. My husband takes all 4 boys to school in the morning, back at noon to pick up the kindergartner and back at 3 for the 2nd grader. My 3 year old and 8 month old were miserable until we got this cover! It is amazing. They now sleep while waiting for their brothers in freezing cold ( 7 degrees today), wind, rain or snow! It fit perfectly immediately over our Eddie Bauer Tandem Stroller. The stroller folds up with the cover on. We have not removed it since we got it! It unzips over either seat so the loading and unloading is done quickly. Excellent purchase for anyone who needs to be outdoors in inclement weather."
34107,1,"We just returned from our trip and I have no complaints about this product. My husband was embarassed to use it when we first arrived at the airport, but he admitted it was necessary since we were pushing a stroller and carrying two diaper bags. We gate checked the car seat travel bag to ensure the car seat would arrive with us at our destination. The bag survived without any damage."
30183,1,Unable to give 5 stars due to not using product myself. It was bought as a gift and while the parents love it I dont have anyway to judge durability or how it functions. But if they love it thats all I cared about.
83376,1,"Kinda bulky to keep in the diaper bag, but works great for more than formula.... snacks, rice cereal, etc"
182003,1,"This is the best product for little boys. As soon as we received it, he wanted to use it...and he did. It is just his height and he loved to flush it himself. I just wish we would have bought it sooner."
60898,1,But my husband wanted it on the registry. And we both love it. It is very convenient. Contains smells unlike a regular garbage could.
82843,0,"I had a very colicky baby that was very difficult to get to sleep for the first several months. After that much sleep deprivation, I was DESPERATE for anything that might help get him to sleep. So I bought this sheep hoping the white noise would help. It wasn't anything magical, but I do think he liked it. I'm not sure it made him fall asleep, but I do think it helped him stay asleep a bit longer. The white noise both helped mask our sounds when we were tiptoeing around the bassinet in our bedroom, and also helped provide nice background noise for sleeping for him. He mostly liked the rain noise. My baby also had a hard time with all the noise at daycare, so we brought this with him for naps and it helped drown out some of the ambient noise and encouraged him to keep napping. I think its a very useful product. I do think the small size is probably sufficient though, and frankly I wouldn't have wanted anything bigger in his crib."
148570,1,I got this for my wife fairly early in her pregnancy based on the reviews. It works well and keeps her comfy and keeps her on her side where she belongs. She's 7 1/2 months along now and still using it -- now I want one!
178333,1,"My wife and I received the carrier a few months before our baby girl was born. We couldn't be happier with the fit, color, and comfort. Highly recommended!!! Even our cat likes to be carried in the BabyBjorn!"
84136,1,"Very good quality changing pad cover. We have a flat changing pad, and it's difficult to find covers to fit it. This one works well, although it's not elasticized all the way around. The cotton is good quality, though, and the selection of colors is excellent."
122522,2,"I'm sorry to say I've been duped, it's my fault but if you are the kind of person that reads Amazon reviews before ordering, this one may come in handy. I wanted a whole bunch of plastic glow stars for my daughters' room, I quickly read ""over 700 stars"", a brief description, and ordered. Most (over 500) of the so called stars are nail sized stickers, not actual plastic stars. I must be honest and say that when I re-read the description of the contents, they did mention it in the product page. The stars are ok, the product doesn't get more than two or max three stars as a review, most of them are fairly small anyways. I'm not saying not to order them, just read carefully. There are much better products in the market."
7879,1,"I think these work okay. My 15 month old son is able to hold them and scoop some food on to them and get them to his mouth. The only problem I see is when he is trying to eat with his left hand. It doesn't work so well because these are just right handed untensils. Other than that, they are sturdy!"
93479,1,"I bought this potty for my daughter after it was suggested to me that I buy one with a high back. We had been using a seat on top of the ""big"" toilet but she didn't like being up so high so she would only use it for BMs, never to tinkle. As soon as we brought this potty home and put it together she sat down and took a tinkle. She was so proud of herself she brought both my husband and myself over to see.We haven't had any problems with leaks though I can see how that could happen with a boy. Also, you have to take special care to make sure the ""pot"" clicks all the way in or you could have quite the mess on your hands. I couldn't tell you if the music works, I never put batteries in, but as for general function we're pleased."
126355,1,"I have tried Pampers, but have come back to these. The main reason is the elastic band at the top is helping prevent the blow-outs. There have been occasional leaks but much less frequently than Pampers.Little Movers are softer and slightly smaller"
63709,0,"My baby liked this cart cover right away. Brightly colored and comfy, he never whined once during an hour long shopping trip. However, I'm only giving a 3 star because the loops for attaching toys broke within 5-minutes and I cut myself pretty well on the manufacturer's packaging (those plastic corners are SUPER sharp)."
28489,1,I love this chair so much I convinced my daughter to buy one.It arrived quickly and was very easy to assmeble. It is my favorite piece of furniture
95182,1,"Very fast and efficient, first had the cheaper model of Medela, that one really cant do the job, this one is great."
87714,2,"Instructions for cushion installation are very poor. They consist of a series of pictures which are too small to read. In addition, they are printed on a reflective surface which makes things even worse. The manufacturer's website is also not helpful, so you basically have to figure out how to do it yourself. The key is you need to realize that the oval white strap adjuster (which goes behind your baby's back) has tabs with a gap in them. You can slide the straps out through that gap. Then you can install the cushion, run the straps through the cushion slots, and finally reattach the adjuster.Other than this, we like it! Once you get it installed it looks good."
1444,1,Cheap and good. Really good wipes for the price..smooth and strong. I recommend it to any age baby or child.
180883,1,"I bought the Fisher Price Rainforest playmat based on the reviews from others and based on how much my baby loves our other Fisher Price items - the cradle swing and papasan seat. At first, my baby would fuss when we placed her on the playmat, but now that she is older (2 months) she really loves to lay and stare at the different rainforest animals. Though the music may drive many adults nuts, the Fisher Price people have really honed in on the type of music and rhythms that babies like. It's nice that the rainforest animal components are detachable and that there is a multitude of sensory stimulation."
42567,0,"We were determined to ""wear"" our daughter as much as possible, so the Moby was a natural choice. We started using it right away when she was born (6.5 lbs) and it worked okay. We needed something flexible for different sizes - daddy is thin, mommy is not. It worked well for this; I just tied in the back, not under the baby in front. The hardest thing is adjusting it. It takes a while to get the hang of how to wrap it on, position a baby and be comfortable for more than a few minutes. It seems to stretch just enough to be loose after a few minutes, no matter what hold you use. This means the baby sags down, and then must be adjusted as soon as they have fallen asleep...no good.Now that she is 5 months, we use it around the house, but much prefer our Ergo when we are out. It is warm, like wearing a second shirt in addition to the baby's body heat, so now that we are approaching summer, I doubt I will use it much."
107341,2,"This was a great idea, however the diaper champ does not deliever on its promise. At first you think it's working well at 'trapping' in the odors, but in reality newborn diapers don't really have a bad odor. Once the baby starts to eat some solid foods, that's when the odor really starts to get bad and the diaper champ does not seems to be able to trap the odor well. Also, I had a difficult time pushing the lid from side to side because the blue rubber ring around the top started to pop up and catch on the bin. So, I had to use two hands to turn it instead of just stepping on the foot pad and pushing with one hand.I would not recommend this to anyone. It's a waste of money!"
76788,2,"I ordered this stroller because the price was right and it looks pretty durable. Assembly was simple. It is very difficult to steer, the wheels are plastic and the front two have no swivel option. I took it for a test drive around the block and it was horrible to maneuver going up and down hills. Seems to work okay on the flat areas. I received it yesterday and have decided to sell it already!"
47588,1,"One of the best ""baby"" purchases we've made. Our LO is almost 6 months old now, so it is time to move her to the nursery. The co-sleeper made life much easier for us."
38924,0,"This was one of those &quot;I've got to have it&quot; items that was on my registry. I used it a few times and then that was it. It does work well at cushioning, but I found that my son wasn't immersed enough in the water and would start to get cold as did the water that collected on top of the cushion.I also got the Evenflo Infant to Toddler bath that has the built in (removable) inclined, cushioned insert that worked quite well instead. With the insert removed, the cushion made a perfect fit, I just found that I preferred the bathtub insert more."
162818,1,"We love the snack trap! We bought them for our 15 month old who loves to dump whatever she is eating on the floor. Unfortunately, that is not appropriate in church. So we fill these up when we are in the car, at church, at a friends house, or just for breakfast. We love them!"
24198,1,"I don't know what I would do without this swing. It puts Lucy to sleep when she is SO fussy. We use it for several hours every day. We have been using it since the day we came home from the hospital. I let her nap in it! It is often the ONLY thing that will put her to sleep. And it entertains her when she is awake and I need a few minutes to brush my teeth or wash my face or eat.If you are expecting a baby you HAVE to have this swing! I think the noise that it makes is soothing to her and she loves the music, so does her mommy :)The one thing I don't like is the mobile because I don't think it is interesting enough. We don't have any trouble with the mobile falling to the back though. I taped baby faces to the tops of the poles for her to look at instead of the mobile because babies like faces. Now when she is awake, she likes to look at those!We bought rechargeable batteries, and when I am leaving the house for a few hours, I put them on the charger because I am terrified that the batteries will run out and we will have a fussy baby and no batteries for the swing. However, we use it several hours a day and the batteries have never run out!Overall, I don't care that I don't like the mobile because I COULD NOT LIVE WIHTOUT this swing! It is the greatest!"
90875,0,"I got a sample of this diaper sent to me by Pampers, and I absolutely loved it - so soft and luxurious, it was the perfect diaper. The problem? I loved it so much that I went out to buy a big pack, only to discover that the actual product was not as soft nor as smooth as the sample. I was VERY disappointed, and honestly, felt kind of cheated."
157794,1,"Our daughter was born 3 months early. When she came home, we bought this monitor. It was wonderful. We were totally at ease. It only went off once and then her breathing was shallow. Our only dislike about it is that the alarm should last longer. I would recommend this for all parents."
47902,0,"*WARNING: I did almost lock myself inside his room once the first day I installed it. I had the gate handle in open position and swung out. But we closed the room door. The gate must have swung back towards his room door but with gate handle still up. I did not know that when the gate handle is up, it blocks his regular room door handle (it's a lever one). So I could not push down on the room door handle lever, it's like if a chair was under it. Luckily the gate has these small footholds which I remembered so I used a clothes hanger and stuck the hanger thru the gap under the room door and pushed the gate away from the door...phew we were able to get out. Now I just always make sure the gate handle is always in down position even if not locked closed.But it does the job I wanted it to do. It is blocking off my son's nursery doorway.The clear panel gets kinda gross from hand grease I guess since my son's always putting his hands in his mouth. But easier to clean than rails I would say.Handle is hard to open but that's a good thing for little curious minds. Same with the latches that allow the gate to extend.I screwed the hinge side in and pressure mount the other side. I'm not sure if I installed it wrong but the bottom bracket on the hinge side is not flush with the side of the doorway. The bracket is a little loose but the screws stay in place though. Gate only came with spacers for the top bracket and not the bottom. Why is that? The screws are drilled as far as they can go in though so that is the only thing keeping that bracket in place.I like that it swings both ways. My son can climb up to stand but cannot climb over it because no rails and he's not tall enough. He pats his hands on it often and still stays in place so far. I installed it so that his real door can still close when not in use. When not in use, I just keep the gate open and close the door."
42303,1,"I got the Moby when my baby was about 3-4 months old. I got it because she wanted me to carry her around all the time and I wasn't getting a thing done. I researched several different carriers and was impressed that this one was so versatile. There are many different ways to carry your baby in it, but some of them are for smaller babies, so I wish that I'd had it sooner so I could have taken advantage of those. I still used it a lot, though, just not as much as I thought I would. My daughter is developmentally delayed and so she couldn't hold her head up when most babies could, and this limited the ways we could carry her in it. It did free up my hands so I was able to get more done, but you can't really bend over with it on so you are still limited as to what you can do while you're wearing it.One of the problems I encountered with the Moby itself was that it did shrink quite a bit when I dried it, but it does stretch back out during use. My advice to someone who buys the Moby is don't be afraid to wrap it fairly tight before you put your baby in because with some of the positions it really stretches, almost to the point where it's uncomfortable because it sags so much and you have to take baby out and redo the wrap. Also, even though it is a pretty lightweight fabric, my baby would get really sweaty in it and so I couldn't leave her in it for too long.Overall it is a good product, very innovative. My husband used it sometimes too, which was fun for all of us."
136579,1,This crib bumper is fine. Works as described. The ties are a little tricky to use with our particular crib style.
94359,2,"I found the nipples EXTREMELY hard for a new born baby to suck on. I used the Playtex bottles w/ the disposable liner and it made my life much easier. In the playtex starter pack, there are also nipples of different sizes and shapes so your baby can decide whe one she likes."
5310,0,"I purchased this bag so that we could check our MacLaren Quest stroller. While it's true that the bag is padded it is only padded in the upper smaller portion where it unzips. The rest of the bag is un-padded and that's where it left me a little nervous since it offers very little protection for the stroller itself. To put me at ease, I wrapped the more fragile areas with blankets and padded with some diapers. I also asked the airline to stick a ""Fragile"" sticker on there to lessen the chances of it getting dog piled below a bunch of heavy bags. We successfully made it through one round trip but I'll definitely continue to pad it and ask for the sticker."
71983,1,Love this carseat and the fact that it will grow with baby and actually last until one year old! Wish I would have had it for the first kiddo!
80514,1,It is the best I have used so far. It draws the moisture away from the baby. So far no diaper rash. I love this very much and will recommend it to anyone.
72755,1,"This is my favorite stroller to date, and I've been through six. It folds up for saving valuable room in the car trunk, it folds up lickety-split (after half a dozen times you'll get it down pat, and yes you do need two hands), and it's comparable to an umbrella stroller, but much better. The only thing lacking is a cup holder (for the driver). It's also the stroller we take if we are flying somewhere."
117291,1,Great product- works great and looks nice too! Much more attractive than other similar products.
142259,1,"Our baby loves this. She really enjoys being able to see the world and feeling safe and secure. We recentlly took her on her first trip and this was a lifesaver in the airports. No stroller to lug around- it was perfect! My husband is nearly 6' and I am 5'3"" and both of us use it. My dauther and I decorated the Christmas tree using this. She got to be part of the fun and I had 2 hands free to use. She was only 4.5 months! We highly recommend! It's worth the price."
57313,1,"First bought only 1 of these for my nephew's 7th birthday. His mom liked it so much, I ordered 3 more (he has a younger brother in the same bedroom as he) and now they EACH use one for laundry and one for toys. Looks like it will last forever! I DEFINITELY would recommend this product to a friend or family!"
132786,1,"Before I gave birth to my son, I reviewed lots of different diaper pails and found the most positive reviews for this system. We actually had to order the pail from Amazon, but we found the refills at our local Burlington Coat Factory. I love it! I have never walked by and noticed a smell at all (although when you take the bag out to tie it--whew!!!). It would be nice if it was a few inches taller to accommodate more diapers, but we keep it in our bedroom and it just looks like a small, lidded wastebasket, not a bulky, obvious diaper pail. I plan to use this with all our kids. I don't use this pail exclusively now that we're in a 2-story house, but all the ""upstairs changes"" go here. I highly recommend this!"
141127,1,Bought this toy for my grandson who was turning one last month. Both his 2 year old and 5 year old brothers love using it in all of its aspects. So far it seems very durable and hopefully will last many years.
133949,0,"My 4 month old used to tense up every time I would use a cold wet wipe. So after hearing so much about wipe warmers, I went out and finally bought one. Now he laughs and smiles when I change his diaper instead of crying. But, the major problem that we have is that there is too much water in there and constantly spills out off the lid every time you open it, and it also dries out the wet wipes too easily. So you have to check the moisture on it almost every other day. It's a real pain (...) especially when you have too many other things to worry about. Plus, have the best of luck on finding the everfresh replacement pillows. They're not as easy to find as you would think. (...)"
155368,1,I am a caregiver to a 93 year old that always bumps into furniture and breaks her skin open. These Toddler Corners cuts down the possbility of an accident and we love them.I have put them on the corners of our glass center table...and she feels much safer.Thanks. Alba Xochihua
64619,0,Great quality bag with nice hardware and great design. I loved it the 1st time I saw it. Only disappointed with its weight...it's heavy even without any contents (3.5 lbs). Wish the shoulder pad was removable also.
68007,1,"Used this 3 times (gate checking planeside) and it kept our Maclaren Volo clean and intact (have had the canopy pulled off during prior gate check). I was pleasantly surprised that the bag is hole-free and is going on another trip with us. I don't expect it to last forever but I would certainly buy another at this price. BTW, bought the padded JL Childress Ultimate car seat bag and IT got holes in it after gate checking on 3 flights!UPDATE: After using 1 more time, the bag has torn at one seam. I sewed it up and the bag tore at a different seam the next flight. Great concept but the fabric just isnt made to endure muliple trips."
28824,0,"I, like many others, was attracted to this product due to the low price ($129 at the time of this review) and the favorable consumer rating on Amazon.Initially, this was everything I was lead to believe; comfortable, seemingly durable and excellent at helping soothe my little ones at night. That was the first 10 months. Shortly thereafter things began to unravel fast, starting with the arm cushions that no longer stay snapped on (yes, they are snapped into place and at an awkward angle that seems designed to ensure it loses grip over time), then came the seat support springs that randomly dislodged from their mounts until I used some gorilla glue to hold them in place. The arm rest frames themselves started to become loose, no matter how much I tightened the applicable screws, and pre-drilling & installing wood screws through the cheap material in an effort to reinforce said arms only made it worse due to cracking.Finally, one of the bearings blew out, pretty much rendering this chair useless since it squeals like a banshee everytime you use it.All in all, we got a good 12 months out of the product before it became more detrimental than beneficial to use. I don't feel like ~$10/month was a bad value for a throw away piece of furniture, but in hindsight I would have probably invested in something that was higher quality and more durable."
95489,0,I gave this 3 stars because the size of the toy hammock is exactly what I wanted but the minute I opened the box the smell was unbearable. It is such a strong smell and there is absolutley no way Im putting it in my kids room or even my house. Im going to try and let it air out for a day outside and if that doesnt work its being returned.
14429,2,"I fell in love with the Avent bottles when I started working in the infant room at my work. But, the bottles never gave me any problems then. So when I found out I was pregant I went out and bought [price] worth of bottles and nipples. When I started to feed my newborn they would leak from the spacing between the bottle and ring. For the price that I paid for these bottles I would expect a better product."
3286,1,"These blankets are amazing! Both of my children are swaddle sleepers and these blankets are nice and lightweight so they don't get overheated, but yet they hold them nice and snug so they don't wiggle out of them very easily. These blankets are what helped my kids be able to sleep through the night as infants without waking themselves up. I would recommend them to any new parent."
48877,1,"A MUST for crawling babies and toddlers. Way better than a pack and play. Very durable, easy to fold up and take to grandmas, you will use it every day. Gives baby room to roam and keeps them safe."
85838,1,"This handle works great it is very stong and hold very well on the shower wall, I always test that it is stuck and it always is.. great product"
13235,1,"I had seen Mighty-tite in our local Babies R Us store and ended up getting one for each family member who would be driving my son around. I had always felt so secure with it, because it left no room for his carseat to move. We, recently, made a move four hours from family. One morning, early this past October, while driving home on the freeway, we were in a horrible accident. With just the two of us in our car, we rolled four times, from the South bound lanes of our interstate freeway, across the median, coming to a rest in the fast North bound lane. Lucky for us and others, there were no cars around us at the time. I will heal. My injuries were a lot worse than my son's. I believe, as do our rescue workers, that the position of my son's carseat (rear center) and having Mighty-tite, taking up the slack of the seat belts, securing my son's seat so tightly in place - the only injuries my son sustained were the bruises left by his carseat restraints. I cannot give the creator of Mighty-tite enough credit or praise. If not for this device, my heart would have an unimaginable ache in it today. Thank You. This accident showed me that as safe as we may feel on the road, we really don't know what's in store for us. Now, we're looking for a Volvo and I'll be buying Might-Tites for each friend and family member expecting a sweet little baby."
8008,1,"I like this product, it fits very well the changing pad and it's quite soft to my LO skin. I have been using for at least 6 months and the fabric is still soft."
42331,2,It was easy to follow the instructions but still it was not easy to use and felt unsafe to keep my 5 month old in it. My baby struggled to stay in it and it was not very easy to get him in. I would still stay with other brands of baby carries with the straps and clips. Just feels safer with the other products.
144581,1,"We started using these when we noticed that my sister, a mother of 3 and the daycare we visited prior to the birth of our daughter both used individual sacks for diaper disposal. When combined with a simple diaper pail that uses kitchen trash bags (we empty ours twice per week), there are no diaper odors to worry about."
121825,1,"We purchased the boppy for breastfeeding, and it works wonders for being able to support the baby! But this thing has 1001 uses. My husband uses it to prop his arm up while holding the baby, the baby can sit in it, can lay on it for tummy time, we can use it as a neck pillow, and a lot of other things! I would DEFINITELY recommend it to anyone with a little one!"
164949,1,The pampers diapers that I get delivered to my house from Amazon are terrific. They work for both of my children who are 2 years old and 11 months. They are very absorbent and fit my children nicely I would reccommend these diapers to anyone.
95458,1,Maybe about 40-50 dolls in all kinds of sizes are now in this hammock. looks nice and also saves lots of space! I can use all the space now with other stuff. Love it. Highly recommend this item!!!
181494,2,This product is not really 25' it was only 24'. It also already broke. Before it broke it tangled going back in every time. I do not recomend!
80725,1,"My daughter has been wearing Easy Ups for what seems like forever - she finds them so much more comfy than Huggies Pull-Ups - but when I saw that Pampers had changed their size names I didn't know what size to get her any more!I called Pampers Customer Service to get the low-down and they told me that that the new 2T/3T is actually the same as old Size 4, 3T/4T is Size 5, and 4T/5T is Size 6. My daughter has been wearing Size 5, so I ordered the new 3T/4T, and sure enough, they're exactly right. That makes both of us happy."
145372,1,"I bought this based on the recommendations. My son used it from about 5 months old to 10 months so it wasn't used a ton but it was good when I needed to get stuff done and he could play or bounce. One tip-if your baby is not able to touch the floor (as mine couldn't at 5 months old), put a pillow underneath their feet and the'll be able to use that to touch."
102854,1,"I read one other person review and she was complaining. Well, regardless of this item being a gift to me at my shower, I probably would have gotten it anyway. My son is 8mos and it works just fine to me! I don't care what trashcan you use, unless you change your baby outside when he/she poops it's going to smell! All trash smells if there is an odor to it. You, have an odor until you get rid of it. So why would you hate the fact that your baby dirty diaper needs to be changed and you have to keep it for a short time, that's foolish. Babies don't come potty trained, wish they did, but they don't! And I think we have it real good compared to when I was a baby and my parents had no other choice but to smell the dirty diaper they don't have the luxuries we have today. Some parents had to use cloth diapers! Hope I don't offend anyone but, some people can be so spoiled. If you can't smell your own babies&#146; dirty diaper for a little while then you need to think about it next time before you have anymore. Anyway, once the lid is closed you can't smell anything, when you open it you can, but how long are you going to keep the lid open, unless you are changing the bag. I do like the fact that I can use a standard bag it saves you money. But, all I need to know is, can I use any deodorizer?"
96426,1,"I am not handy, but this was easy even for me to install! Took about 2-3 minutes per door. The locking mechanism sometimes slips off the track when you open the door (which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars) but it is a very minor inconvenience and can easily be put back on track. Overall, very solid product and our little one hasn't cracked the code (yet)."
108448,2,Seat has too much foam and top and bottom piece will not stay latched together. Would not buy this seat again.
123024,2,"We bought two different Fisher Price potties- one for upstairs and one for downstairs- just in case :) This model is way too sensitive. If my son so much as twicthed, the potty told him he had successfully peed. In the beginning, he thought he was pretty hot stuff! Finally, I turned the thing off and he just sat on it and told me on his own when he was done. The other bad thing is that the splash guard comes off way too easily. Every time I'd turn around, my son would have the thing in his hand which is not a good thing when training a boy! My son has rather generous thighs and when I'd get him off the potty, the splash guard would come too!"
95350,0,"After reading all the wonderful reviews from this site we decided that this would be the perfect monitor. It was inexpensive and everyone spoke so highly of it. We've purchased two of them in less than 2 months - the first one worked for about 1 whole month before it went to nothing but static - before the static it was a perfect monitor...very sensative, we could hear everything, but once the static came across that was all you could hear. Our second monitor (the same exact model)worked for the first two weeks and now, depending on the channel and the time of day, we tend to pick up more static than anything else. Just recently the monitor has begun to &quot;mute&quot; out any loud, hi-pitched sounds (like a crying baby) I'm beginning to feel that this monitor is not a reliable one, at least for our area - maybe we're getting interfearance from other homes in the area - I don't know - we're going to return this one and try a 3rd one of the same make and model - hoping that the 3rd time will be a charm we'll see how long this next one will last - I do agree w/ the other positive responses that it is a great monitor and very sensitive - but only for about the first 2 weeks - at least in our household."
58995,1,This sterilizer is the best. I use it everyday. It holds bottles and parts from my Medela breast pump. I would be lost without it. It is easy to use and can hold anything.
105360,0,I have not used a Diaper Genie or any of the other systems. The diaper champ worked well before my daughter started on solids and the diaper started to really stink. Now the poopy diapers go in a plastic bag tied and in the outside trash. The champ really does not keep the smell out. We only use the champ for wet diapers. Another annoying thing is that the diapers often get stuck when you try to turn the handle. We found that you need to shake the pail every once in a while so it makes more room and then it works.It is great that you can use regular bags. You can change the bags more often and this helps.
150232,1,"I havent 'used' this yet, as my baby isnt here yet, but I did wash it and put it on the changing pad. It fits great and is very soft. I have other covers that I used with my son and this is by far the softest."
68435,1,"I purchased the Cosco booster seat as a spare seat for my 5-year old to have in his grandmother's car. Earlier this week, my mother and son were involved in an accident that resulted in a total loss of my mother's car. But the Cosco booster, along with the car seat belt kept my son strapped in tight. I am going back to buy additional Cosco boosters for our three other vehicles."
108577,1,My brother in law says it gets in those dips at the bottom of the jar.
145506,1,"Length:: 1:17 MinsI got Noah (my 4 month old son) a Rainforest Jumperoo for Christmas...and he absolutely loved it!! We did have to put a box underneath it so he could bounce, but once he got the hang of it he didn't want to stop! He especially liked it when someone played with him.. :) It was a Great Christmas gift, and I'm really glad I got it for him!!"
12973,0,"It did the job, but it was not very durable. Within the first week my son knocked it down and broke the corner. A piece of duct tape was all it needed for a fix, but still for $20 i expected it to last a little longer."
32658,1,"After a lengthy search that included high end dressers with changing tops and $50 plastic options, we settled on this because it gave us space for baskets and had a drawer... and of course wasn't too expensive. The instructions to put it together weren't very good, but we figured it out. It looks sturdy and fashionable, similar to pictures online. I haven't used it for our baby yet, but I think it will do the trick."
56735,2,"We received this basket and returned it right away, because not only did the basket get smashed during shipping but the handles fall in towards the baby's face. The depth of the basket also isn't as good as some of the other ones we looked at. While the interchangeable colored ribbons and cloth material is ok, it seems that the basket just isn't very sturdy. We later bought a Tadpoles basket and were happy with that one, even though the price was more."
59625,0,"I got this when our daughter started walking. The crawling never concerned me too much as she never seemed to be an ""unstable"" crawler. Once she was on her feet I was a bit concerned about our hearth which is slate not brick. This does stick to the slate pretty well and stays adheared until she rips it off. Once it has been taken off once it does not stick back on very well, you have to use another adhesive strip. After a while she was pulling them off more than leaving them on so we just gave up. But by that point she was beyond the ""crash into everything stage"". My sister in-law had less luck with hers but she has a brick hearth and had a 2 year old and twin babies so the three of them pulling at it was a losing battle. It did help us for the few months that we needed it and I am sure well use it again with our baby who is due next month."
14707,1,"These bottles are by far the best out there! I easily switched back &amp; forth from nursing to bottle-feeding with these. Also, I could pump from my Avent pump right into these bottles. Great for when my husband wanted to feed our daughter! I bought them for my sister when her son was having problems with gas &amp; spitting up. The Avent bottles helped so much! These are the perfect size for newborns. I love these bottles!"
1365,1,These diapers are amazing for babies that have a longer torso and a smaller waist... We tried Huggies on our baby boy and he always wet out of them. The only time that he wets out of Pampers is when it is time to move up to the next size!! I am a HUGE fan of Pampers!
133499,0,"At first these bottles seemed like a godsend. Our baby had struggled with Avent and Adiri brands. The soft nipple seemed like a really good design and feedings went really smoothly and quickly. She seems to be slowing down a bit now despite using the #2 nipple and we have yet to try the #3s (which I think would be too advanced for a 5 week old)so I guess the jury is sill out. They don't leak and are easy to clean. Overall though at this point I would say these are very good quality, well designed bottles."
137111,0,I cannot give these bottles 5 stars. I like them...but my son does not. My favorite feature is included in the starter set which comes w/ little attatchable formula cups for powdered formula. You can measure how much you need and push it on to the bottom of the bottle. Great for on the go. Formula cant spoil and no need to heat up cold milk. Can cozies work perfect on these to help keep milk cold. My son is a bottle fed baby & has a problem latching on . He cannot get a good seal on the nipple and becomes gassy from swalling to much air. My advice would be to try these bottles but only open and use a few so if your child has the same problem you can return the unused bottles.
4818,1,"I was using Huggies for my son until I read about 7th generation. I was looking for a bleach-free diaper and this was perfect. It fits very well, holds up great and is very reasonably priced, especially thru Amazon. Haven't used any other brand since switching to this one. Highly recommended."
106061,0,"I like some features of the Diaper Champ. I do not find that it is odorless at all. I do like the one-handed operation of it. However, my toddler is constantly putting things in it and I have to paw through the dirty diapers to see what he's thrown away before I dispose of the bag. Using regular trash bags is nice, but I think there is something to be said for scented liners."
68801,1,I bought this item with the 30$ off for 100$ pampers coupon. I like and have been using Pampers for my daughter for long time.
62907,0,The overall function of the daiper pail is awesome. It contains the smell extremly well. However the refill process is still quite complicated. I also find that it is very noisy so we save nightime diapers until morning as to not wake the baby.
48317,1,"I received this as a gift and I love it. My daughter is 6 months old now and this product was so helpful during sleep training as well as those nerve racking newborn days. I can ""peek in on her"" with out disturbing her. When she was learning to fall asleep on her own I was able to see that she was ok without running into her room and waking her all the way up everytime she let out a cry. The monitor works all over my house includding the basement and even out in the yard. The only thing that I don't like is that it will let out a loud static sound from time to time. It is also pricey...but if you can swing it GO FOR IT!!"
98392,1,My one year old grandson had outgrown his plastic infant bath tub and we were looking for something to use in a textured tub as all bath mats seem to be made for non-textured surfaces. This works great -- he's comfortable in it and it doesn't move around in the tub -- has a hook to hang it from the towel rod to dry. He loves bath time!
173335,1,"Our son loved this item until he was too big to use it. It held up very well, seems like new still. Looks great with our home decor and is functional."
90611,2,As soon as I got these diapers I was surprised at how light and thin they were and I was also worried about the absorbent pad not running all the way to the back. The next day my fears were realized and I got poop all over my shorts. It leaked right out the back. These diapers have a cheap look to them and they perform that way too. I still have about 240 of these left so it will be a long month! My wife thought it was pretty funny though.
86989,1,I used these when I was nursing. These are the only bottles my little ones liked. I love not having to sanitize bottles. These are so convenient. I recommend!
104888,1,"I had bought these wipes so that the big 'ol box of seventh generation refills I purchased would have a container. Little did we know how much better we'd like these wipes. They are absolutely fabulous, soo thick and they clean very well, not to mention they're better for babies soft skin! Although Seventh generation is a great product (especially the diapers), if you're going the all natural route or have a baby with sensitive skin these are so much nicer than seventh generation (a bit too thin and skimpy for my taste). These wipes wont disappoint!"
14058,1,"I bought these bottles because my lactation consultant recommended them to me. Now I really like them. I did have to buy an adapter for my Medela pump so I could pump directly into them.That tells you I breast feed and use bottles. I have never had a problem with both methods.As far as buying the nipples for these--at 5 months, 18lbs and a solid food eater, my baby is just ready to move to the #2 sized nipple. So there might be something about how quickly the milk exits the bottle with the nipple.I was just at the store and realized that there are adapters for these bottles to turn them into sippy cups. What a deal and money saver. With the wide mouth, they also make good baby food jars. So, it's money well spent when you can keep using them as the baby grows.I have notices some leaking, but it's really when you over screw the top."
77906,1,"I travel in airports alone a lot with my daughter and this has been a lifesaver. We travel mostly to cold climates from Chicago so we always have winter coats also and they fit in with the Britax Marathon Car Seat that I have. I always buy a seat for my 17 month old so I take it on the plne with me and the wheels help me when I also have the stroller and bags and all the other stuff you need!!! I gave it 4 stars just because I can see where it could tear easily, but still love it and have bought 2 (only because I misplaced one)!!! I have also put my neice's taller Komfort Kruiser booster seat in the bag and it also fits nicely!!"
722,2,"I purchased this package of 222 diapers size 3 and it is already 3rd time (from out of 10 changing) that our baby got whole his body covered with those jelly pieces from inside the diaper. Scary, i hope it is not toxic or something."
54037,1,"this is a great mirror for when the baby is rear facing and you are the only one in the caryou can see what the baby is doing while you are driving, by looking into your rear view mirror."
69153,1,"These are by far the best diapers available. I especially recommend this diaper for those of us who are a bit lazy in the diaper changing department. These diapers can hold a ton without leaking. As for Amazon's service, diapers were supposed to ""Ship within 24 hrs"". Diapers actually took almost a month to get to me. I had to go to a store to buy several packs to keep from running out. Complaining to Amazon did not help."
124422,1,"I read up on some other competitors and finally decided to go with this one. I absolutely LOVE IT, and I HIGHLY recommend it! It does not come with a separate carrying bag because the product itself folds into its own bag. It is a bit bulky (but still neat and cushiony for baby) if you are carrying other items, but it has a small double strap to use for carrying it. The best workaround for me to get it to work with most all highchairs is to 1st sit the baby in your lap (or get a helper to hold it), and put the baby's feet/legs in first. Then, you can easily sit the baby in the high chair, and the buggy bagg follows suit. You can then fold the sides down. I have had many people to ask me about it and who also like it. I also enjoy the zipper pouches in the back flap for putting extra items in. This is the best out there for what it does."
30811,1,I bought it to bring breastmilk to a nicu in order to feed my son. It keep milk very cold. Easy to carry and handle.
137977,1,I love this product. I have used it since my daughter was born. I recommend it all of the time.
46078,0,"This mobile keeps my 1 month old interested, but the quality of the product is undesirable. The top card does not form a nice 90 degree with the bottom once it is inserted. We only wish the cards can be a little easier to change."
159611,1,"I purchased the ""Itsy Bitsy Bouncer"" for my grandson who just turned three months old. It is not easy to recognize that a three month old really really loves his present, but let me tell you, there is no question about how happy he is when he is in the this. The seat is soft and comfortable for someone his age, the spiders are all smiles, and they move. He seems to enjoy the music, and he clearly enjoys the fact that it vibrates. My daughter has many pictures of him smiling, taken in the bouncer. She says he will ""talk"" to the spiders for long periods of time. He is just contented and happy in this clever, well designed toy. Whoever imagined this knows what babies enjoy most!"
163597,1,"I bought this for my granddaughter, primarily as a space saver instead of a stand-alone high chair. My son and daughter-in-law just love this high chair. It fits perfectly on their dinette chairs, cleans easily, and is perfect for their small home."
87430,0,"...with this set, it only comes with one sealing ring to store breastmilk, so you can only store one bag at a time. It would have been more convenient with atleast two more. (...), but I just think the price is a little too high. Overall, it is a good idea to have this starter set to conveniently store your breastmilk and transfer to a bottle without spilling a drop. The breastpump adapter ring fits perfectly on my Evenflo breastpump, so it is so much easier than to keep transfering my milk to another storage container."
66095,1,"Has reduced gas and spit up!! My daughter had been very colicky with pain passing gas, spitting up, and pain with bowel movements. The fact that she is lactose intolerant made matters worse. I had tried the playtex ventaire bottles, avent, and evenflo comfi. My cousin recommended Dr. Brown's b/c her son had the same problems, and they have been a lifesaver for us!I highly recommend these bottles they are worth EVERY penny!!!!"
107493,1,"This rain cover fits perfectly on my jogger stroller.Pros- It works and it lasts. Thank God! I purchased this to replace a cheap plastic cover that I bought online late one night. Big mistake. That plastic cover was useless in the wind and rain - I guess it was made for a nice warm sunny day!- Light material which means it is easy to fold up into a small bundle.- Folds nicely into a small pouch.- Mine came from Target with a nice small pouch - not sure if this is standard with all purchases.- Large window for Bub to look out. Before I used it, I was not sure how my daughter would feel inside, based on some other reviews. My daughter felt claustrophic inside the useless plastic cover so I was anxious. As it turns out, the window is very large and my daughter was happy peering out from her captain's seat.- This uses ties to attach to the stroller which I love. The old plastic cover had velcro which always risked waking my daughter when I opened it.Cons- This is a quality product. I cannot fault it. It looks like it will fit most, if not all, strollers. So, it you have a ""special"" stroller, I would suggest you check this fits.ConclusionIf you want a rain cover for your stroller, get this one."
92040,1,"This a splurge since it's kinda expensive- but it has been great!This was bigger than I expected, so I use it to organize my diaper bag (which is always chaotic). I store my changing pad and use the outside pocket for diaper wipes and the clean spare diaper. This is such a bonus!I originally bought it for cloth diapers. It works great for that purpose too. Besides, what prettier thing could you want to store your soileds in?"
65933,1,It might take you awhile to figure out how to take apart and put together the bottle but it works great! My son hardly spits up from it (only from over eating). I have no problem with it leaking as long as the top is twisted on correctly. I highly recommend them.
42318,2,I was introduced to this baby carrier by one of the instructors at a prenatal education classes that I attended who raved about it. I decided to buy it and try it on my twins because it was less expensive than the other baby carrier styles. My babies didn't take to this carrier and didn't like being placed in this at all. Putting it on was a pain too. Ended up returning this and now have a BabyBjorn carrier.
99491,2,"My daughter was wearing the Huggies prior to this. I ordered this diapers, thinking that they would be softer and more absorbent than the Huggies. To my surprise, they are neither softer or more absorbent. I'm very disappointed and have had to change many skirts, and pants because of this!I am planning on writing to Kimberly Clark as well regarding this. Also, these diapers run small!"
18927,0,"The bundle me is fine, however you can pick similar items up for cheaper at local stores.It is very lightweight, not suitable for colder climes."
89595,2,"I ve always been a pampers user.. used cruisers size 5 for my son 2 yrs old and 32 lbs and they were great at daytime and used huggies overnight at bedtime...my husband got a giant box of these by mistake from a store , they were cheaper so I decided to give them a try.. BAD DECISION.. not soft at all and they leak after one hour of wearing them, terrible.. and they are smaller than cruisers so they don't fit well.. DO NOT BUY"
9237,1,"There are ""fancier"" potties out there, potties that serve as a potty and also double, triple, or quadruple as a step stool, ""big"" toilet trainer seat, toilet paper holder, or provide positive reinforcement in the form of cartoon characters, music, and who-knows what else. This potty does none of that. It doesn't even have a lid to cover the bowl. But those other potties, the ones with the neat designs and features, they are good at a whole lot of things, but not so good at being potties, in my experience. This potty is just that - a potty...but it's a really terrific potty. It's comfy for kids of different sizes to sit on, isn't huge, and is a cinch to clean. And most importantly, with our old potty, my son never peed without spraying out of the bowl...since we got this potty, he's never sprayed pee anywhere but in the bowl. That pretty much says it all!"
144552,1,"These bags are very nice. Big and the handles tie nicely, just be sure to double knot. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because the baby powder scent is very strong, a little too strong for me."
17346,1,"We bought this monitor about one month ago. We can hear and see my daughter clearly. If it does not work in the future as I have read in another review. It will be returned and I will get the money back even if that means that the whole toy store will her my voice.It should last, you should beable to get your moneys worth. We will see!"
16499,0,"This is a good product, but putting it in a tub is messy! It's really creamy and just gets everywhere. I ended up getting a plastic spoon and scooping it out onto a cotton round. This product is easier in a tube. Other than that- it's great for preventing diaper rash."
93548,1,"My 2 yr old loves this potty! She had been very reluctant to start training so I let her pick out her own potty and this was it. I admit the music was a little distracting at first, but we got used to it and now I always know exactly when she is using it on her own. I have not had any problems with it leaking, but do wish that the bowl was a little harder to remove because she likes to try to empty it herself which has resulted in several messes. Overall I am happy with it's value for the money."
151992,0,"I've loved this for years for my first three children. But number four learned faster (from the others) how to climb up on chairs and use tools to access things...so it was a piece of cake for him to grab a broom (or toy lightsaber, etc.) and just slide the lock to one side by himself. I wish I could find a 2-step lock (like twist and slide) that could defeat him."
31287,2,"It is a great space saving design, but as noted by other reviewers, does NOT work with glass bottles. It's very cheap flimsy plastic. The polls on the bottom layer started to bend over with the glass bottles, and what is worst, after 1 day of usage the top rack collapsed to the bottom because I was using glass bottles (and not all the prongs were even used). I ended up getting the Skip Hop Drying Rack, and it is working very well for me. I only wish they could make a STRONG two tier design one day."
24293,1,"I got my arms reach mini cosleeper used. In great condition, but the sheet that came with it didnt match. And it wasnt safe. I couldnt let my baby sleep on it. I looked and looked to find the right sheet for the best price. With 2 toddlers and a newborn I have to try to save money where I can. And the sheet I found here was the cheapest all around once you add shipping to it to. It fits perfect on my mini arms reach cosleeper and the velcro holds it in place. Its nice and taught. Washes and drys with no problem. I love it!"
83160,1,"Bottom line - this is probably the most useful &amp; important piece of baby gear we've gotten. While it was a bit awkward for the first couple of months, I soon discovered that our infant loved to snuggle up against my chest in the sling (couldn't with Mama...). Then as she grew, both my wife &amp; I used the sling to travel with &amp; soothe our daughter. She's now a year &amp; half and we still use it as a hip-carrier - and she often asks to ride in the sling for some parental comfort.Most baby gear is totally excessive, but this is simply essential for the whole family!"
96891,1,"I make it a point to buy this for every baby shower I'm invited to. It's just adorable and every new parent seems to love it, especially since it plays the mother's heartbeat for the newborn to go to sleep to. The little lamb comes packaged beautifully and is one purchase I can recommend without hesitation!"
85189,1,"I bought this pillow in order have a body length pillow on both sides when I turn over in bed. That theory worked out pretty well. It is really big! Now that I have had my baby, I am trying to figure out where to store the thing! Ha ha.It comes with a zip on pillow case. This isn'the softest fabric in the world and might be a point for improvement in the future.Overall, I'd suggest to friends to by this pillow."
32371,2,"I tryed these on my toilet. My One year old still would get in the toilet. One piece broke. Good think I had 2 of them:) I tried again. Same thing this time. After a few attempts, he could get in. Then they just came ""unglued."" So, maybe they will work on you toilet, but not mine."
73353,1,"i read the negative reviews on this item, but decided to purchase anyway - i am glad i did! it doesn't do everything.. i still keep a written log of feeding times, etc. - but this little device has been AMAZING and a lifesaver in these first few weeks for both myself and a girlfriend who also has a newborn. we both love it."
5340,1,"Took this to travel on transatlantic flights with our Peg Perego P3 Stroller. The bag kept it from getting scratched etc, and the stroller fitted nicely inside. It was useful for carrying it over your shoulder to the gate, especially with a baby/toddler to carry too.The padding is great, but even though we gate-checked it the stroller still had some of it's frame bent and damaged (thank you baggage handlers everywhere!!).This bag is well made and served its purpose well."
34025,1,"You're looking to buy a carseat bag for two reasons: 1) you travel a lot; and 2) you don't want your carseat to get all gunked up by said travel. This bag gets the job done. We've flown with it several times and so far it's rip-free (not the case with our Baby Jogger bag for our City Mini stroller, which has endured the same flights/abuse). It's huge enough to accommodate our big mama Britax Marathon with ease, yet it's still light when empty. The zippers are not fabulous quality -- I feel like a good yank might break one of them, so you have to be a little bit careful. This is a very minor point and one that will probably only apply to a tiny portion of travelers, but if you use this with the GoGoBabyz wheelie device for your carseat (which is AWESOME, by the way), the bag is about 1 inch too small to get that thing in, along with your carseat. Again...very minor point but just an FYI for other savvy travelers."
95329,1,"... ON a pleasant note, the sound is crystal clear, even being adjacent to an airport and having the babys window right next to the air conditioning unit outside...above all these other noises i can still hear VERY CLEARLY my son scratching his crib sheet when he is in the process of waking up...i can pick him up before he even begins to whimper because i here such faint noises as this wake up cue. im very satisfied with this product."
157655,1,"Purchased this and installed at bottom of staircase. We have it extended to the maximum width, and it looks pretty spindly, but the thing is rock solid when it's seated in the latch mechanism. The latch mechanism is super easy to operate for adults, but our 4-year-old hasn't figured it out yet, which is a good thing. Our one-year-old, the reason for having the gate in the first place, is completely stymied by it, so it serves its purpose very well. You do have to drill into the wall (and the bannister post in our case), so it will 'leave a mark' when you're done, but due to the mounting, it's very robust. It comes with templates to mark the walls for the mounts - don't lose these; they are the only way to get the mounts right. When you hang the gate, the latch end of the gate will seem to hang below where the latches are mounted, but the gate kind of 'lifts' into (and out of) place. I'm very happy with this gate."
82097,1,"We bought this bed for my almost 2 year old daughter. I've been looking at beds for a couple months. The regular twin beds just seemed too high and the toddler beds impractical since she'd outgrow the mattress soon. Voila...along comes this convertible castle bed. It's great. I expect that my daughter will enjoy this bed until she's 6 or 7 even though the recommended age is 2-5. Aside from the overall look of the bed, my favorite detail is the nightlight.Notes:* The box is HUGE. Lying down it nearly took up the entire bed of our F150 truck. I don't know how people have fit this box in a mini-van. The box is also very heavy so let the store load it and then take it out piece by piece from the car.* Assemby instructions are easy to understand and can be completed by 1 person. However, expect assembly to takeup to an hour. The screws are tricky.* The bed itself is fairly big (wider then a normal bed) so if you have alot of stuff in your child's room (dressers etc) it may not fit.* The side rails are only a few inches high and won't really prevent toddlers from rolling. Since the bed is so low to the ground though, I don't think it's a problem."
1153,1,my 7 months old is using these diapers right now. they are so good and they fit her very well. I willl continue buying from this buyer.
68961,1,My daughter is special needs. I am so glad to have discovered this new larger size. It allows her to have the fun character diapers for a little longer.
75857,2,Be forewarned the Tempo line contains BPA in the bottles! The ring touches the milk or formula (leakage of the neurotoxin can occur!). Why create a BPA-Free liner with a bottle that has polycarbonate in it? I got fooled... I don't want you to as well! Take care. Let's keep our babies safe!
65465,1,Our son has eczema and his skin is very sensitive. We have used every cream out there from Desetin to Boudreux's Butt Paste and even Mustela's regular vitamin barrier cream but this one out does all the rest. It clears up our son's diaper rash faster than anything else we've tried. I think it's the special enzymes that they use. Maybe other creams work for other people but we would highly recommend this one if the one you're using is not working fast enough for you. It is a few dollars more than the types you buy in a drug store and it's hard to find but it has been well worth the extra money and time searching for it.
72691,1,"I used this nipple for the first 6 months with my twins and my most recent infant (buying a new set for the newbie of course!). I've never had one break or fall apart and all 3 babies responded well and drank well from them, easily transitioning from BF to bottle and back again. These nipples are pricey and the bottles will fit Dr. Brown wide mouth nipples but those are softer than these and seem to collapse more easily."
58535,1,"I was told that I could wash our baby bottles in our dishwasher and I would not need a sterilizer. BUT we live in post housing on an Army base and our dishwasher is awful and hardly gets anything clean. So I handwash all my bottles and bought this as an extra step to help me get them clean enough for my child.I really like this product a lot. It is very easy to use and since I am using Avent products and an Avent manual pump, everything fits great in this sterilizer. I can even pop pacifiers in there when they fall on the floor. There are slots for basically everything and it all stays put when I am moving it around.I know that it isn't really necessary, but I like using it for that extra peace of mind that my baby is getting CLEAN bottles. Every parent has different 'must haves' when they have babies and this is one of mine! :)"
164174,1,"We used this product for my oldest daughter who had a pretty flat head. The pediatrician recommended we go to see a specialist & get her a helmet but we decided to wait & bought this product for just under $10 and it totally helped her head. We just bought another one of these for our newest daughter for when she is in her seats (car seat, swing, etc). It stays in position nicely and fit in everything we put it in. Great product!"
87218,0,"Being a new mom, I bought this set because most of the online reviews rated this highly for breast and bottle feeding babies. The advertisement claims that you can pump directly into the bottle/liners. I also used the reviews to pick out the Isis Breast pump. When I got them both home, I found that the adapters in the Playtex Nurser don't fit the Isis Breast Pump (which now I realize is written in fine print on the Playtex Nurser, but nowhere on the Isis Breast Pump). I also can't find adapters which will work, making these two products useless for working together. Now, I am going to have to go back and buy bottles that will fit the breast pump! It would have been nice to have this information printed boldly on the package before I opened it."
132798,1,"I purchased the Dekor Plus back in Jan of this year. After 7 months, the right spring of the flap failed. I contacted customer support and we received a replacement top in less than a week. The system works great: easy to load and take out. It doesn't totally cut out all the smell but it does a good job. It can hold a large number of diapers too."
160194,1,This swaddler is perfect fr a wiggly baby that wriggles out of their swaddling or for a parent that is afraid to wrap too tight. Our little girl slept through the night if she was in this and swaddled tight enough. Life saver for new parents
24013,1,"I wanted to share my experience to help others decide if they should try a smaller breast shield. I have very prominent nipples/areolae (i.e. my areola is not flat on the breast but protrudes along with the nipple). Despite reading all the websites out there on proper fit, I had a hard time trying to figure out which part of my nipple/areolae was supposed to be in the tunnel. I experienced a lot of pain and bruising with the standard 24mm shields. Two different lactation consultants told me to go up to 30mm. The 30mm incorporated my entire nipple/areola and was even getting some regular breast tissue while pumping. Although the 30mm didn't hurt as much, it definitely was not comfortable--the discomfort was to the point where I worried that I was damaging my areola tissue because it was swelling so much afterwards. I also wasn't getting as much milk as I did with the 24mm. After looking at a lot of pictures of normal breast anatomy, I figured out that my nipple was not the whole protruding pigmented part of my breast, but just the tip (before it widens out into areola). I decided to go ahead and order these and I am so glad I did. Pumping doesn't hurt at all anymore--it is much more comfortable, almost to the point where I don't really notice it (compared to the other sizes, where I felt every single suction). My nipple fits into the tunnel without touching the sides and only a little bit of the areola goes in while pumping. If you are still not sure whether to get these, just remember that you know your body best and lactation consultants can sometimes be wrong."
126653,0,"We normally use the Costco Kirkland brand diapers, which we really like. We got all the coupons in the Parents magazines, so we bought a few boxes of these Huggies, since they were ridiculously cheap that way. They work okay, but they are so cheap and flimsy feeling. They Kirkland ones feel much more substantial, and are a lot softer on little baby bums! We actually can't wait to run out of these, so we can buy our regular dipes again! We recently bought another box of these with our new coupons, and we almost felt annoyed that we were getting such a good deal that we couldn't pass up, because we actually want to go back to the Kirkland ones! Haha! Soo, we aren't really fans, but if it's a SUPER good deal, then they are worth it, because they do the job fine enough."
72134,1,"My daughter loves this. I love watching my daughter plays and run around the table in it.Pros:Most of the included toys are great: fish, parrot, palm tree, whaleAllow the baby to walk or run safely in a confined areaWhen the baby grows out of it, detach the seat and become a play centerCons:The yellow column takes a while to assembleThe table top comes off easily(slight twist and lift)The table is top heavyThe fabric seating alignment to the seating tabs are off. It's a pain to reassemble after each washing."
108537,2,"I had high hopes for this training ring. It is the perfect size for my children, but it slides back and forth on our toilet seat and, especially at the beginning of potty training, its movement is causing some unsureness on the ""big potty.""The handles are great.Unfortunately, I think my search for the ""perfect"" aid in potty training continues."
158946,2,"These are very hard to clean and the nipples collapse constantly. The best bottles and nipples are the Avent bottles. After buying every bottle out there, we settled on those because they are stable, easy to clean, and the nipple doesn't flatten on every other minute."
72038,2,"I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat (I have two cars/two toddlers and an infant). My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser. For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway. My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel ""too snug"" in it. They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep. If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it."
112432,2,"So I received the new ""dry max"" diapers and yes, like the other reviewers are saying they have the look and feel of your average, cheap generic brand diaper with the old pampers price. Not exactly a soft and comfortable diaper like the old pampers. It's a bummer to have to look for a new brand of something I haven't given a second thought about for the last 8 months. Many are asking ""why would pampers do this?"" Here are my thoughts on the issue. As you may have noticed, there has been a major global economic downturn. Proctor & Gamble (makers of Pampers) has traditionally sold high-end products at a premium price (think Tide, crest, Pantene, Duracell, etc). The economy has forced many people to switch to cheaper brands, leaving P&G with billions in losses and over 3% decline in revenue in 2009. Bob McDonald, the new CEO of P&G, came in with guns blazing with a plan to increase profits (see USAToday's article ""Proctor & Gamble Looks Beyond U.S. Borders""). In the case of Pampers, he was left with a choice to increase profits: increase the price of pampers, or decrease the quality and leave the price the same. The problem is that he apparently underestimated what would happen if you do this to parents who have better things to worry about than the quality of the diapers they have been relying on for years. If you want to make a clear statement to Mr. McDonald, stop buying pampers. He'll get the message, just as Coca-Cola got the message in 1985 when they replaced Coke with ""New Coke"" (see Wikipedia ""new coke"" for the similarities). And soon you'll see ""Pampers Original"" back on the shelves..."
86248,2,"When our son was born we used an audio only monitor and it was really difficult to determine whether he was awake or just fussing in his sleep. I did extensive reviews on Amazon and elsewhere for the ideal video baby monitor and determined this was the best.When we received it, we installed it and loved it instantly. The picture quality was perfect and the audio is very sensitive and clear (too much in fact, we could hear noises very clearly outside his bedroom).We were actually considering installing a second video camera in his play room so that we can use the monitor to switch between both his bedroom and play room because it has two channels.However, about 2 weeks ago the video feed started giving us trouble an now it is completely scrabbled!!!:(What a disappointment!! We really enjoyed using this monitor due to its crisp colour video feed, clear night vision capability, portability and great audio. Now we have to now look for another monitor that has a shelf life longer than a year."
68221,0,"I bought the true ""original"" turbie twists back when they first came out years ago. They are getting kind of worn by now so I decided to replace them and also get some for my daughter.These towels are acceptable to use but obviously of lesser quality. The aren't all of uniform shape either. I'm not sure if that will mean anything in the long run but it just emphasizes the quality detioration to me.Finally I was disappointed to receive 3 white towels in the 6pack. It states that 2 of the same color might be received but having 3 white is not the variety I had hoped for. In hindsight I should've just purchased them at Bed, Bath and Beyond."
68337,2,I bought 2 of these for my 14 month old daughter. one of them was half full of juice and she dropped it and it cracked spilling juice all over the floor. the other one i had to throw out because the nozzle dripped. thank goodness i only bought 2. never again.
77650,1,"Works great and incredibly stable. I used this on a sturdy wood dining room table, granite breakfast bar and a solid-surface snack bar. It held fast without budging and didn't leave any marks. This is great when visiting or going out to dinner, provided the table or counter can support the weight. I only wish it had a carrying case. My son finds it comfortable and after getting over the sight of him hanging off the side of something, I was very comfortable using it. I highly recommend it."
174103,1,"If it weren't for this swing, I think I'd never get a hot lunch. Our 4-week old gets fussy during the day and this swing calms him almost immediately. I've seen a lot of reviewers complain that even the slowest speed is too fast but I don't find that to be true at all. It does seem fast at first glance but I don't think the movement is any faster than the movement baby feels when I carry him and walk around the house. Our little guy has no problem with it and we've even gone up to the third speed when he's very fussy. Most often the swing puts him to sleep but sometimes he'll just sit in there and quietly look around. The nice wide seat gives him plenty of room to fling those little arms around, which he likes to do. I've also seen people complain that it drains batteries quickly so we've opted to use rechargeable batteries and that's working out fine. I love the muted colors of the swing--more often than not baby furniture sticks out like a sore thumb but not this swing. Our baby isn't old enough yet for us to use the toys and mobile much but I do have to say that although the swing's motor is very quiet, the mobile's motor is on the noisy side. But my only real complaint about this swing is that it's not portable. I would love to be able to move it between our living room and bedroom but it's legs are so wide it won't go through our doorways. Overall, I would highly recommend this swing though :)"
136472,0,"This dresser is exactly the look I wanted at the price I could afford, so I took a chance & ordered it despite mixed reviews online- though I am not unhappy with it- it is along the ""get what you pay for lines""- I would not say it ""exceeded"" any expectations- but it's what I expected for $200 and I'm satisfied overall. It was packaged well & we had no problems with its condition upon arrival as others have mentioned- it also arrived within about a week. If you have a bigger budget, I would suggest going for a better brand in hopes of a little better quality piece of furniture, if you are like us though and you simply can't spend more- this dresser will serve the purpose and it does LOOK very nice- it def. appears more expensive than it is. My husband put it together pretty easily with only minor ""glitches"" visible to us once it was done- the door on the front hangs just slightly crooked/doesn't latch perfectly because the pre-drilled holes for the hardware are slightly off & there are also some small (inconsistent) spaces in between the drawers that also probably shouldn't show... while these things are noticeable to us- it's highly unlikely anyone else would notice them unless they really inspected it. The drawers slide smoothly in & out and to me, there's plenty of space in them, which is a plus compared to some reviews I read prior to purchasing. Parts of the piece are particle board and you do feel like you have to be extra careful with certain parts during assembly- once all together though it does look & feel sturdy... All in all- it's not a 5 star product but I think we will get $200 worth of use out of it at the very least."
175497,0,".....If you don't mind drilling into the wall AND banister!!!!!!My husband did not want to ruin the banister so he zip tied a 2 x 4 to it and attached it to that. The gate works, it is a pain in the butt to open and more of a pain to close, but what do you really expect for the price?"
17219,1,"Had a safety 1st moinitor for three years until it accidently fell and broke, went shopping for new monitor and bought this model because of the cheaper price, and it is so much better than safety 1st. With the safety first model I was NEVER able to use the sound because of way too much static, but this model has EXCELLENT sound and picture. Thank you so much for the great product, and the cheaper price."
69823,1,"I like LUVS, When I first had my son a neighbor purchased to bags of it as a gift to start me out when I came home from the hospital. From then on I though it was pretty good but I had my mind stuck on one brand - pampers. But now that my boy is growing and getting bigger I need something that works just as good, and doesnt cost as much. I paid 28 dollars and some cents and for just about the same amount of pampers and paid 30-somethign dollars for the ''baby dry'' brand which did everything but keep my baby dry. LUVS proved top be very durable, and absorbant. It dont get stretched out of shampe like pampers do. So if you have a very active baby then LUVS will make you happier because it wont get saggy, and stretched out of shape due to babies movement. LUVS is definately the way to go and the price is much better. think of it this way - Why pay 30 to 35 dollars for the same amount of papmers that you would pay 29 dollars for the LUVS pampers which seals in the wetness just as good. Economise, and do it well....."

112472,1,"After toying with a few online and few in store options we figured that the Amazon deal works the best. Easy to order, and nothing to keep track of. Just order a few days before you think you will run out of diapers and that's it. As for the product itself, we had settled on Pampers after some initial trials. All we were looking for is price and shopping convenience. Getting this large box home delivered at no extra cost is what makes this deal good."
3729,0,"For me this bag really was the perfect size... not too big, not too small. It had compartments for everything I needed. Even had a removable zippered pouch. The only thing that I wish they would have done differently is the zipper into the bag. First it doesn't meet the material from end to end so when it's closed you have about an inch on each side that you can put your fingers in the bag. So when the bag is unzipped you have a terrible time getting things out of the bag since essentially the bag is wider than the zipper will open. I struggled to get the changing pad out and really struggled getting the cardboard packing out, finally had to try and fold it in half while still in the bag. I'm returning this bag as it really just won't function right with this current zipper. I'd also like to point out that it says the strap is adjustable... it isn't (that wasn't a problem but thought some folks might like to know)"
56415,1,"These are pretty effective. One side of my oven is exposed, and my son can reach up to the back wall of the stove and turn on the burners. He does occasionally fiddle with these knobs, as they fit loosely over the actual stove knobs, but fiddling with them does not ever turn on the burner; they just spin over the knob. There was one time that he yanked off the whole knob and safety cover, but really, if that happens, it is just a little metal prong sticking out and he still can't turn on the oven. I don't make a big fuss when he touches the covers, so he is really not too interested in them. I definitely feel like my kitchen is safer with these knob covers."
53053,1,"Our 5 month old daughter LOVES this. She squeals and laughs as she jumps around or if I ""swing"" her in it. (I hold her feet and swing her back and forth)It seems safe, but we have narrow doorways, so I sit right by her to prevent her from hitting her head on the doorframe. The biggest problem I have with it is that it's a pain to get her out..we have a jumperoo and an exersaucer and the doorway jumper is by far the most difficult when it comes to getting her out."

13319,0,Dispenser top was a bit too big - you're better off using the free one's from the pharmacy.
144033,1,"I bought this for my 25 lb 1 year old son. I typically carry him everywhere, but he's getting too big for me to do that. I have a travel system, but it takes up so much room in my car that I decided to get an umbrella for those quick trips, and days I just can't carry him.The Jeep umbrella handles great! I am very happy with it. I would have given it 5 stars except that the sun canopy is a joke -- they shouldn't even bother having one, since it just gets in the way and never protects my son from the sun.It also would be nice for even a small basket of some kind, but since this is an umbrella, I guess that's asking for too much.If you're looking for a great stroller for a trip to the mall, and one that is compact and lightweight for your car, this is a great option!"
148967,1,"As I was researching ways to make my wife feel better and accommodate her new lifestyle with a baby in her belly, I came across Back N Belly. I read the reviews and went on a bought one!I'm telling you, you shouldnt live without this! She thinks she will be using it even after she's pregnant because of the way it makes her sleep very comfortably.I only recommend that you tailor make a cover for the pillow as soon as you get it to avoid it getting dirty and trying to get the material out of the pillow which will be a bit of a hassle to fit back in."
178292,1,Great product. My wife and I wanted something a little fresher and hip than the backpack style of bag we had with our first. Plus my wife wanted more pockets. This did everything we wanted and more.

48398,2,We bought this monitor for our babies and were sorry we did. The sound & picture are of extremely poor quality and it even stopped working after a few months. We had to throw it away. This product is highly NOT recommended to monitor babies.
183291,0,"I'm so thankful that a friend gave me this bassinet, because if I had bought it I would have returned it. It was practically new when she gave it to me, she used it for 2 months, now my daughter is almost 3 months. As of now it's less then a year old and has only seen 5-6 months of use. At first I was pleased with the appearence, it is cute, but when it comes down to using it- it just has more cons then pros for me. When we first came home from the hospital I had a hard time bending over the edge to pick the baby up, it really hurt my back. I had a natural delivery, can't imagine how tough it would have been if I had a c-section. I never had back problems before pregnancy, and my baby was not posterior so I think my back pain was probably less then what a lot of mothers experience and it was still hard for me.You will soon realize... the cute little stuffed animal, star, and moon, all get in the way when taking baby in and out. So I removed them and haven't used them. They will bump your baby in the face which always startled her. It's just a pain, nomatter how careful you are, it's very hard to avoid them in the middle of the night.My main issue is the support, this bassinet does NOT lay completely flat. Take everyone's word for it... the bottom is made to fold and my baby ends up scrunched up in the middle with her face against the side. This is a big concern because they advertise it as having mesh sides, and it does... but only up towards the VERY top of the bassinet. My daughter has never ended up with her face against the mesh, she always winds up sunken into the middle with her face against the solid fabric. It has impacted my ability to sleep, which is getting better now that she is getting older, but in the beginning I was very worried and would have to straighten her out multiple times in the middle of the night.The storage underneath holds a decent amount of items. Don't try to get to them in the middle of the night if this bassinet is up against the side of your bed though. I keep big refills of wipes and diapers under there. It is not practical to use it for clothes in my opinion. I still have a basket of everything I use on my nightstand, and during the day I top off my supplys with what I keep under the bassinet.I've never used the changing table. I have no idea who is going to go through the hassel of removing the bassinet (unclipping it and placing it somewhere else) just to use the changing table. I buy ""chux"" pads and we change her on the bed.I, personally, would never bother carrying this bassinet with me through the house. With the bottom made to fold in half, it is not stable when you pick it up or set it down. (Think- like setting this down on your couch, but one of your cusions is higher then the other, the bassinet will give to this and it will move your baby.)When my friend gave this to me (which I am very apprecaitive of!), we wanted to give it a goo cleaning. What parent wouldn't? Well we tried to figure it our ourself and there is NO way to wash the fabric. It is sewn all around the frame. So we even took it to a dry cleaner and the owner told my Husband he couldn't clean it either. He said they are made as throw-aways, so you have to buy a new one with each baby. What a bunch of garbage, like you are supposed to spot clean poop if it were to get anywhere other then the removable cover on the cheap pad? The only thing I've spilled on it is coffee, and it doesn't look that bad because the color is similar.My Husband has a saying for products like this... He says so many things are made to do ""many things"" but they don't do any ONE thing very well.I'm nursing and need a better solution for our precious baby. She deserves better... She is almsot 3 months, is 11lbs 10oz, 23"" and doesn't have much room left in this bassinet. She likes to stretch and kick her legs. I want her in our room longer and don't want to move her full size crib into our tiny room. So I think I'm going to buy a mini crib and use that next to our bed instead. I wish I had just done that to begin with."
66984,0,"I agree that it's easy to install this gate. I bought the original, plus the 10-inch extension to fit the stairway on my deck (stop my toddlers falling down the 5 steps to the yard below).I'm sorry, I just don't see how this could be easy for anyone to open. I understand how the mechanism is supposed to work (pinch the little tabs together, and lift). I don't know whether my particular unit had a thicker-than-usual coat of paint that makes it all a lot stiffer to operate than it needs to be. I can definitely say that tabs you pinch with your fingers could be bigger.Overall, the whole thing is too stiff to operate with one hand. I'm keeping it because I typically only need to shut it while the kids are out on the deck, then leave it open the rest of the time, and it's hard to find an operable gate in this width (53"")."
29690,2,"When I registered for a diaper bag, I wanted something that my husband could feel comfortable carrying around. This was good for that reason, and that reason only! The shoulder strap attachment ripped off, the middle zipper pull fell apart so I had to use a safety pin to keep it on, and I found the attached changing pad annoying. I never used it. I packed a portable one in the side pocket. By the time my son was 2 months old, the pad was too small and he didn't fit on it. Plus, it was difficult to position and use. I would definitely NOT suggest purchasing this product."
96444,2,"I bought this thinking that you do not have to screw anything or stick anything onto your doors. I was wrong. Who wants to put screw holes into their doors? And, who would want to risk puting up adhesive and then tearing it off when you are finished with it? If you don't care about these things, then this is probably a great lock. But, I care about the appearance of my doors that will be seen long after I don't need these locks anymore! -My quest continues for a lever lock...!"

106593,0,"We've bought three Diaper Champs. The first two worked great (one for upstairs, one for down), until we moved. Somehow during the shipping process, one began to stink, although we had thoroughly cleaned and sanitized it with bleach. By the time we unpacked it, it was horrible. We immediately logged on, and bought another from Amazon, and it doesn't work any better than a plain old garbage pail. We are finally considering a diaper genie! I hope we just happen to be unlucky with this product and you will have better luck!"
155232,1,"I've had this gate for a couple of years now, and it works ok. I'm a little taller and can step over the gate with no problems. My daughter (5 year old) can climb over the gate and get out fine (our bathroom is on the other side of the gate). It holds securely and I have never had it fall over with my 17 mo old son pushing on it. I can't find anywhere that it will pinch my children at all and after I got the hang of it, it's easy to put up and take down. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is due to it has taken off the paint in the two places I have hung it in my house. The rubber stops that hold it against the wall are too sticky or something. I'm not talking just smudging the paint, it has literally ripped chunks of paint off my wall about an inch in diameter (the same size as the rubber stops.) I will need to repaint my hallway and doorway after I stop using it."
24271,1,"I purchased three sheets to go with our co-sleeper. So far, we have washed all of them a few times, and even accidentally dried one. The one that went through the drier continues to fit just fine. They take quite a while to air dry, so I might toss them in the drier occasionally at the end to soften and finish them off in the future.I really like that the sheets fit so tightly to the mattress. I have not had any difficulty getting them on and adjusted properly. I think three sets is perfect and hope they will last for a long time."

118818,2,"I thought I had adequately done my research when I ordered this seat. It got rave reviews from both individuals and in safety testers. I was especially looking for one that had head support, and this one was described as having a deep head rest. However, I was disappointed when I finally used it. The first and only day I used it, my family had a long drive home from grandma's one night and the kids fell asleep. I turned around and found my son slumped over and falling out of the seat. He had his seat belt on and was originally upright, but the head rest and sides of the seat were not enough to support him. I kept trying to prop him back up, but there simply wasn't enough support in the seat. I immediately removed the seat and returned it. I've since ordered another seat by Sunshine Kids. It was the closest thing I could find to the Britax Parkway, which my older son has. Apparently, Britax stopped making that seat, so I tried to find something comparable w/o having to pay hundreds of dollars. The seat I bought by Sunshine is available on Amazon as well. The Sunshine seat has side panels that stick out farther (deeper) and a head rest which is more narrow and cradles the head, should the child fall asleep. It does cost more than this one, but it's worth it to me."
147859,1,"I only found couple reviews on this product but I thought I'd risk it and order it. It was bit tricky at first to assemble, but after the first couple times it's so easy. I think it's awesome. I throw this in my purse in a quart size ziploc bag and carry a bottle with a lid to store for when I'm out and need to express myself or when I'm traveling. It's so much easier than carry my double electric pump and looking for a place to plug in and hookup. I never used the flexi shield and it works fine for me that way. I feel that the hand pump has stronger suction than my Ameda Purely Yours electric pump!It's great to put it in your purse or to use when you can't be hooked on to the pumps. I would totally recommend this product and I have!!"
17360,1,"I used to have to go to the Med Clinic near me and get a prescription for Lotrisone for butt-fungus several times a year. I have not had to go to the clinic once after starting to use this product. These actually clean as you wipe, and they apparently do much better than plain dry paper. They are individually wrapped and easy to carry in your pocket or purse. It's a great product."

131813,2,"How many problems do I need to have? Sure I wanted the Britax it looks good and it is THE car seat to have.The tether is sooo hard to adjust and has been they dont care and then all the sudden i get a recall notice in the mail....for the exact problem.Then the top clips just wont clip anymore?????????After 40 MINUTES waiting they tell me that makes no difference in the safety and some people actually take it off? Was she serious. I told her ""Ma'am I highly doubt there are many parents out there TAKING off clips from their car seat."" Whatever the clip is being sent UPS ground it will be here in 7-10 days...until then she assured me it was safe. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever. I purchased a double jogger 2 years ago and it has had a few problems...brand new one fedexed out to me but a problem with a car seat? I won't be buying anymore Britax items and I suggest nobody else does either."
97188,1,"This is the one thing our 4 year old daughter wanted for Christmas this year. I hesitated to get it for her thinking it might be too babyish and because it receives mixed reviews. So far she loves it. We had no problem getting the sound box into the giraffe but the again I was prepared for it to be very difficult. The animal is soft and snuggly. She sleeps with it every night. It has been a nice alternative to listening to relaxing white noise music on her CD player. The thing that bothers me is you can clearly hear how the sounds ""cycle"" on each ""track"" although the sounds will play for 45 minutes it is about a 15 sec (or less) sound bit that cycles over and over. I find it annoying to hear the giraffe grunt every 15 seconds but our daughter hasn't picked up on it or at least it doesn't bother her."
133361,1,"we bought the born free bottles because i was hesitant to buy the bottles with bisphenyl-A, and my baby took the bottle without a problem, so i've been very satisfied with them. i have the various size nipples, and my daughter was about 2 mo behind what they suggested for the ages for each nipple, i guess she just likes the slower flow, but otherwise it's good to have the option for varied nipple flow. i don't really have anything to compare them to, since these are all we've used, but i can't complain."
82644,1,"My husband and I are VERY happy with this sheep. The size is perfect for the crib and to travel with (I wouldn't want the bigger size). The sounds are all very soothing. Our child likes the stream and rain sounds best....probably because they are constant. The whale and waves are nice too, though if your baby wakes easily the crashing of the waves or the sudden whale song may wake him or her up, otherwise they are pleasant.The sound has two timer settings, one for 45 min and one or 23 min(the bigger size only has 23 min). We use the 45 min setting most of the time and find that it is more than enough time to help our little one settle and fall asleep. Others complain that the sound doesn't stay on all night, but that's not what this product is created for, so if that's what you want I suggest you look elsewhere.Not only does our daughter love the sounds the sheep makes, but she also enjoys talking to it and batting at it in the morning when she first wakes up. The Velcro is VERY strong so I have never been worried about it falling into the crib.We got this sheep just before my daughter was born and after 6 months of daily use the sound became severely distorted. I sent an e-mail to Cloud b consumer service letting them know about this problem and within 24 hrs I got an e-mail back saying they were shipping me a new sound box. I got the box in the mail a few days later. Other than the issue with the sound box (which was fixed very quickly) I have loved this sheep and would recommend it to any parent!"
136750,2,"I thought that since I was buying a Leap Frog item that I would be happy, boy was I wrong! My son sleeps on his tummy, so that could be a reason for my displeasure of the toy; but the main things that I don't like it is the knob to turn the toy on, and also the overall size of it. It's so bulky that if my son moves to close to the bumper he could hurt his head. It's defintely a battery drainer! And the sound doesn't go up high enough. I was going to buy the fisher price aquarium sounds but instead I went with the dreamscapes soother, BIG MISTAKE!"

If you only need to take the bare minimum then it's fine otherwise go for something bigger!"
124475,1,"When I first received the Buggy Bagg, I was impressed. The entire seat area was cushioned with thick, comfortable, futon-like padding and it seemed very easy to assemble in a shopping cart or a restaurant high-chair. What seemed like a joke to me was that it came with a detachable pillow for a child to lean against and fall asleep on in the cart. Ha, what child would ever fall asleep while shopping. Well, jokes on me because the very first time using the Buggy Bagg, my one year old daughter fell asleep while I drove to the market and even though I had to disrupt her by taking her out of the carseat and putting her into the shopping cart, she snuggled on to the pillow and continued to sleep the entire time I shopped. She looked so comfortable and content, everyone in the market commented how cute she was. This Buggy Bagg is a definite winner!!!"
88364,0,"I like the kit, but it does not get 5 stars b/c the thermometer never worked and the aspirator is not as big as it should so it takes more effort to get the job done, and it's annoying."

35434,1,"i definitely recommend this highchair. it's so easy to get them in and out! not to mention that the wheels makes it easy to move all around the kitchen. the only thing, the pneumatic device stopped working on mine after only a couple months. i have to call their customer service to have them replace the part."
88915,0,"I was excited about the subscribe and save program because I could get pampers for roughly the same price as I had been buying Luvs from Walmart. After going through my first pack that I bought through subscribe and save, I'm switching to Luvs through subscribe and save which is substantially cheaper! Here are the pros and cons of pampers baby dry diapers:Pros:1-You can't smell pee even when the diaper is very full. This is nice.2-They're mostly white without much obnoxious color or pictures.3-They are very flat and small and compact.Cons:1-You might not be able to smell when they've peed a lot, but they start to wick pretty badly. They start to feel pretty wet to the touch. GROSS! I'd rather be able to smell it than pick up my baby and start to feel dampness through their diaper!2-the leakguards on the sides of diapers are sort of pathetic.For me the grossness factor of the cons definitely outweighed the convenience factor of the pros."
61638,1,We bought this monitor after we moved out of our dinky 1 bedroom apartment into a 2 bedroom. We got a monitor at our baby shower that was from a second hand store and older than dirt and covered in dirt and scratches. We used it one nite and that was it I had it with all the static so I bought this one the next day. My main influence was price. This monitor is so sensitive that I can hear my daughter snore. I can also hear the conversations of the people upstairs if I turn the reciever up loud enough. I have had no problems with static and I love that you can either plug it in or have it stand alone. The belt clip feature is great too.

110197,1,"For three months, i was using the 2-piece personal fit breast shields that came with the pump and just washed & sterilize them with the medela steam bag after every use. When I went back to work, I purchased 4 of these and my only regret is that I didnt purchase them sooner! I work 12 hr shifts and pump every 4-6hrs. I've been using them for 3 months now and it is so helpful to have spare parts when I'm on the go. They hold great suction (better than the 2-piece personal fit ones) and are easy to clean. I'm thinking of buying a few more and I would definately recommend these to anyone who pumps regularly."
59751,1,"This is a great bathtub. We received the Four Stage Bath System (The First Years) as a shower gift. I always needed help bathing my son because this tub did not support him well enough and he quickly outgrew it. He is six months old, but doesn't sit up unassissted yet. The EuroBath supports him wonderfully, while still allowing him to be in the water enough to play. He absolutely loves his bath now! I really wish we would have had this tub from the very beginning. And when he can sit up unassissted, we simply let him sit on the other side of the tub and there is still a support so he can't slip under the water. I highly recommend this tub!"
139486,2,"Lady Bug worked beautifully...for one night. Changed the batteries, followed directions, no results. If I didn't have a sleep-hating baby, I'd probably have the wherewithal to return this thing. It's impossible to change the lightbulb (or even get to it, just to see if there's a loose/dirty connection). I like being able to fix things without disemboweling them!"
152661,1,"A year ago I bought a six-pack of these and used every single one (some of them up to three times each, thanks to the super-absorbency) by the end of our two-week vacation. Our son was potty-trained for only a few months, and we were concerned about him not being able to ""hold it"" while we searched for restrooms in unfamiliar places or while we were stuck on the plane. Well, we used this in lines at Disneyland (wrapped a jacket around his waist and stored it in a drawstring, waterproof ""wet bag"") and even on the plane (no one knew!). The odor really is eliminated in most cases, unless it's super hot out. I've even used it over the span of a couple of days with no leakage or odor problems. Now, we are sure to keep at least one of these in the car for when we have to pull over on the side of the road for a quick pee break. Great product!"

156222,0,"My son had a love hate relationship with this swing. It depended on the month and time of day, I guess. Sometimes, it was a great way to get him to fall asleep or a quick place to secure him when I needed two hands free. It was used moderately--not $100+ worth.I enjoyed the classical music, but the other sounds were more like white noise than their description. The adults could not tolerate them.The mobile has nothing for a child. From the child's view is just the underside of turtles (a circle with nubs) in hard to distinguish pastel colors. In fact, my son stared at the bright warning label on the inside of the stand longer in one sitting than he ever looked at the mobile over the lifetime of the swing.I HATED the tray. It was a useless obstacle in reaching my non-mobile infant (the harness seemed more than sufficient for safety). By the time my child was old enough to use the tray, he didn't use the swing.Overall, the swing worked as it should and we didn't have issues with its operation. The timer was a nice feature that we rarely used. It always remained in its lowest position, despite having other more upright settings."
31076,1,"I bought a used Joovy Caboose Original then sold it and bought the Ultralight. I had a newborn and 19 month old (who is petite) and wanted something that I could use with the infant car seat. The Ultralight is Definitely worth the extra money. The lighter design makes it MUCH easier to steer. The canopy is better, they fixed the brake design so you can wheel it while it is folded up. The jump seat does not slide around as much and it is a smoother ride. I had people remark that they didn't realize it was a double stroller and were surprised to see two kids in it. You'll have to view the photos to see how I fit the car seat in the rear.I put my graco snugride in the back and love using it this way so my toddler can sit in front and see everything. The car seat can tilt slightly forward, so I always have her harnessed in. It takes a bit of a manuever to fit it in, but once it's there, it's not going anywhere. It will only last as long as her legs don't reach longer than the end of the car seat because then she will be kicking the seat in front of her. I always manage to take both the tray and the car seat cradle/adapter with me by tucking one of them under the car seat, that way I can always flip the configuration depending on if my toddler needs to sit and snack or wants to stand. I even attach a stroller cooler/caddy for food since the basket below is used for changing kits, jackets, baby bjorn, etc. (stuff you can easily pull out from the sides). Be creative, it's pretty versatile and great for day trips out. Also, with the car seat in the rear, the front seat won't recline, but my toddler has fallen asleep before and I just use a blanket, jacket, changing pad or whatever I have to support his head on the side and he is fine for a little while until we get to the car or get home, though it is not ideal if you will be out when the older one needs to take a long nap.There are many words of caution to consider when buying this stroller. How much does your toddler want to sit vs. stand or walk. How well does he listen about staying on. Do you do many day trips to zoo, where you walk is there a lot of traffic, etc. This stroller is pretty versatile and as your kids grow and change I think you can make it work, but I don't know if I would get it to be my only stroller. I do like having it as an option in addition to the frame stroller. My son is now 27 months and almost always wants to walk so it's hard to get him to sit in a stroller at all.I think if you only want one stroller and can spend the money ($500-$600), get the bob duallie revolution or the phil & ted E3 with doubles kit. Personally, for the same money, I'd rather have a $225 Maclaren twin triumph, a $229 Joovy Caboose UL, and a used $200 Dreamer Design fixed bicycle wheels jogging stroller. And I still use my frame stroller (free hand-me-down), my single Maclaren (used $100), my single jeep 3 wheeler (new $80), single Peg Venezia (used $100). Unfortunately, I don't think one stroller is the answer and I have room in my garage to park them all. Maybe I should sell them all and get the bob duallie revolution after all, I just might, it's crazy, but I'm expecting baby #3 who will be 15 months younger. So I have to decide, if you have 3 babies in 3 yrs is it better to simplify or have options... Update: I just looked at the bob duallie and it is too big and heavy, so I've sold 2 of my strollers so far and will get the Phil & Teds with double seat (2007 model on sale now with free double seat because they will be rolling out the new 2008 models with improved braking, canopy, etc. google the Phil and Teds Vibe and you'll see)."
129677,2,"I was given the Medela nipple shield in the hospital, but after a few weeks of use I was scared that I might lose or damage it and be unable to breastfeed my baby. I went to the store to buy a back up nipple shield. I bought the AVENT nipple shield because I got 2 for the price of 1 Medela one.I love my Medela nipple shield much better! Here are the differences:1) AVENT is much stiffer2) AVENT hurts to put on (not horribly bad)3) AVENT does not stay on as wellI still have the AVENT in my diaper bag incase of an emergency, but I would rather not use it. I am still using my Medela nipple shield (3 months strong!)"
27519,1,"I was looking for a bassinet sheet that would fit my kolcraft easy reach bassinet, which has an oval mattress. I am extremely pleased with this sheet. It is very soft, the material is a good quality, and it fits. I've had other sheets that were skimpy and pulled the mattress up. I think this sheet wold work for a variety of bassinets. I'm thinking of getting another one."
16222,1,"I absolutely love this blanket! Here are some of the reasons why. It is:- Large enough to fit my 6'2'' husband, 3 year old son, and me.- Waterproof, sandproof and stainproof. Perfect for a picnic, at the beach or with kids who tend to spill stuff.- Comfortable because there is a cushion pad which makes it bearable to sit on the ground for long periods of time.- Portable since it folds up and you can carry it around with the shoulder strap. There is also a little pocket to store slim items in.- Works very well as a play mat for babies and toddlers.- Beautiful. I love the patterns and the colors. It isn't frumpy looking like other picnic blankets I've seen.I highly recommend this blanket over all others!"
4679,1,I have tried every brand of diapers out there - including other non-chlorine diapers. And these are by far the best. We almost never have problems with leaking and they don't have the foul smell that Pampers and Huggies have. I would highly recommend these to everyone.
165844,2,Left my baby with a diaper rash after 2 days of use. I didn't suspect it was from the diapers at first until a couple weeks later I went to finish using up the package and her rash appeared again. I'll never use pampers again.
172420,2,"I AGREE WITH ONE OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS. THE OLDER VERSION OF THIS PRODUCT (BLUE SWIVEL SEAT) IS BY FAR BETTER. THIS SEAT DOES NOT FIT ON MY TUB BECAUSE OF THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR TRACK. IT IS BIG AND CLUMSY. I HAVE TO FIND SPACE TO STORE IT WHEN I WANT TO BATHE MY OTHER CHILDREN. IT IS JUST IN THE WAY. THERE IS NO SUCTION ON THE BOTTOM....IT TIPS OVER. THE IDEA IS GOOD, BUT IT DOESN'T DO THE TRICK."
90222,1,"I like this diaper because it doesn't smell chemically like some other brands I've tried but has a nice baby powder scent. The only reason I marked it four stars is because its supposed to be a 12 hour diaper (not that I would ever leave it on that long), but sometimes my baby wakes up with her clothes smelling like pee because it leaked during the night when she was sleeping. During the day I don't have this issue because I change her alot more often."
150093,2,It is ok but it isn't very useful and it takes a bit of work to put it on the seat everytime you use it. I am worried that she will get car sick if she uses it on long trips and I am a little worried about the safety with it attached on her if she was in a accident. I guess it is better than something hard being in front of her but I doubt it has been tested to be safe or not. It is flimsy too. I don't think it will hold up for long and find that it just ends up on the floor being trampled on.
49137,0,"I had the metal gates with a fitted padding inside at first. I wanted a gate that came with its own padding but I sent it back because the poles kept falling out! I decided to buy my own pads and get a plastic gate. I got this one and the extensions but they were very hard to fold into shape. I tried straightening it and putting the extenders on and I broke them. The plastics just snapped. As soon as I took the broken pieces off and taped it, I tried folding it back into a shape to make a coral for the babies toys, I cracked it again. I decided to stop trying to shape it and leave it the way it is all lopsided. It cracks and it is flimsy. My 1 yr old can stick her hands under it on carpet or hard floors. It does the job, but don't expect to resell it later on cause it probably won't last."
115425,0,"My son wanted a Thomas potty and this was a good choice for him. He loves the trains on the seat. However, the hole is not big enough. We have a difficult time getting my son positioned on the potty so that he can go without getting urine on the seat. And the cusion is not easy to keep clean because urine gets trapped underneath it and in the sides."
106312,0,"I bought the diaper champ when I was expecting my first child because I did not like the idea of having to buy refills and liked the one-handed operation. This is very helpful when holding a baby. It worked well for the first few months. I sanitized it with Lysol at every bag change (about once every 3 days) and cleaned it inside and out every 2 weeks. Then, when my daughter was about 5 months old, I started noticing the smell in her room. I tried soaking in bleach and more, but could not get the smell out. I realized that it was just getting worn - plastic rubbing down and allowing fumes to escape. The smell was not overwhelming, but not acceptable to me for my house. So, I moved it to just outside our back door. We still use it every day (she is now 10 months), it is just outside. It does not smell as you walk by since it is outdoors - not a closed bedroom. It worked well while she was young and needed changed in the middle of the night, etc. Now it is ok outside - still like the one-handed operation and no bags. Hopefully, they make some improvements before we have our next child."
164624,0,"The amount for the price had me sold... however, I used Huggies prior to this and will be returning to them. Pampers just don't hold as much as Huggies. Big #2's leak out of the diaper and it just makes a huge mess neither my little one nor me wants to deal with. Also I noticed more redness on the skin along the thighs from the diaper rubbing against the skin. She's wearing the right size, anything larger would be too loose... I just wasn't fully satisified with the product."
59684,1,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this tub. I started using it when my son was a few weeks old, and at 10 mos. we are still using it everyday. He loves it! We use it in the reclining position to make washing his hair easier, then he sits and plays on the other side. The tub is large enough to have plenty of water for splashing. Only one minor drawback, it's size doesn't make it easily portable, if you need to travel. So, when visiting his grandparents, I tried to use other products, including inflatable tubs, tub seats, and the good old kitchen sink...none were as safe or as comfortable as the Euro tub, and my son didn't like any of them...so I came back to this site to buy another one to leave at grandma's house...that solved the problem!! Well worth every penny! It's 2008 and I'm now using it for child #2! Still great!"
85350,1,"This pillow works great, but I really didn't anticipate the size. I love the fact that it's big enough that I don't have to move the pillow every time I change sides. The head part of this pillow is a little flat for me so I use a regular pillow on top. As I stated before, the size was a little larger than anticipated. We have a king size bed and my husband says he feels like he's in outer Siberia when I use the pillow."
34528,1,You don't need to buy special bags for this. It's easy to use and keeps the smell in. Of course you need to change it regulary. I love this diaper pail!
160007,1,This was also ordered on suggestion from the yahoo answers site when I was looking for a baby tub. This is very good although I haven't gotten as much use out of it as the baby foam. This works well in the bath if the bath is very shallow. It does not work in the sink as it is too big for most sinks. Overall the quality is good and I suggest this and the green baby bath foam --you could prop this on top of the foam. Our baby has only used this a couple of time but it is fairly practical and since it is mesh it dries quickly.
164946,1,"These have worked very well for my daughter, for the most part these keep her dry. When I have had trouble is on occasion she will be a little wet in the mornings, though I must take into account that this means going w/ the 1 diaper from 7p-7a w/o changing. They do claim to keep baby dry for 12-13 hrs though. I take very meticulous care to place the diaper very well, so that there are the least chances of any leakage too. Despite these occasional accidents, I am having another baby soon & will likely be using Pampers as my choice of diaper."
168538,1,We love the pampers swaddlers there nice and soft. Our favorite feature is the line that lets you know when it's time to change them! My husband loves that line! Most importantly they can hold up. I've never had leak out or poop out! I just wish they made them in sizes 4 and 5!
41828,1,Awesome product! I have never seen or tried anything like it for preventing diaper rash. Works better than anything else at keeping my baby dry.
117901,2,"We used avent, Playtex Ventaire adn Dr. Brown's with our daughter. This rack didn't work with any of them! The Ventaires didn't fit well on dryer adn would wiggle all around and fall off if it was jiggled in the least. It did hold all of the Ventaire part well which that would be the only plus for this item.The wide neck bottles fit better in the dryer but still didn't fit well. But then the collars and nipples were really too big to work with this rack. The Dr. Brown's were even worse becasue of the inside pieces.We never really were able to get stable enough to use in the folded position and we were never able to get anyting to hang on the hooks without falling either. We also had to buy 4 of these toeven find one that wasn't broken when we took it out of the box. The first two were broken and the basket wouldn't hook on and the third one was broken and could not bend in the middle. This rack leaves alot to be desired to say the least."
67951,0,"Received this as a gift. Its best feature is that it folds up into a compact size and can be easily stowed (hence the word travel in the name). The downside of this is that the bar isn't very sturdy, and frequently falls to the floor in front of or behind the baby. The toys are good though, the ears make crinkly noises when squeezed, so it provides a good amount of fun & stimulation -- just know you'll have to put the bar back up every few minutes."
110528,2,"I bought these to keep my toddler out of my IKEA HEMNES television stand drawers. The design of these drawers is straightforward and their surfaces are totally flat so I thought these locks would work perfectly. I was wrong. First of all, the instructions are ambiguous. Secondly, the stick-on template is useless. I followed the instructions to the letter on my first drawer and once the lock was installed, it wasn't effective and my drawer wouldn't close all the way. My toddler pulled it right open. After that, I made my own measurements and placed the lock and catch where I thought they would work. Through trial and error, I eventually found the placement where my drawer would close and the lock would catch (and, yes, I ended up drilling way too many holes in my drawer,) but the it was still easily opened without the key. Then I turned the catch around; I screwed it in opposite the direction shown in the instructions. I used what I'd learned from that first drawer on the other two and now my TV stand is child proof...no thanks to Safety 1st. If you decide to buy these, I would reccomend that you experiment with the placement using tape before you make any holes. That said, I really don't think it's worth the trouble. Yes, these locks are invisible from the outside, but an easier, less painful option would be better for your well being and life in general [read: don't buy this if you have high blood pressure!]"
143691,0,"I had to ""fix"" my stroller, the instep suburban swivel... with some WD40 for the wheel, Then I cut a hole in the top so I could have a viewer, then I added a snuggli so it'd be more padded, then I added a tether, then I added reflective tape. Then of course, I had to add this sunshade. It's cumbersome and I wish it would collapse somehow into the visor. I haven't even used it yet, figuring with winter coming the sun won't burn my baby and vitamin E is good for her. :-) But I'm sure, come summer time this will be a MUST HAVE in the car and on a jog.. I'm just dreading the wind."
167686,0,"While we thought the furniture was beautiful, when it was unpacked in our nursery, we soon realized it smelled of almost a chemical/varnish stench. We spoke to Babies R Us who referred us to Simmonds. The company admitted that they sometimes package the product prior to it being fully dried and suggested that we use Pledge and/or a mixture of vinegar/water every day for several weeks. We thought that was a bit out of the ordinary for brand new furniture of this price range and asked that they reorder another set. In total 3 weeks had past and we went ahead and Pledged the heck out of it and by the time the new furniture arrived, the stench was gone---but it took 3 weeks! Something to be aware of!!!!!!!!!!!!"
122325,0,"I like the product and find it useful, but it has a few strange quirks. Like the lid doesn't fix on and you have to hold it there with your hand to start the motor. A bit weird! It is also very loud when switched on!"
88121,1,"We live in Germany (no Babies R Us) and received this as a gift. It is incredible. We began laying our baby on this mat at 1 month old and he was completely stimulated by the bold colors. He is now 2 months and is so happy when he plays and just giggles non stop. He especially loves boxing octopus and listening to the lullaby of the sea horse. He cracks up at his reflection on the turtle mirror! There are so many places to hook up additional toys, such as a monkey, elephant, whale, etc. An absolutely ""wunderbar"" toy for all babies!"
169567,1,"This bag is awesome! It can carry a bunch of baby crap and is comfortable to wear. The only thing I can complain about is the cell phone holder located on the strap, it will not hold a modern mobile phone. It might hold a Nokia, an Ericsson, or even the first generation iPhone, but it will not hold a modern-day mobile phone, e.g., Samsung Galaxy SIII or iPhone 5. Other than that minor flaw, it's a great bag!!!"
108791,1,This shampoo is like magic!!! My baby had a little bit of cradles cap and I used this and kaboom - cradles cap gone!! It smells great as well!! Try it you won't regret it!! It works!
62046,1,"I love these! My daughter has always worn Huggies; and I loved them. As we were potty training I bought pull ups they looked ok; but they gave her a bit of a rash. The easy ups are softer and they do not leak at night! My daughter would wear a nighttime pull up and leak! I would have to change her clothes and her pull up almost every night. These last all night, leave no rash and she doesn't wake up from leaking! Fantastic product! Even during the day she knows if she goes pee in them; wonderful design! These do tend to run small so if you look at the weight on the box and your child could go either way get the bigger size."
167972,1,This is a very comfortable sleeping pillow that provides snug support throughout the night. Its nice not having to adjust through the night 3 or 4 pillows around myself to remain comfortable. I only wish the portion that fits through your legs was thicker/fluffier. I still need to use another pillow in between my legs so my hips aren't sore in the morning.
168850,0,"Arrived at my door much faster than the estimated ship date and all seemed good till I discovered that even though the box was labeled size 1, the box contained about 1/3 size 1's, and 2/3 size 1-2's which are a little bigger (for 10-15 lbs). Other than that, swaddlers's work well, and the wetness indicator is a great feature."
26085,2,"We have been using both the infant seat and it's matching stroller now for three months and I am anxiously awaiting my 3-month old son to outgrow it! The only positive thing I can say about this carseat is that is is definitely SAFE. However, it is much heavier than other brands and because of it's super-thick padding, it is hard to get my 15-pound son in and out of it. He's 25 inches long and just about reaches the edge of the seat. This carseat is also VERY heavy, and more importantly it does NOT have any fabric or anything on the handle with which to hold on. This makes it necessary to hold the carrier in the crease of your arm. I do NOT recommend this carrier. The stroller is also not one I would recommend. It is very compact, which is its only positive attribute, but it is difficult to snap-in the infant carrier to it. I will NOT be using our Peg carrier nor stroller with baby #2."
146699,1,Got this for my 3.5mth old son who loves to 'push off' things. We have had it for a few weeks now and he absolutely loves it! Has 3 adjustable heights to grow with the babies. Not too bad to put together either!
96122,1,"This bag has more than enough room for all the baby essentials. Sturdy construction, slim profile, and comes with a small changing pad."
181709,1,"I bought this cart to store my baby's stuff in our bedroom because we have a 1st floor master, and she slept in our room for the first 3 months. It was so convenient to have her clothes and diapers downstairs. Although she is now sleeping in her crib upstairs, we are continuing to use it as sometimes it's just easier to change her downstairs. My husband put it together without any problems and even when it's completely filled with stuff, it has held up well."
68009,2,"The bag fit my maclaren stroller perfectly. It did protect it on the plane it was filthy when we got it back. Unfortunately one of the seams ripped, I feel that happened pretty quick. But I am glad all the dirt and oil is not on my stroller."
7659,0,"This monitor was pretty good for the first year. It came with a cord for each unit which was nice to have. We kept one parent unit plugged in next to our bed and kept the other mobile, so the extra cord was nice to have on trips for the base instead of unplugging the base's cord.However, then it started doing this buzzing static sound. I fiddled with it for awhile by switching cords, switching locations, and other stuff and that seemed to help until I wanted to take it somewhere. Now it is doing it again. I'm going to find a new one to replace this, which is a shame because when it works well it has great distance and clarity."
2409,2,In general I like Pampers items and quality. But the Baby Dry version I seem to have a lot of leaks.
75424,1,"Sunshine Kids Change 'n GoCompact and convenient. Carries wipes, cream, diapers and even keys. Appeals to dads because it isn't ""frou frou."" This is now my new mother baby gift for all my friends."
25245,2,Product is not worth the money. Made the bassinet very unstable.
1982,1,"I really think pampers baby dry are really good and so are huggies, but you know what? I am sticking with the pampers baby dry because you get more diapers and its really the same as Huggies.I am a mother of my fourth child now and believe me I even made mistakes putting on the diaper on my newborn son as well because its been awhile.I find if you change the baby as often as you should and put them on correctly you will find really no different beside the bulkyness of huggies.I like the fact that Pampers baby dry sells larger cases of diapers, I don't run out as quickly.I would stay away from store brand diapers all together because there not made well."
142040,1,"I prefer this mesh feeder to the Munchkin brand. This one is larger and easier to clean. I don't really like to put food in it. I freeze unsweetened applesauce in a ice cube tray, then pop one into the mesh. My son loves them, especially when he is teething."
111285,1,Love the nursing cover! The design is very nice and I love the inside cloth at the edges which can be used as a burp cloth or to insert my baby's pacifier. My daughter loves the design too. Sometimes she stops feeding to play with the nursing cover which I think is cute. She didn't do this with my other nursing cover which was just solid black inside.
129251,0,"We got this for my baby at around 6 months, and she has showed no interest in this. She is about 7.5 months now and still has no interest. As everyone knows, every baby is different."
39466,1,My little one sleeps great in these and they keep him the perfect temperature in the fall/winter. I plan on keeping him in these as long as possible!
70692,1,"We are happy with this purchase. The chair was not difficult to assemble and seems like it will be a nice piece to have as our baby boy grows up. Because it is a toddler rocker, it is a bit wide, so our son ends up tilting a bit to the side since he isn't wide enough for the chair yet and isn't quite strong enough to sit straight on his own. The recline and upright angles aren't very different from each other, but they work just fine."
111217,0,"the cover is too bulky, so to say. too much material, and it does not cover the sides, just the front. it is also very hot to use in summer, my baby would get really sweaty under this cover. the ring that goes around your neck is not ""hard"" enough and does not stay open for you to see the baby as you nurse. it keeps falling in"
184103,1,"juts like it look in the picture, is the size i needed and it look beautiful in my son bedroom"
129904,2,This was not the base that went with my car seat even though this product was linked with the car seat.
156288,1,"This product is well made and offers a way to walk around in a sleepy sack. My son may be too young to figure it out yet, but at night he puts his feet out and in the morning his feet or legs are cold. Not sure if he just doesn't know he can put it back in or if it doesn't bother him. Either way, we just use socks. I wish they had this in cotton too."
139090,1,I have a 4 yr old who adores this item. he can turn it on if he wakes up during the night for comfort. It also shuts itself off in 30 minutes. I recently gave this as a gift to a 3 yr old and he would not put it down. It makes him look forward to bedtime. I would gladly recommend this to anyone.
13475,1,This is a great product and solved the powerstrip problem that I had in my daughter's room. It was a perfect fit for my powerstrip which was just a standard size (not one of those supersized double wide ones).
119737,0,my son doesn't seem comfortable when sitting in this tub. however it is good quality and you can line the bottom with a bath towel.
86768,1,Wonderful invention! I wish we had them when my kids were little. My daughter in law loves it. Perfect for the mall shopping.
38298,1,"I like this gate overall, it took me 3 months to actually pick one that was wide enough, and this was great. The only things that were hard to figure out was; the handle (how to get to the perfect spot), and that when you tighten the plugs on the sides, they screw in opposite directions on each side. When I finally got it installed, I was very happy."
171089,0,"Product is basic, colors of cover okay but brighter would be better; a good number of pages but they are plastic and wrinkled making the final product okay but lacking."
82767,0,My baby falls a sleep well with the heart beat sound so when I saw the lamb with the heart beat sound I was excited. Then I noticed that there was a travel size lamb. It did not list the sounds so foolishly I presumed that it had the same sounds since both showed 4 sound options. It does not!!!!! This item does not have the Heart Beat Sound! The Item works great and looks just like the picture. It arrived before estimated date which was great but really wish the sounds would have been listed.
105779,1,"I had tried a Diaper Genie at a friend's house and wasn't really impressed with how it worked, not to mention the idea of having to buy refills. I registered for the Diaper Champ primarily because you could use regular kitchen trash bags instead of special refills, and all the good reviews it seemed to get. I could not be happier with the Champ! It is truly the easiet thing in the world to use--one hand is all you need. We have not noticed an odor problem at all. Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone having a baby! It is by far the best thing I received as a shower gift. You won't be disappointed in the Champ!"
16271,0,"the quality is very good, so i give 5 starts for quality. but, i have to give 3 stars for the size.now that i'm really thinking about it, a picnic blanket must be minimum of 6 ft so you can lie down without your feet going over. (assuming you are not taller than 6 ft)having said that, they clearly say it's 5x5 ft so it's my fault for not thinking this through. maybe they can make a 6 x 6 size?"
2572,1,"I finally found a diaper that works! Love, love, love these diapers...I'm so happy with them and no longer have to search for a diaper that works."
112386,0,"I used to buy swaddlers and liked them. But when it is time to switch I tried cruisers on my baby, and I did not like them with the quality."
27094,1,I could not have lived without this product. I have worn it everyday since I started showing at about 18 weeks. It really supports your belly when your walking and when you go to stand up. It helps 100% with holding the belly weight up while standing and walking. I highly recommend this over any other product. Fits easily and easy to hide under shirts. I wear tank tops under the cradle because it is not comfortable directly on the skin with the rubbing of pants. It could also go on top of the panel of maternity pants. I purchased the size small and I was worried it would be too small. But I was somewhat overweight before pregnancy and it fits fine all the way to the end of pregnancy. I have always had to wear it on the loosest latch.
8179,1,"Bought this for our flat changing pad, which it fits. However, it's very cheaply made, not. Like the plush contoured pads. Was expecting it to be a little thicker than it is, but still gets the job done."
84800,1,"I have to use playtex disposable bottles because my baby has a major problem with air and these bottles help her take in less. I do not like the drop ins though. When taking the air out, I had had many leak and burst whereas the standard ones won't. The standard liners are cheaper, you get more and although they're a little more time consuming when fixing bottles, they're very sturdy and well worth the extra time!"
21137,2,I was thinking ... J&J; read my mind!I wanted to purchase J&J; baby oilbut when I saw this product I thoughtit was the best of both worlds.It says it moisturizes like an oilbut feels like a lotion.It feels like a lotion but it certainlydoes not moisturize very well.The skin absorbs the lotion quicklybut I don't feel my skin feeling moisturized.Sometimes it leaves a slight chalky feelingto my skin.I thought a brand like Johson*Johnsonwould make a better product.I'd say ... just stick with Cocoa Butter.That seems to be the cheapest and works the best.
50377,0,"I got my pillow as a gift from www.walmart.com, it's just a little over $30 there, which is a much more reasonable price than what babies r us is offering. I am a thin but tall woman and I have had some trouble with it being too short to properly curve around to my knees without tugging on my shoulders, however it has definitely made my sleep more comfortable, I rarely move in my sleep though, so I can't comment on how it moves with you in your sleep. My biggest complaint is that the filling comes out through the fabric cover and I often times inhale a fiber or two which causes an awful coughing fit and creates a tickle that never seems to go away. About 2 weeks after I got the Snoogle it started to lose shape in the area where my knees rest, which was a bit nuisance, also it is hard to get the long part under my belly for proper support, like I said I'm tall but slim, if my belly stuck out further maybe this would work better. I've always been a stomach sleeper and this pillow has been fantastic at keeping me from rolling over onto my stomach. I also wish that the manufacturer made a removable/washable cover for it.UPDATE: So the manufacturer does make a cover, but it's twenty bucks from their website and I can't seem to find it anywhere else! The pillow itself was only 34, so I'm not buying it."
169510,1,"Our one diaper bag--it's all we need. We really like the separate compartments on the outside for easy access and organization. My favorite feature is the cellphone holder on the strap, which is super handy so that I don't miss the frequent phone calls that come with having a new baby and I don't have to fumble around for it. My manly husband doesn't think twice about carrying this bag. It's comfortable for both of us to wear."
39574,1,Sleepsack is an excellent night time cover for infants that move a lot in the night. With twin girls a warm baby covered up is better than an out of swaddle cold screaming baby at night.
61742,2,I thought this was a great deal but these diapers are the worst. We had to change my son about every 90 minutes so he wouldn't leak through. They are poor quality and we ended up throwing them away. Don't waste your money!
26673,1,"I've been reading the Amazon gate reviews for a week, trying to find a pressure-mounted baby gate that doesn't fall apart, fall down, make loud noises, permit climbing, or induce injuries. But for every gate, at least one or two people make those complaints--so frustrating! I finally picked up this gate at a store because it looked un-climbable, had plenty of notches for sizing it to my doorway, and was cheap ($17 with a coupon). It works fine in my 30"" door: firm pressure and not at all hard to take up and down as needed. Contrary to the 1-star reviews, I don't think it's flimsy--what more were people expecting in this price range? The clear plastic panels are nicer looking than mesh, and my baby enjoys banging on them. Caveat: if you're thinking about keeping this gate up and stepping over it, consider your height. I'm 5'10"" and I'm already finding it a (small) nuisance. Still, after we try this one for a few more days, I expect I'll buy another."
67698,0,"It is somewhat universal in that it fits on both strollers (McClaren and Bugaboo). But I wish the inside was more snug (the cup holds, but there's always some of the beverage leaking on the stroller...or the kid on the board). For the bugaboo, the bugaboo cupholder does a better job (in terms of holding the drink), however, I have not found one that works perfectly- the bugaboo cupholder keeps falling off the stroller everytime I recline the seat!!!"
113132,1,The size that came with the pump were too small so I had to purchase the larger size. They work as described and I have to issues with them.
31001,1,"I needed a double stroller of some type for my 2 month old and my 3 1/2 year old. The traditional double stroller seemed excessive and not to mention bulky for me so I looked at the sit and stand strollers. Hands down, the Joovy Ultralight was the winner. It is very light, folds down flat, and has a mommy organizer. I know people are put off by the small basket-lack of storage- but when weighing the pros and cons I decided this was worth the sacrifice!"
171973,1,I love this tub because it is easy to use. It fits great in my sink and has a little basin to keep clean water in. My daughter fit securely on the sling when she was a newborn and now at 3 months old doesn't have problem reclining in the tub. It does not leak or cause any mess. The only problem I have is storing it but that would probably be the case with most tubs or anything else this size.
21178,1,"I registered for this basket because I live in a 3-story townhouse and thought that having a ""portable"" bed for my baby would be handy. I was right - and this basket definitely fits the bill.It's a beautiful basket, made of soft woven grass -- it's flexible and soft, not rigid and scratchy like wicker might be. The foam pad in the bottom is about 1-1/2 inches thick and is firm, so no worries about suffocation. And it's perfect for carrying my sleeping son from one floor to another without waking him.The literature that comes with the basket says it's ok to use for children weighing up to 20 pounds; I get the feeling that my little boy will be too long for the basket before he reaches 20 pounds, but that's ok. The important thing for me was to have a way to move him from floor-to-floor while he was nursing every 3 hours. The basket is a little smaller than a standard bassinet; I've been using bassinet sheets on it and just pulling the extra fabric under the pad. Works like a charm.I'd reccommend this to anyone who is considering a bassinet...especially if space is an issue or if you have a multi-floor house!"
28772,1,"I received this glider as a shower gift from friends and I have no complaints about it. We've had it about two months now and it's great! It matches the other baby furniture perfectly and works very well for our small house with very small rooms. The ottoman has started to get a little side to side wiggle, but I'm sure that will stop once we retighten some screws. I use the chair everyday and night for nursing and with a small pillow added for additional lumbar support, I frequently fall asleep in it. Compared to other more expensive models this one is just fine. I sat in a lot of gliders trying to decide on which one I liked and there were of course some pricier models that were more comfortable, but also some that were a lot less comfortable. The fabric is nice and very easy to clean (so far all stains have come out with only a damp rag). if you are a budget conscience person then this glider is perfect for you!"
89403,2,I know many people swear by Pampers and I did find their fit to be very pleasing BUT both of my children had significant allergic reactions to the light scenting added to these diapers. For parents of babies with sensitive skin these may not be the diapers for you.
25496,1,We've been pretty happy with these they are the perfect size for our many different cloth diapers. Great price great product
102546,1,It's very nice that my newborn baby look the colorful animals. The melodies are soft with excellent sound. I love the colorful animals to.
131936,1,"We got this before my son was born. He hated his car seat so this didn't get much use. We tried to sell it at a yard sale with no luck, so down to the basement it went.Then our daughter was born. She loves her car seat, and loves this product as well.I would have given it 5 stars, but the clicking noise is loud (again daughter loves it as it's a white noise to her). Also, the speed setting is very hard to get ""just right""."
49814,1,Didn't take long for our 3 year old to figure out. Maybe it is meant for smaller children. I like that it's made in the USA.
42073,1,This is a great toy for teething babies! The colors catch their attention while the different shapes keep their hands and mouths amused. The size is just right for them to actually hold on to it too. I'd recommend it to any parent of a very young child- especially for the price!
51736,1,"I love having a swing I can plug in. We haven't even used batteries in the swing yet. I like that the mobile swings out of the way and the storage nets on the sides of the swing are very helpful. I also love the size of this swing. It is smaller than any of the swings we looked at before we found this. I love that this swing reclines in 3 different angles (recline feature in the back) so we can use it for all of baby's stages. The only things I would change would be to add a head support for newborns, and the slowest speed seemed a little fast for a newborn, but as she grows and weighs more, it won't be a problem."
129533,1,"Bright, fun colors and very easy for small infant to grasp. Perhaps the best thing is that the ""wires"" are bendy, which means it is great for teething, and the toy will not hurt the baby when he/she hits him/herself in the head with it! :)"
8134,1,"When shopping for my new grandson, this beautiful basket immediately took my eye and I had to purchase it. I continued shopping-filling it with his lst Teddy Bear and other items. Looking at it I could not only see a newborn nestled amongst the eyelets, but the opportunities of future use. For now this basket will serve as a miniature bassinett when he visits and later may be utilized to hold all of his special toys, books and keepsakes. As he outgrows it- I can see it utilized in a number of ways...plants, flowers, books and even maybe the cat."
124949,1,keep em busy for a while. And good exersise for them. And you don't has to chase after them like in a walker.
141702,1,"Very pleased with this toy. My grandson loves the lights and sounds. Has a lot more activities than what I assumed, so was pleasantly surprised. Very sturdy, so not concerned when he is pushing it around. All around a great buy!"
9757,1,"This is a great little potty chair. I like its two piece design, and how easy it is to empty. I like the high back, and so does my son as he likes to ""lounge"" as he uses it. The only downside is that the piece the comes out does sometimes stick to his behind so when he stands up there is potential for a mess, but this will be true with any two piece plastic chairs. I really like the no slip grips on the bottom of the chair so my son can't scoot it across the floor. All in all, I would probably buy this chair again."
144964,1,"I was looking for something like this for a Baby shower gift basket and overall this is what I wanted, but the waffle fabric liners seemed to be made out of a cheap fabric instead of something that can withstand the repetitive washing I'm sure they're going to need. The ribbons were also a bit frayed along the edges and a couple were just thrown in the bottom of the baset instead of in the little plastic zip lock bag. Maybe I got a used/returned product instead of one fresh off the shelves."
178784,0,"The item is great however, its for babies 18pds and under. BabyBjorn has a 25 pds cut off, that is a stretch."
118368,2,"I was so excited to buy these with our first daughter. I thought it was really neat how easy it was to transition from the Avent bottles to the sippy cups and it is really cool because the nipples from the bottles also fit the sippy cups but the trouble starts when you replace the nipples with the white sippy cup spout. LEAK, LEAK, LEAK.... I tried everything to get these cups not to leak. There is a plastic piece that fits on the inside that is suppose to keep the fluid from leaking out but it doesnt work well at all! Definitely cheaper brands out there that work much better. I finally just threw mine in the trash!!"
93543,2,"I wish that I would have read the reviews before buying this product. My 19 month old daughter was too fascinated with the musical chime and quickly figured out how to activate it by touching the sensor with her finger rather than actually sitting down. Who wants to encourage their child to put their hands in the potty? Not me! Also- the musical chime is sporadic-sometimes it would work and sometimes not. Sometimes it would chime when no one was even near it! Then the battery died after only one week! I tried to take it back because we had not actually tried to go potty on it yet- we just got it to introduce her to it, but I did not have the box and Toys R Us told me to call Fisher Price. Fisher Price apologized and issued me a manufacter's coupon for the purchase price. I then went and got a quiet potty!"
94241,1,"my daughter loves her jumper, we started using it around 4.5 months. we use it in our tv room which has a double opening so we dont have any trouble with smashed fingers. she is short but chunky, 25"" and 17lbs. and we have no trouble with adjustments."
127266,1,"I am very pleased with this crib! It is beautiful and extremely sturdy, as others have said. It also matches the other DaVinci products perfectly. My son and daughter are now sharing a room since we have baby #3 on the way. He has the DaVinci Elizabeth toddler bed in cherry and these two pieces go well in the room together. I will say that my son's bed has a few indentions and digs after a year and a half but no major scratches. It took my husband a little bit longer than expected to assemble (he is typically very quick w/ these types of things). And one of pieces of hardware was stripped so we had to find a replacement at Lowe's. I would still recommend this crib to anyone. It has a very commanding presence when you walk in the room and looks much more expensive than it was."
26792,1,"I don't jog, so I can't say it's a great jogging stroller, but I bought it at my local Target last year on sale for about $80 and I LOVE IT!! The only thing I could have asked for more than what it already has would be a child tray, although just now I was wiping it down and noticed great mesh pockets in by the child. That will be great when he is old enough to figure out how to use them. It folds down very nicely for a good sized jogging stroller, and has pockets just about everywhere (I've had mine a year and, see, I'm still finding pockets!). I think that the very best feature it has is the hood - it is very long, and the whole thing rotates so you can adjust it as you turn into and out of the sun. Personally I have noticed no problems with the front wheel, but, again, I only walk with it. This is great for almost any use - even every day."
100428,1,"We couldn't be happier with the Pampers products in general. We've had some nasty ""messes"" on our hands and these keep everything well contained AND are thin for our little man to move around comfortably."
184475,0,"Not sure if this was worth the money. It constantly goes off...when my dog shakes or plays. It does work in water, just do not like all the false alarms."
35462,1,I purchased the floppy seat when my daughter was 5 months old. She's been using it ever since. She is now 16 months old and still loves it. It's great in shopping carts and high chairs. I can't tell you how many people have stopped us and asked about it. The reviewer who said her baby fell out just wasn't using it right because it has a strap that loops through the cart seat bars and latches around baby. There's no way a baby could fall out if you use it correctly. Definetely worth the money. Probably the best baby product I have.
75892,1,I give these for baby gifts -they are the bestI have bought many and every recipient agrees they are great
133131,2,"My son is 13 monthes old and up until this time i would have recommended this product to anyone. I even bought one as a shower gift. Since my son has started solid foods, it has been horrible. I have had to move it out of the babies room and into the hall. I have even started empting it everyday. Now that it is in the hall my living room smells. I keep this thing clean and frequently spray it with lysol. Up until this point I guess because my son was breastfeed and solids weren't his main source of food it wasn't that bad. I have used a diaper genie before and found it a lot of effort but if it means no smell, i will get it. You can't but a price on having a freash smelling house."
76778,1,"Stuff is great. Simple, easy to use, and not messy. Was perfect as I was putting it in a nursery. As you are able to readjust it as you go, it was a lot easier to use as our walls are rather crooked due to it being an old farm house.Only cons would be you need to have a flat surface you are applying it to. Very flat. Any type of unevenness causes air bubbles. And due to the sticker like quality it tends to cling like plastic wrap to anything it brushes against."
156269,1,I purchased several bottles of this product for my daughter. She has used this product for the past five years for her first child and now uses it for her second child. We love the essence of baby freshness on the children after their bath. My daughter had tried different products periodically but always returns to huggies shea butter wash!
96632,1,Love this step stool. We are using it in my daughter's room since she went to a full sized bed from her crib. It's very sturdy and she LOVES it.
155926,1,Love it! Fits the pad beautifully and seems to get softer everytime you wash it.
153064,0,"I bought this seat for my 4 year old so I could have him in a harness longer than his other seat that went to 40lbs. This is a nice seat and we loved the side impact protection. Unfortunately, when we put him in the seat his sat on top of the crotch strap instead of it being in front of him. So, in other words, his "" jewels"" we crushed when we tried to buckle it. Needless to say, he kept saying ""TOO TIGHT, MOMMY!"" I'm returning the seat tomorrow. Try your child in this before you buy. The decathlon does have a 3 position crotch strap, the marathon and roundabout do not, but there's more room in those compared to the boulevard."
173377,1,"We purchased this swing for our daughter when I was still pregnant. I noticed that the swing had more features than any of the other swings, although, I did not think that she would need them (such as the two-way swing direction, rotating mobile and mirror, nature sounds, etc.). I thought that these were just extras that were geared to new parents who believed that their babies would benefit from all the extra ""bells and whistles"". Obviously, I was COMPLETELY against purchasing this swing due to the higher price tag and seemingly useless extras. My husband fell in love with the swing on the spot and insisted on getting it for his little princess. I eventually agreed, but thought it was a waste of money. BOY WAS I WRONG!!This thing is absolutely WONDERFUL! Our little girl falls asleep in it as she is soothed by the nature sounds and the spinning mobile. She loves to stare at herself in the mirror overhead. It is definately one of the best... no wait... THE BEST purchase we made for our little girl!The toy pockets are very handy for storing ""binkys"", toy bears and receiving blankets for quick access while she is relaxing. The swing is easily moved from room to room, which comes in handy when you need to take a shower and it easily sets right back up!Check this swing out in the store before you buy it and you will also agree that the craftsmanship is very durable and high quality! Definatly worth the price!Our friends have this swing also and they swear by it too! As a matter of fact, we know very few people who DO NOT have this swing! Everyone says it is a GODSEND! I agree and so does our little princess!"
117794,1,This jumper is wonderful. My 10 month old daughter has the best time and it is so fun to watch her. I got it for her when she was about 8 months old and so wish I purchased it sooner. I keep it in my kitchen doorway and she can hang out with me as I cook and clean in there. I haven't had any issues with safety like tipping backward or her bumping her hands into the doorway (I think there were some reviews that mentioned this). The bumper portion seems to work pretty well. Especially now that she is older and all over the place. Love it!
58341,1,"This mobile is the absolute best thing I've bought for the baby so far!!! He is 2 1/2 months old and has been in awe of the mobile since I bought it when he was only a few weeks old. He laughs, smiles, giggles, talks, and just throughly enjoys his mobile and there have been many times I've taken it off the wall and just entertained him in another room with it. It doesn't match a thing in his room but I wouldn't change it for the world."
135641,1,The shipping was fast. Haven't used them yet because son is not due for a few more months but I used this kind of bottle with my last son.
126650,2,"Our little guy has been a Pampers wearer since birth. We took a risk going with Huggies. Unfortunately the great price isn't enough to keep us buying. The first thing I noticed was the size...smaller than size one Pampers. Secondly was the leaking. They just don't hold the urine! I expect to change blowouts that leak....but todays diapers should hold daytime pee! I am constantly changing diapers that leak....with hardly any urine. So even though I bought a lot of diapers for a great price, changing so often makes the price negligible. For reference I have a long and lean little guy!"
31658,0,Was a gift to my daughter for her new Baby but it looks like it should work great for the bottles she bought/I bought for her
143823,1,"I have bought and returned three gates to use for our golden retriever puppy because they either didn't fit the door opening tightly or were a real pain to put together and operate. Even though this gate is expensive, it is heavy, tall and fits the odd sized openings that need blocking in our house. It would be nice if it had a swinging gate in it, but it's not that big of a deal to move it to get through. I squirted a non-staining, non-alcohol dog repellant on the top rail and so far the puppy (and our older dog) haven't tried to jump up on it or push on it. I like that it was so easy to put together and can be moved from one location to another without dismantling it or unhooking it from the doorway. And it's pretty."
64828,1,"This swing is perfect even if you dont live in a small space...we have a big house and decided not to invest in a standard swing for many reasons...1) we could take this swing from room to room while baby was in it, took from family room to office to kitchen, even up and down stairs! 2) did not create clutter, we could stow it anywhere, folded nicely in the closet, basement, laudry room, even bathroom while company came over! With a new baby trust me the house will get cluttered!!!3) its portability was nice, we took it along with us to ppl's houses who did not have kids, our son loved sitting in it...we did not have to constantly worry about who is going to hold him, where to lay him to sleep, where to feed him, etc..4) serves as a swing, bassinet, lounge chair, and highchair for at least 5 months. Our son lived in this thing when he would be in the family room and we couldnt tend to him.this swing was a lifesaver, the durability is bette rthan i expected for a product labeled as ""portable"" i loved it! the battery issue needs to be addressed. We have only inserted batteries once into this thing in 6 months! there is no need to constantly have the lights on as well as the music...those are extra perks if your kid really wont seem to settle down. We mostly used the swing controls and it has lasted us. There is an option for lights and sound only when u pull on the fish, and thats what our swing is always set at. i think battery use is good on this."
99021,0,"I like pampers diapers. These hold pee very well but not so much poop. My daughter is breastfed so it is kind of watery and with the baby dry diapers, it wouldn't soak it up and would run out of the back of the diaper. They also made my daughter break out with a rash. Overall I wouldn't get these again. Go with the Pampers Swaddler diapers."
172290,2,"I ordered the product online to avoid the long haul to the Babies R Us store in my area. The box was shipped without being wrapped first. The package arrived smashed on one end, ripped on one corner and someone wrote all over the box. Since it was intended to be a gift, I had to go to the store anyway so I could return it for one that was presentable.Since it was purchased off a registry, it was obivously a gift and should have been shipped in a manner that would prevent damage."
46939,2,Title Says it all.Can't believe people actually use these. I tried the once and tossed them in the trash.
165047,0,I have been using these diapers since my daughter was born and what I like about them is that they are super absorbent. My daughter has a lot of blowouts and I think they would be much worst if she wasn't wearing these diapers.
87871,1,"We registered for this gymini after reading all of the great reviews and hearing great things, and we were not disappointed! My daughter is now 6 months old and she STILL loves playing in this gym. Whether it's laying on her back playing with the little toys (especially the mirror) or rolling on her tummy and playing with her toys on the black and white mat, she loves this item! The high contrast (black, white, red) grabs her attention. She has used this for a full 6 months, and she is still enjoying it, so it is definitely worth the money. You can hang lots of different things from the bars, so baby never gets bored. My daughter also chews on the bars (great for teething). Also, the mat washes really well and does not fade. We even use the mat like a blanket to play on (just take the bars off). I think this is my daughter's most favorite toy (and we have lots)! I definitely recommend it."
63701,1,"This is a great shopping cart cover! The cost is a little more than other covers but is definately worth the extra money. It covers every part of the cart your baby can touch. I am even able to use it over restaurant high chairs (not a perfect fit - but covers everything). There are little loops to hook toys into in the front and inside side pockets to stash snacks or whatever (I hide my wallet in there while shopping sometimes). It is a bit large when folded (to big to fit in diaper bag if you have more than a few diapers in it), but that is due to the nice soft and durable fabric. It comes in a plastic carrying case with a handle (I'm guessing it's about 12""x8"" and about 2""thick - I leave mine in the car). I just wish I would have found this sooner - my daughter loves it too. Would be a great gift for a baby shower."
75073,0,"I looked everywhere for a big diaper bag that looked nice. I thought that I had found the one. I loved it when I got it in the mail and could not wait to use it, it was not even a month of use and the zipper broke and then the sides starting coming apart. If i had to do it over again I would not spend 70 on something that is going to fall apart!"
105294,1,I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended. The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment. The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight. I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it. That would be my only complaint.
91383,0,"This was the second monitor we purchased. We thought we had to replace an older version of the same thing. We are still using the older one (now 5 yrs old) and return this ""Sounds N Light"" version.This one looked fancy but everywhere we placed it had static. All settings/channels/volume still gave a static hiss. We have alot of wireless items in the house so that may have been affecting it. However the old one (also made by Fisher Price) doesnt have this problem. The static wasnt a problem with the baby, they never heard it. But trying to sleep next to it all night long would just drive us nuts."
103041,2,"We used it once when my son was first learning to sit up, but he didn't really like it, and the suction cups didn't work on our textured bathtub. so we went back to using his ""Whale of a tub"" and that has worked great, and now that it's too small, he has no problems sitting up on his own."
46396,1,We bought one of these play yards for our baby daughter and it was so handy we bought a second one. They are great for both indoor and outdoor use. It's great to have somewhere safe to put the little one when they are mobile. A definite must have for little ones on the go!
169993,1,"We bought this for our daughter's nursery a year ago. My husband had it assembled fairly quickly, and it looks beautiful! The color is great, too. Our daughter is now 11 months old and pulls herself up with the bar in front but I've had no problems with her getting her arms stuck or anything. It is a great crib and great quality. I will definitely buy another one like this when we have another baby."
158707,1,"Love their products. Our son's been in halo sleepsacks since he was 1 month old. Back then he used the swaddlers, then transitioned over at about 4 months to a newborn sleep sack, then to a small. And now we're onto the medium sizes. Crazy how they grow.This is a really cute print. I love the light turqoise-ish color with cute little owls on it. This sleep sack has served us well. Durable, breathable and best of all, safe. I think my son's so used to having a sleep sack on, I don't know what he'll do when we eventually switch to a blanket!We however, live in CA and get 100+ degree weather here during the summers and I just wish that halo also makes a thinner muslin version of this sleep sack for the really hot weather places. Make a muslin version to compete with aden and anis please!"
24980,1,"This gate is incredible! I have 2 older children (10 and 8)and &quot;back in the day&quot; I used the plastic tension gate and stepped (tripped) over it carrying kids, toys, etc. This is so easy to install and use, HANDS FREE! I am so glad we have this gate this time around! It is quite sturdy: my HUGE 12 month old grabs the bars and shakes and it stays in place. I can step on the pedal and the door opens easily with my knee. It is worth the extra few bucks to have the hands free convenience everyday!"
16710,1,I have a 3 month old son and he's had this since he was almost a month old and he loves to punch and smack at the star and planet. He doesn't like the song it plays but rather enjoys the clinking of the links that hold the toys and the blocks on the side bar when they clack together.
148493,2,"Do not buy this product for a number of reasons. It does not stick well, the mirror itself is not made of glass and everything just looks blurry and it never really hides behind the actual rear view mirror, like it does in the picture. It is not worth the money."
22124,0,"This product is fine, does what it's supposed to (hold milk). I never had any spillage but I do wish it had a double zipper like some other brands (Lanisoh). Just would have made me feel less anxious about possible spills. Also I don't feel like the oz count was accurate. You could have like 2 oz of milk in there and easily interpret it as 3 or 4 based on the markings on the outside. But again, those are just little complaints because all in all it did what it's supposed to do."
122227,2,"I tried it out once and didn't like it. I was not able to see my baby to help her latch on despite the large neck opening. And the opening was too large to the point that in some positions I would've felt too exposed if around anyone else. I decided the ribbed neck covers are much better for me. However, if you've somehow mastered the nursing covers without the ribbed neck, then this might be okay. The material is unbelievably soft and it's very attractive."
43749,1,"Unfortunately, if you have the gate... you will probably have to buy the extension.The extension itself, is very easy to install... it pretty much just side in on either side of the gate. So 5 stars for an easy install.Not much to say but it's most likely a must have product, because an average size hallway will need this extension."
181582,1,"The Kiddopotimus Swaddler is a lifesaver! My colicky baby is colicky no more and I am now getting much needed sleep. He loves it and sleeps much better because of it. If your baby is colicky, buy a supply of these and a few Avent binkies (the only brand my little man will take) and enjoy the peace and quiet!"
58964,1,"I think some of the other reviewers have forgotten the golden rules here, you MUST READ INSTRUCTIONS. This unit is not to CLEAN bottles and such, it's a sterilizer only. As in the instructions, as I'm reading, and typing from in front of me here... &quot;BEFORE EACH USE - 1) Before sterilising, wash all items in mild soapy water and rinse.&quot; If after a while you're still getting a film, you need to rub neat salt on the bottles and nipples, it's a build up of milk fat.This product does EVERYTHING it states, and if cared for properly should last a long time, I purchased mine in September 1993, right 1993!!! And it works just fine to date after a long vacation in storage."
58401,1,The best! I highly recommend these. I recently bought these to put with another gift for a baby shower at Church. They were greatly appreciated.
43408,1,The Graco Frame is easy to use with a push of a button to open and to close there is a twist and push lever on the push handle. I have the Snugride carseat and this is truely a back saver. My little one is now almost double his birthweight at 13lbs and it is hard to carry him in just the carseat. The stroller is pretty light weight but heavier than an umbrella stroller it is sturdy and very easy to use.
56269,1,Loved this monitor. It lasted 3 years before the monitor just quit. We used this one almost every day for those 3 years. We were so happy with this one we bought another summer infant one when our other child was born.
68014,0,"Used this to gate check our stroller on a trip to Mexico. Large, roomy bag that fit our Peg Perego Si (a larger umbrella stroller) with room to spare. Found 2 small-ish tears on the return trip home. I know the bag was relatively cheap ($15 Canadian compared to $40 for the Peg Perego bag), but I do think that it ought to last longer than one round trip. It does make me wonder how careless and rough the baggage handlers are, even with gate checked items, and how much worse shape my stroller would have been in without the bag."
125433,1,My grandson just loves this teether. It is soft enough all the way around but still bumby enoungh to help with the teething.
62440,0,"My 1-year-old daughter loves looking at pictures -- of herself, her family, friends, pets, fun stuff cut from magazines, etc. This book is good, but only holds a few shots. For 3 bucks at Target, you can get a real, soft-sided, pocket-size photo holder (not officially a baby toy) -- but it's safe, durable and holds nearly 20 pictures. That's the toy she looks at often (and for large blocks of time)."
140124,2,"This is a waste of money. First of all, the light is worthless. It is not bright enough to see anything. Second of all, after about a month the mirror was so scratched looking I couldn't even see my daughter in the daytime. I don't know what made the mirror do this as we never touched it or cleaned it with anything. My daughter was only a month old so I know she couldn't have scratched it. Like I said, save your money and get something that will actually entertain your child. Forget about the light, it is a good concept but it just doesn't work."
164335,1,I absolutely love these diapers. They fit my son very well and are nice and thin. They are not bulky and they also contain the stinky poo smell nicely. They are a good quality and they don't make much noise. I really love Pampers!
123328,2,"I found my babys toe all blody in the play yard. He was crying and i was so upset when I saw it. This play yards net is very hard and my baby likes to play without socks since it is so hot. I am going to return it even though the colors is nice and it is big. My friend got one too when she sow mine, however she told me that her's corners are braking. I hope they will recall it, IT IS DANGEROUS FOR BABYS."
133294,1,"I ordered these bottles to replace my Dr. Brown's bottles when my daughter was about 5 months because they were BPA free. I was worried that she wouldn't take the new bottles well because they were a different size and shape but she didn't hesitate at all.We have had no problems with these bottles. She is now 11 months and they have held up great.The one thing that I didn't like about the Dr. Brown's bottles I originally had was all of the different parts. While the Born Free bottles have just as many parts to wash, you do not need a special small brush for these like you do with the Dr. Brown's bottles which I like."
159879,2,"This seemed like such a nice gate when I bought it-- I loved the fact that it didn't have a lattice or holes for my son to use as grips to climb up with, and I liked the way it looked in general-- but as soon as I got it installed I realized it was a mistake. I have the same problem others have mentioned here with the gate refusing to stay the same width after it has supposedly been locked. Every time I open and close it, the one of the sliding panels inches slightly outward, so that by the 3rd or 4th time it's been open and shut I have to readjust it again because it won't open at all, which is REALLY annoying. It might work well as a pressure-mounted gate, but as a swinging gate, it's next to worthless.Also, did anyone else notice that the screws they included were really cheap, and started to strip very easily?"
109222,1,This tray turns your Bumbo seat into a great place for baby to eat. I have a full size high chair I got as a baby shower gift but most of the time baby just eats in her Bumbo. It's also great when your traveling if you have a space saving high chair seat .
43054,1,I bought this seat for many reasons (not in order of importance): 1) it's pink 2) had great ratings 3) free shipping 4) it had cup holders 5) side impact protection and 6) appropriate placement of shoulder belt. My daughter loves how it looks and feels. It is very soft and well padded. The cup holders aren't very deep and we've had trouble keeping cups/bottles of water in at least one of them. We've found that our daughter doesn't lean back into the head rests unless she wants to sleep. She leans forward so she can talk to and see her brother. Overall we really like it.
117429,1,This works well everywhere and offers good support for the 7 month old . He really enjoys it and it is easy to use..
54733,2,"When I had purchased the Symphony Animal Mobile,I was excited and so was my son at 6mo old. After a couple of days my son was in his crib playing and I hurd a noice and animal mobile had fallen on to my son and from that point on it kept falling everytime my son would play with it."
182978,1,I love the smell of baby phisoderm and unfortunatly I haven't been able to find it at any local stores. It leaves my babies skin soft and smooth.
81836,2,"I bought this pump when I had latch on problems and my milk wasnt coming in. The doctors recommended I get a breast pump to help establish my milk. I looked at all the pumps and wound up buying this one because it was more affordable. I used it for two weeks and just gave up and bought the Medela Pump In Style which was VERY expensive because I felt it just wasnt doing the job. After using the Pump In Style, I got a noticible amount of milk the first week I used it. This pump, I thought, was more comfortable than my Pump In Style but it seems it can only be used for occasional pumping."
111025,1,I got this for my friend who just had a baby. It is the perfect gift. She uses it everyday.
120802,2,We ordered 2 of these gates and both of them are noisy and loud every time you open them. I thought maybe we got a lemon on the first one but when we installed the second one on the lower floor it makes the same rubbing to metal sound every time you open the gate. Also sometimes when it swings to shut the gate doesn't always latch so you have to Double check to make sure that it latches. Not impressed. Would NOT buy again.
97056,0,"My mom bought this for us as a shower gift. It's been nice to have but not essential. First of all the heart beat needs to be slightly quicker. Second, the jungle sounds are a little too stimulating for my little one. She likes them when she is awake but as far as playing them at night...it keeps her attention so then keeps her awake. The white noise one is the best one overall. It does have a couple of different settings but I wish it would let me play it continuously instead of having set limits. I know I would go through batteries fasster but let that be my choice."
24309,0,"We loved using the cosleeper for our newborn's first month of life. The sheets, however, are not of the same quality as the cosleeper product itself. They shrink (I did use the dryer--no time to air dry). They also ripped in the corner when trying to get them on the mattress pad (due the the shrinkage, most likely.) But, if you want to use the cosleeper and want extra sheets, I believe this is your only bet."
138528,1,"This is a great, magical product. My 3 y/o daughter loves it, and uses it every night as a night light and sleepy-time friend. I must inform you that this is her second Twilight Turtle, as the first one stopped working for whatever reason...no response to new batteries, after two years of nightly use. That's why I have rated this product 4 instead of 5 stars, since I'm not sure it should have ""died"" like that, since it was not abused, dropped, stomped on or otherwise battered. It lived a pretty cushy life, as a matter of fact. Still, the bottom line is that my kid loves it, loves being able to turn it on herself & change the colors, plus it's transportable, so you're not stuck with only one starlit room in your home. (This is particularly useful when spending the night at Grandma's house.) So I would buy the Turtle again, though I hope we don't have to. The second incarnation seems a little better-constructed than the first, with stitched eyes (rather than glued), and a slightly thicker shell. And finally, we have the Ladybug too--thanks to an indulgent Auntie--equally loved, so a good product, no matter which creature you choose."
19652,0,"I purchased this product with my first child. It worked well for a while until the button you click to start the warmer popped out. I could still use it but constantly had to re-adjust the warmer button which was a huge pain. And you have to wipe the warmer out after every few uses. The inside turns brown and starts to smell if you don't. Also...the vile that you use to measure the water depending on what size botton you are warming needs to be gently hand washed. The numbers rubbed off completely on the side of the vial showing you how much water to use for your bottle to be warmed and I had to get a permanent marker and re-label it. All in all it is a decent product, easy to use as well but doesn't hold up for very long. I have twins on the way so I won't purchase this product again."
64974,2,The product you purchase is not the item shown in the picture. The product is nice all the same. But I like to receive what I think I am getting.
102223,1,"Having triplets, I bought this stroller to have the convenience of having more choices. I would really recommend it; it is very manageable, light and comfortable. Also, the price is right. It folds right up so it fits our SUV great."
160087,1,"After trying multiple times to copy the amazing nurses at the hospital, I gave up on my swaddling attempts. My boy just squirmed until he freed a hand and then ruined all my attempts at a burrito wrap! My step mother gave us one of these and I love it! It's soft, easy and quick to use, and our son doesn't squirm out of it. He sleeps better...meaning we ALL sleep better! I'll be buying more!"
106534,0,"We ordered the Diaper Champ after the lid broke on our Diaper Genie. We really liked the idea of being able to use regular trash bags instead of special refills. Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like. First off all, the opening for the dirty diapers is small and tube shaped so you have to be sure that the diaper is perfectly folded to make sure you don't get ""waste"" on it. Secondly, it does NOT keep the smell in. Ever since we got the Diaper Champ, my sons room smells like pee! We have been taking poopy diapers to outside trash immediatley and using plastic grocery bags to put pee pee diapers in before putting them in the Diaper Champ so this product has defintiley not saved us time and we are using more plastic than we used before which is what we did not want! Honeslty, we will probably sell this or give it away and buy another Diaper Genie."
60028,1,My son is 5 months old and i just switched from the 4 in one stage (really 2 in one)bath (horrible tub)...but already with this tub my son is comfortable and splashes around for the first time..my both hands are finally free to bathe him...yes its big but its worth it...when i wash him he lays down. with all those curves he does not move around..then I will sit him up for fun time and he just has a ball..absoulutely recommend this bath tub. I just wish I had this for the past 5 months..he will use this for a long time
9180,2,"I was excited to get this product. The cd player was a gift off my baby regisry and i ran out and bought c batteries only to be let down by the outcome of performance of this product. I played a baby einstein classical music cd for 1 minute to test the product out and was unpleasantly surprised by the horrible sound quality. All i heard was static with a bit of music in the background. This product is going right back to the store. I recommend getting a little boombox made by sony or an electronics brand instead of this product. It seemed like a good idea, especially since it hooks on to the crib and has a nightlight, but i bought the product mainly for the ability to play clear music. don't waste your time or your money."
99410,1,"I've been using these diapers (with varing sizes) for the past year. Never any problems. Love them. Even more, I LOVE subscribe and save. It saves me so much time to not have to remember to pick up diapers from the store. I never run out!!!"
113041,1,"My 2 year old daughter is a huge Dora fan, so when I found these cups I just had to buy them for her. They are cute, durable, insulated, and hold quite a bit. They have been in the dishwasher many, many times and still look as good as the day I bought them. And best of all, my daughter loves her Dora cups. They're well worth the money."
78352,2,"I bought this booster seat without checking the reviews like I normally do, and what a dissaster! The tray broke (locking clip on left side broke off) and now my 1 year old can easily pop off the tray with one kick of his leg. The tray itself is not adjustable so as he gets bigger he will outgrow it. The booster is not as compact as I thought, so I don't really know how much better of a traveling seat it is than others. So next time....I will check the reviews first! Lesson learned."
19156,2,Material waaaay to thin and flimsy. Ring does not hold weight of a baby. Baby could easily fall right out. Instructions terrible. Immediately bought me a Mosby wrap to use instead of this crap.
59471,1,"i am pregnant now, but after my sister had her son this was the only thing that saved our backs! rather than having to ""hope"" you grabbed everthing you needed it was all right there for you. and you can fit so much into it. diapers, to lotions, to wipes, i mean EVERYTHING. i knew this would be one of the first things i would need!"
7202,1,my grandaughter sits well in chair seat. Sits still longer than in high chair. soft and wipes clean easily
59397,1,"This is great to keep necessities close at hand. Also, I don't understand people saying that the wipes warmer does not fit. The Prince Lionheart Ultimate wipes warmer fits securely. It has two slots on the bottom that slide on to the diaper depot. It even says on the box that it is made to fit. Maybe it has been changed since others' reviews-it fits perfectly and works great!!"
49793,1,"I love this latch because when the fridge door closes, it automatically locks. So if I turn my back for a second, I know my son can't open the door. Brilliant and easy to install."
87583,0,"The stroller is very nice. It took a little time to put it together because the instructions are not at all clear. There are a few steps that were just pictures - like how to fold the stroller for travel - that were not clear. And after throwing the box away, after two uses, the tray in front of the baby will not lock in place."
180764,1,"This mat is very nice and easy to assemble. It is of a fair size which will accommodate your baby with space to spare. It has a set of 4 color lights on top, shining and catching the attention of your baby. It also has music with 2 volume settings. The batteries are installed on the big orange giraffe, and it is hard to get to them, which is exactly what you want for the safety of your baby. The mat has many ""attractions"" for your baby, from monkeys hanging from the tail to toucans to zebras. It is very well made. My baby boy is not 3 months yet and he just lays there watching everything and trying to grab all! :-) I would highly recommend this mat, it helps your baby with his/her motor skills."
69559,1,"These deliver as promised - easy to use & wash, no leaking, cute, grandma-friendly! But I prefer the bumGenius one-size pockets because they have a more finished, professional look. Other than my personal preference for looks, you can't go wrong with these."
119624,2,"I had a problem with bursts of static coming through the transmitter of this monitor in the nursery. I could understand there being static on the receiver, but not the transmitter that was in the nursery. I called Fisher Price who said that was normal and it had to be interference within my home or around it. I had already tried everything - positioning it differently, changing channels, disconnecting cordless phone,etc. I gave it to a friend who had the same problem and returned it. I purchased another 900 mz monitor (First Years) that works perfectly in my house. I was very disappointed with the Soothing Dreams Monitor and Fisher Price's response to my concern."
113458,0,"Since we have a high table in our home, normal high chairs could not work for our baby. After searching and reading reviews, we chose this booster seat to be the main eating area for our child. It looked durable, clean and has a name we trust. Our baby began eating in it at 4 months and is now 8 months. Recently we have found bruises on her back and looked for the cause. Our child is not in daycare and is in our care all day. We realized that when she gets excited, she bounces up and down in her seat. The back of this booster seat is hard and is the reason she has these bruises on her back. We now place a small pillow behind her to solve this problem. I would caution any parent from buying this seat or any others without a padding on the back. No parent wants to see thier child harmed, especially if they know they could prevent it."
160447,1,"This definitely made my son want to use the potty. Soft and comfy for his skinny bottom, didn't leave marks from sitting like a hard, plastic potty chair does. Step stool very handy as well."
28640,1,"While this may be the first glider we've owned, my wife and I very picky in finding great products at great deals and this one fits in beautifully.The packaging was excellent, and the wood stain couldn't be better. Note: This is one of the darker Espresso finishes so keep that in mind if matching to Espresso furniture from other makers (I think a few others have a lighter finish... not truely espresso).Putting this together was far easier than I thought and can easily be done in fifteen minutes or so. The quality seems quite solid, but we've only had it for three weeks or so.The product itself would get four stars, but at this price it's easily five stars. We could have easily spent $300 plus at most stores for what I believe to be the exact same stuff.Great Deal!"
139438,0,"I bought this as a gift for a new born. It serves as a night light right now. I was kind of disappointed because the turtle really needs to be placed in the center of a room so that you can see the whole starry sky. Basically, that is not where it feasibly can be placed. Hopefully, the child will be able to play with it when she gets older."
47718,1,"This product is great for tummy time and as a crib wedge. Ours came in one piece, as described. With our 4.5lb preemie, we threw a blanket over the wedge and used it for tummy time. This really helped her strengthen her neck better than just laying on the floor. Then, we used it to 'help' her roll over. This gave her momentum and cushioned the landing for her head. We now use as a wedge in her crib."
73621,1,Saw this at the store when I was doing my registry and thought it'd be a waste of money. Received this as a gift (about a month after my baby was born). Such a life saver! Now I wish I had this from day 1. Really helps me keep track of time - especially since my brain has turned to mush these days. I don't have to worry about relying on memory or writing things down. And I think it will help when I get to the medication stage. Won't have to keep track of when next dosage is due. Love it so much I decided to get this for someone as a gift so they can have it from day 1. Highly recommended!!
8085,1,"So refreshing to get something that is exactly as advertised. Fits well, good quality, washes well, looks good. Must have with the Tripp Trapp."
82878,0,"Our baby is a very light sleeper, and this product helps her fall asleep, as well as help her stay asleep.Therein lies the problem though. The sheep, in an effort to help the owner save on batteries, has a timing device that shuts the sound off automatically. The longest setting is for 45 minutes. So, after 45 minutes we either have to be on hand to turn it back on, or she will soon wake up because of her sensitivity to noise. I wish there was an ""infinity"" setting as well.So, the product works, but if your baby is very noise sensitive and wakes up easily, you may want to look for an option that works continuously."
163197,1,This product is very helpful when it comes to bath time. I've even used it for my dog! Sure beats adding towels under my knees on a hard bathroom floor and the gel is super comfy. You can also adjust the seat setting for different sized people which is a plus.
37777,2,"They are a great product if your child takes to the trainer set, other wise, inquisitive children get distracted by them, specially because of the color choices instead of making them clear or white."
5602,1,"I bought this product several weeks ago and use it almost every night when giving my baby his bath. It is a lifesaver for my knees! Before, my knees used to start aching while I was kneeling. This cushions my knees, and the elbow rest is also very comfortable. I don't agree with the other reviewers that said the armrest isn't the right height -- it must be their bathtubs because it fits perfectly on my tub without the storage bag bunching or sagging. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the little rubber feet on the bottom of the stool come off when I lift the stool, so I don't move it away from the tub. It could just be a problem with my stepstool, though."
119232,1,"I bought the Snuggly two years ago, when my son was 6 months old. I wasn't satisfied with the Bjorn because my lower back started to act up after carrying him for a few hours (mind you, I'm 1.88m tall, [6'3""], and weigh 95 kilos, [200lbs]), and work out nearly everyday. Hence, not being a 90-pound weakling, I never would have guessed that carrying a 10 kilo baby would ever strain my back, but it did. Then I came across the Snuggly. Let me tell you, it's fantastic. I still use it occasionally, even though my son now weighs 15 kilos (32lbs.) which is close to the recommended maximum. My son actually begs for it, because it so, well, snuggly... The size he is now, I have to carry him facing me again so he can wrap his legs around my rump. That way, he takes off quite a bit of load. But even without this, the balance and weight distribution of the Snuggly are perfect. It's like carrying a well-balanced rucksack (I was in the military for 2 years and go camping frequently, so I happen to know one or two things about rucksack/backpacks).The various belts and buckles take some dry practicing but one gets used to it easily. The cupholder is nifty for holding the child's drink and there's plenty of snaps etc. to attach pacifiers and the lot.I recently purchased one for a friend who'd fathered a baby, and he's wild about it too!"
23559,1,"This is a really good deal. I really liked that the gates come with extensions. I'm glad I opted for the swing gate since climbing over them several times a day isn't really an option. We spend most of our time on the second floor of a 3 story townhouse, so we are continuously going through these gates. They work well, and close automatically which is nice. They also swing in and out, so they are easy to use regardless of which way you approach them. I would recommend this set of gates to others."
21573,1,I loved this bouncer from the moment I saw it. I thought all the toys and colors were great. So far my 2 month old loves it. He loves watching the mobile and looking at the rattles. The two drawbacks I found was that the vibrator seems to be a bit noisy because of all the stuff on the seat. The mobile rattles a bit and we have had to hit it a couple of times to get the vibrator to work. Thought it may be the batteries but even with new ones it seems to work fast sometimes and slow other times. The noise isn't too bad unless you little one is in there at 3:00am trying to sleep. The other drawback is the fold down arms for the rattles. Seems like ones my son grows some more his legs won't fit under it. Overall though I do like the bouncy seat especially the angle of it. He is much more laid back and this is good when they are so little.
53581,1,"When first looking into this high chair, some of the more negative reviews made me hesitant to buy it. But the fact that it was so darned cheap made me think, ""Heck, why not."" - I needed some other items from amazon, so adding this to the shipment got me free shipping. Double score.However, my hopes weren't high...A year later, I have to admit, I still absolutely LOVE this chair!It's very sturdy (my 23lb daughter acts absolutely wild, and I don't worry at all that this will hold up), clips on well to my table with 4 1/2"" aprons (I've yet to find a table this hasn't worked on - umm... instruction manual and common sense is all it takes!), and it cleans amazingly. I've yet to disassemble it to wash because a wet rag.... or a paper towel saturated with spit (how we do it in real life?).... cleans it up just fine.Ok, ok, disinfectant wipes work better than spit...If there was anything I could change, it would be to have an assortment of colors. Black, brown, beige... neutral colors.... but... more...To be honest, though, the color doesn't bother me in the least. It was just something I thought about when I first purchased it.All in all, there is nothing bad to say about this high chair. At all."
161702,0,"My husband and I were very interested in this originally when we read how it converted into different combinations for different stages. Unfortunately, we were not able to use it very long before it started leaking - badly!!! Because of the suction cups on the bottom of the tub, you are not able to move it around very much at all. When you try to dump out the water, or move the tub to store it, you have to very carefully break the suction in the suction cups at the bottom of the tub - pretty difficult to do because they really stick to the bottom of the tub. After only a few times of ""fighting with the tub"" we noticed a definite lead in the tub. It quickly got so bad, that no sooner would we fill it with water and put our baby in it, then all the water would have leaked out the bottom! VERY frustrating! We finally just used one a relative gave us that their child outgrew. However, if you can get a lot of use out of it before it leaks, then the sling part is very nice to have."
36696,1,I haven't seen the product but my friend I had it shipped to seems to like it.. it looks to be cute..
24010,0,"This product has a major flaw for a baby that likes swaddling: their legs aren't swaddled! Should have thought of that looking at the product, but we didn't recognize the problem until our newborn kept startling herself awake kicking. (What can I say--first time parents!) Having the legs ""loose"" while the arms are swaddled doesn't make much sense to me now that we've had a little experience. Overall design seems very safe. The fleece is warm, but we have found that DD gets a bit clammy. We ended up purchasing Aden and Anais Muslin Swaddle Wraps and have found them to be perfect for swaddling, warm, and breathable."
133662,0,"We thought this door guard would help our three children ages three and under stop shutting each other's fingers in the doors but we were wrong. The Doog Guard kept falling off the side of the door once our kids realized they just had to shut the door hard a few times in order for it to fall off. They also shut the door so hard that the door guard broke.Also, it did not prevent little fingers from being stuck on the inside of the door. The door was able to close enough to still get little fingers stuck there."
157912,1,We just bought this monitor for our a 3-month old and love it. This is a great monitor especially for those babies who likes sleeping on their tummies. It detects the slightest motion and now we feel like we have peace of mind knowing that the alarm will sound if motion isn't detected. The only draw back I've found so far is that sometimes there's static that comes through on the parent unit and there are only 2 channels.
2364,1,These diapers fit my thin son wonderfully. He is extremely active and the Velcro on his diapers sticks through it all. Excellent product and particularly convenient on the mail system.
103872,1,"We got this for our first (and only) child. I honestly have ZERO experience with other baby monitors, but I can tell you this one is fantastic. Our son is now 6 months old and I have never heard even the slightest crackle of static. It's crystal clear, and has a great range. We live in an old house that is kind of drafty in the winter, so the temperature reading is really handy. Yes it's expensive, but I highly recommend it. My only negative comment is that the battery life is fairly short. You can only use it about 3 hours off of the charger base unless you have another set of rechargable batteries (which I also recommend by the way). All of this baby stuff runs on batteries. Invest in a battery charger and a whole set of rechargable batteries. It's well worth it in the long run."

63663,1,"I just received this shopping cart cover and used it twice yesterday. I have to say that it is fairly easy to get into the cart and the strap worked well with my 7 month old.We washed the cover prior to use and it held up nicely - no shrinkage, no fading. I was concerned that the velcro parts would become entagled in the washer or dryer, but that was not the case. The pink gingham is really cute.I gave it only 4 stars because it doesn't fold up into a neat bundle after use. We just wad it up and throw it over a shoulder when taking the baby out of the cart.We use this mostly at Target and Whole Foods and haven't had any issues with it fitting the full-size carts. Great product!"
115154,1,"This is my first review. Never left one before, but had to add one here given how frustrating this gate was.It works great, once you get it to work. Before that though, I was ready to pitch it. Whether it closes shut or not was totally inconsistent which, for me, seems to defeat the purpose of a self-closing gate. If you can't be reasonably sure that it's going to close itself, then what's the point in getting a self-closing gate?Anyhow, this is what worked for me.First of all, tension on the bottom tension knobs really doesn't matter, as long as it makes contact with the door frame and is tight. My point is, they'll talk about adjusting the tension on all of the knobs, but the bottom knobs tighten a rigid metal bar. So obviously, there isn't much adjusting to do on the bottom knobs. Either it's tight or it isn't. The only real adjusting is on the top knobs, which opens and closes the upper latch set.Second, for me, the reason why I think this doesn't work is because the silver pin which falls out of the lower latch set and into the hole in the bottom of the frame gets caught on the bottom frame. The bottom frame is a rectangular, metal bar with a rounded plastic molding that the bottom latch set makes contact with. Because the plastic moulding is rounded, the silver pin slides right up and over it, into the hole, which secures the bottom half of the door shut. But, when the pin makes contact with the flat (not rounded) metal bar first, it doesn't slide up. It just hits it and bounces back. I could see this because the paint was wearing away on the metal bar where the pin was hitting it. So, basically, the way the door is designed, the bottom of the door and the lower latch set all swing to low, causing the silver pin to contact the flat bottom frame first instead of the rounded plastic moulding. What I did was I wedged (and taped) some cardboard next to the door hinge between the bottom of the door and the lower door frame. It lifts the door up about a half inch, the pin contacts the plastic molding instead of the metal frame, and the thing works perfect every time. Never misses."
147795,1,"My baby loved this carseat. When she was about 5 weeks old we put her in to sleep at night and she immediately started sleeping through the night. She slept in this carseat, all buckled in, for many weeks (she did finally move to the crib). She thought it was very comfortable!I bought it because of its excellent safety record. I also really liked the colors. The fabric is wonderful- it washes very well and shows no wear. It is very easy to get in and out of the car. It is also easy to rock it on the floor- important for soothing a fussy baby (especially one who sleeps in her carseat at night). I highly recommend this!"
21267,1,I have used this blanket for a while now with my potty training daughter. I had no problem with it like the other reviewer did. Worked great and functioned exactly as I thought it would. Great buy!!
179496,1,"Sturdy. Easy to assemble and to use. Quick release wheels work well, although I never had to remove them at security - it fit through smaller x-ray equipment with wheels on. ( Although few will accommodate the carseat which is almost always hand checked.) I found it easy to secure seat to travelmate with 29 lb child inside. And the first plane I was on was an A320 with aisles wide enough for travelmate and carseat ( Britax Marathon 70) which made sleep time travel so easy. Wheels are large and ride smooth. My only complaint is release strap is not smooth and sometimes sticks. (it works like snowboard bindings , but not as smooth and easy to release)"
38170,0,"We love the mobile but you need to constantly wind it up yourself. The song needs to last longer if you must wind it. Otherwise, we needed to cut a small piece of wood for it to fit correctly on the crib due to the way the screw-on plate is made. The bears are cute though."
137848,1,"We bought the Cloud b Twilight Constellation Lady Bug night light for our little one and I have to say that we're pleased with it. I was kind of surprised that the shell was hard plastic, but that's the result of me not reading through the product description thoroughly enough. The rest of the lady bug is soft plush. The stars are a nice effect at night, although the red setting is only very visible in very dark conditions (the blue and green show up just fine though). The stars (and crescent moon) are stationary and you can make out some constellations in it (a fact pointed out by our 11 year old). It is what it is, a night light that projects stars on the ceiling and walls (seems that some expectations ran a bit higher). The little one really isn't old enough to enjoy it yet, but my wife and I love it and the eleven year old is particularly taken with it (he's asking for his own). If you're looking for a night light with a little more character than something that just plugs into the wall, this is a very cute, functional and relaxing choice."
178380,1,"I haven't actually used the Baby Bjorn carrier but it has been highly recommended to me. I was going to buy a cheaper baby carrier, but after reading other reviews on the internet and talking to people who have this carrier, I decided to pay the little extra to get a good quality product. I found that Amazon was the cheapest place to purchase this carrier ($60)."
61511,1,"PURCHASED THIS BABY MONITOR SO THAT I COULD HEAR THE DOORBELL WHILE I WAS IN OUR OFFICE IN THE BASEMENT AS I HAD MISSED 2 DELIVERIES THAT HAD TO BE SIGNED FOR. THIS MONITOR WORKS GREAT. IT IS VERY SENSITIVE AND EVEN PICKS UP THE SOUND OF AIR COMING THROUGH THE AC/HEAT VENTS. AN ADDED BONUS IS THE CHIME OF THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK TO ALERT ME TO THE TIME. DON'T WANT TO MISS MEALS. I TOLD MY COUSIN ABOUT THIS AND HE IS GETTING ONE FOR HIS BASEMENT MANCAVE. SINCE YOU CAN CARRY IT AROUND, YOU COULD USE IT IN THE GARAGE MOWING, ON THE PATIO OR ANYWHERE WITHIN THE RANGE. FOR THE PRICE, IT IS AN EXCELLENT VALUE. THANK YOU."
42643,1,"I absolutely LOVE my Moby wrap. I am not sure what I would do without it. My baby loves to be close all the time, so getting things done without it would be impossible. Also extremely handy for taking walks outside to calm her down and help her nap, going out to eat at restaurants and not having to keep her in some kind of holder(we have one that stays in the car). My husband also loves to Moby because he is able to hold her and go on the computer at the same time."
153213,1,"This car seat is great. I had the whole Montecito set since my son was born, so when he turned 1 I had to get this. I still love it to this day. It was sooooooo easy to install. Anyone who has problems with it moving (as all car seats do) there are 2 latches to secure it into your car (which i""m sure is in the instruction manual). I only use the top latch if I have that problem. The cup holders are sooo convenient. If you feel that the straps are getting too tight or the bottom buckle is too short even after adjusting the straps, you have to move them to a higher position. There are 3 positions for the straps and 3 for the buckle. My child is 3 and is tall and I am just about to move to the 3rd one actually. The car seat is very roomy compared to others and has a very high back. Also fabric is removable for easy washing. I hope I didn't leave anything out."
154056,1,"I use bladder pads at night to save multiple, painful trips to the restroom. Due to severe arthrtis in my arms/hands I am not always able to bathe using soap & water in the morning when I first get up. Not only are these no fragrance wipes the best I've found to cleanse my skin resulting in no residual odor, they are also gentle to my skin and leave no residue. The size is more than adequate for the job and the price very affordable."
159342,1,"Our 3 month old daughter loves this bouncer. She is so entertained by the kissing fish and the rotating starfish. One of the first times we heard her laugh was when she was in her seat watching them. Her eyes just light up and she always smiles when she is playing in it. She doesn't really like the vibrating feature but she likes to hear the different sounds while she plays..I wish the seat wouldn't turn off so quickly. You have to keep turning it back on after about 5 minutes but other than that, this seat has all the bells and whistles a baby needs"
71111,1,"We bought this at a Baby Superstore on clearance right before Christmas...this is SO great to have! When we bought it my daughter was only 2 1/2 months old and we started using it right away, she loved it then and still loves it at 7 months!What's nice is that the back reclines so they can sleep in it if you're out and about with it. The kickstand is nice to have if you want to walk away (do dishes with them close by, etc.) and not worry about it rocking too forward with a small infant (I used to use this while I took a shower and had her in the room with me - it was a nice piece of mind knowing she couldn't rock herself forward and tip herself over).The toybar is removable too! Though, even at 7 months, my daughter still plays with it...(I do think, though, that some of the toys are a little hard for her to be batting around).We've taken this with us at holidays and it was nice to have to entertain her and let her sleep in (since it reclines and vibrates).My 18 month old nephew even loves it - he knows how to rock it and won't get out of it when we have him over.The ONLY think I would change is to have it collapse to take with you or store in their room (whereever) when not in use."
142938,0,"Our Norwich terrier puppy at less than 10 lbs could wiggle though the gate, now that she's a little bigger she doesn't try that anymore. This gate is not that simple to open but adults get the system after a couple of tries! Suits our needs just fine."
176377,0,"I'm expecting the second child and looking for an electrical pump (before I had a manual one Medela). I don't know what I will choose, but I found this info interesting:Use this web-site to hear the noise of Medela Mini Electric Breast Pump: [...]and compare with Medela Swing Breast Pump: [...]Good luck!"
86237,2,"This monitor has performed very poorly for us. It worked for a couple weeks when we first purchased it (approximately two years ago), then we started to get constant interference with the sound. Even after adjusting anything and everything that could be interfering with the signal, it still didn't work well. We can still hear things but cannot leave the volume on because the interference is so annoying. We never replaced it because we mostly used the video capabilities (which are fine but not fantastic) but a few weeks ago the night vision stopped working. I didn't really care but then my daughter got sick this week and I couldn't see her at night, which was problematic. We will be buying another monitor which will most definitely not be a Summer! This is NOT a monitor I would ever recommend to anyone!"
176258,0,"I bought these as burp cloths for my two boys.As burp cloths they are great - nothing fancy, just good at absorbing the spit up. The fancy burp cloths are usually too flimsy (won't lay flat on your shoulder) and too thin to be helpful. These stay in place without having to touch/fix it.I have tried them for cloth diapering but it seems they don't hold very well and leak more than the other diaper inserts I've used. I usually don't cloth diaper so I can't say too much on this - this is just from the few times I have used it."
166974,1,"I was given this piggy bank as a gift at my baby shower and my daugher loves it. It is ceramic, so I keep it up high out of her reach. When she receives money, I take it down and she puts it in and gives the piggy a kiss. It adds a great touch to her room as well. Very decorative."
183881,1,This is the best price for diapers and the bonus of being delivered to my door.
124178,2,"Please anyone who owns this stroller check all snaps. The snaps on the rear seat broke and left very sharp and jagged metal. While changing my baby she rubbed her arm against the side and ended up with a 3"" gash on her arm gushing blood. That ended our trip at the zoo. I did not know what cut my daughter until I pulled the pad away and received a nice cut myself. I have used this stroller fewer than 20 times. We have been very gentle on it. I did not realize the snaps had broke because I've always covered the seats.I did call Evenflo and they offered a replacement or a refund. I did not need to provide Evenflo with a receipt or other proof of purchase. So hopefully your child will not be injured and you won't be stuck with a dangerous stroller. -refund check was $149-"
128066,1,Received this blanket as a gift and was impressed by its size and quality. It wasn't until we began using it that I truly realized its value! The material is lightweight and strong. Due to its size and the quality of the material it serves its purpose quite well. Very pleased.
126033,1,"If your Huggies diaper is leaking, then you're not putting it on tight enough. After you put on the diaper, check the elastic that wraps around the legs. Put your finger between the elastic and the baby's leg, pulling on it to make sure it's taut. If it's not snug, then you didn't put it on tight enough. Unvelcro the strab, push the top layer down--hold it-- and then pull up the bottom velcro strap, strapping it to the top/front. Also make sure that the front of the diaper is not too high or too low; this is another common error. The newborns are particularly great--I love their liners. People talk about how some diapers shape babies better, but I've used all kinds and they all fit exactly the same. Huggies are also very cheap compared to Pampers. They're about the same price as the K-Mart brand if you shop at Costco or at Amazon when they have a special. And the K-Mart ones WILL leak through because they're thinner; you can feel the heat after a #1 or #2. With Huggies, your baby probably won't be crying due to a wet diaper (at least not after the first time they pee). 4 stars for quality, 5 stars for value-- 5 stars overall. You should at least try a cheaper diaper like Huggies because if it works for you, you'll be saving a lot of money."
70922,1,"I purchased this as one of my 3-month-old daughter's Christmas presents after reading other reviews. So glad I got it--and I think she is as well because she loves sitting in it, where as she didn't care for her bouncer seat. I think she prefers this over the bouncer because she can sit more upright, which will be necessary for when I start feeding her cereal. I also like that it reclines when she falls asleep. Only minor thing I would change is that the little bug on the toy bar is quite loud for little ears."
79694,1,This was requested as a gift for a grandson. The family had an earlier version. The soft side is great to have around children. This new one has an organizer inside that can be removed to carry toys to a vehicle or for an outing. The colors are bright and the box is pretty roomy.
47513,1,"I loved having this co-sleeper for my newborn. It is so nice to be able to reach over and get the baby to nurse without getting out of bed. It is great if you have the baby in bed with you some and want a space for the baby also.Pros:Good size (unless you have a huge baby :) - my baby is now 7 months and 14 lbs and still fits inside just fine.Convenient for night nursingStraps to the bed, so no worries about baby falling between bed and bassinetCons:It is a bit hard to fold down/set up - don't buy it for travelThe sleep area for the baby does not lower (I think the large size one does), so this cannot be used as a playpen or with a baby that can pull upI am really glad we had this, and it is now on loan to another new mom until we have another baby."
76275,1,"I bought these so I could store homemade baby food and I like them a lot. It's a great deal comparing to other baby food freezing trays.I was a little concerned when I read the negative review about:1. how it's hard to get the cubes out2.how the tray cracks easily3. The cover does not fit.Well, these problems are nothing to worry about.First of all, when you get the trays, it says in the manual if the cover does not fit right, submerge it in hot water, then put it on the tray and let cool. This will make sure the cover fit perfectly. I did this since the covers were a bit hard to put on, and it worked out perfectly.Second, like other reviews mentioned, when you are getting the cubes out, you need to run it under hot water for 30 seconds or so, then it's so easy to get them out.This bring the third thing,the trays are hard, not flexible, so you can't twist it to get the cubes out. Like I mentioned, I run the frozen tray under hot water, flip the tray so the cover is at the bottom, then I smash it lightly on the counter top, you could hear the cubes got loosened from the tray. Most importantly, NO CRACKS."
88293,2,"I am an internet shopper. I review everything before I buy it. This diaper bag seemed great after I read the reviews, but IT IS NOT! I don't require a lot of space every day, but I would like to be able to fit 2- outfits (newborn!), burp rags, bibs, and one thin blanket on the inside of my bag, without having to take all the items out to find anything. There are these long shallow pockets across the top. If you put anything in them (paci, tiny motrin bottle, cellphone), then you really can't reach into the bag below, because those top compartments are sticking out into the middle of the bag, trapping the bottom items in the bag. And the main compartment and outside pockets all have velcro, so try getting your outfits and blanket in and out without snagging them. Try putting your own arm down in there, without snagging the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. Impossible! I just absolutely hate this bag. No other way to say it. I have never reviewed anything so negatively on Amazon. Very disappointing. Maybe I can sell it for half of what I paid, so that someone who feels the way the other reviewers do can buy it!"
33245,1,"I wanted a sturdy stair gate that didn't look like jail bars. So when I found this gate, I was very excited. This is a very sturdy astheticly pleasing gate. My son is 10 1/2 months old and extremely active, and he goes over to the gate and pulls himself up and yanks it back and forth. It hasn't popped open to date."
91898,1,My sister recommended this after her daughter went through rounds of doctor visits for severe diaper rash. My son has only had a few cases but the pure zinc oxide takes care of minor redness before it becomes a rash and healed the full-blown diaper rash in less than a week when other ointments weren't even making a dent!! We purchased the 2oz tubes from the grocery store (about $1.50) but I was excited to see there was a larger container available. This stuff works wonders!
55480,1,"I wanted something simple so after looking around in the store my husband and I chose this for our baby registry.For the most part, it works great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because filling the tube with the amount of water ""supposedly"" required isn't entirely accurate. Sometimes we'd put the appropriate water and it wouldn't heat enough. On the other hand, there are times we wait until the unit tells us the unit is warm and it's super HOT! That is defitnely a warning--it doesn't just warm the bottle. Sometimes it really HEATS it up.I just recently also started using the baby food jar warmer attachement and that works great.This product is compact so it won't take up a lot of room (something that was very important to me because I live in an apartment) and cleans very well. The cord, however, is not long at all so you'll have to put it close to the outlet unless you can use an extension cord. It's great for quick fixes though. The bottle does not take long at all to heat whether large or small.A good product. It is durable and I know will last me for other children I may have."
109504,1,"I feel it's important for baby to learn how to eat from a spoon so I only use these feeders as a teething tool, not for regular mealtimes. Chunks of frozen fruit or frozen puree cubes in these little feeders work great for soothing sore gums and also giving baby something that tastes yummy at the same time. My daughter enjoys chunks of frozen bananas (although those are hardest to clean from the mesh). I've also done chunks of cooked and frozen apples, peaches, pears, and even sweet potato. Put a bib on your child, it will be messy.The feeders get 4 stars instead of 5 simply because they're a pain to clean. Bananas especially. They don't come clean in the dishwasher, so don't even try. I've found that soaking in warm soapy water and then scrubbing the mesh gently with a child-size toothbrush works best. Also, the mesh starts to break apart after repeated use, so throw them away and buy new ones when that happens.I believe the Sassy brand feeders have mesh bag replacements available. I'm not sure about the Munchkin.All in all, a good product. The extra effort it takes to clean them is worth it for the relief these provide to a teething baby."
83677,1,"i had nursing issues for a couple weeks after childbirth, mainly getting my daughter to latch on. i opened it up when i got it and she latched right on to the nipple shield, a few moments later after my &#34;let-down&#34; slowed down, i took it off and she latched onto my nipple with ease. i didnt put the nipple shield on my other breast, just to see how she would do without it that time, and she had a lil trouble, but latched on pretty quickly. i literally only used that product for that one night, and she was good to go. that is how this product helped me and my daughter."
13721,1,"This is a great product. I have had (and still have) several 'baby gates', and this is the best one I have ever purchased. All of the others are pressure gates of one sort or another, and this is by far the most attractive and convenient.It is tall enough at 20"" to keep my Yorkie, Terrier mix, Doxie/Corgi mix and Maltese where I want them to stay (even my 45 lb Dingo mix will not cross), but short enough to allow my cats to jump over into areas they are allowed to go. This is also much easier for me to step over (vs. the standard 26"" pressure gate).Simply pick up and move to the location you want it, and you are done. No more fighting with adjusting/readjusting the width to fit every time. No more pinched fingers fiddling with the adjustments.Assembly is easy, though you need to take a moment to analyze 'left' from 'right' on the provided instructions. At $80 it is a little pricey, but for me, the cost was well worth the added convenience.The only downside is, if you do want to adjust the width, it would require partial disassembly/reassembly, or multiple gates, which is not convenient and/or expensive. But, if you have a place you know you want to keep a gate permanently, or use only in a single location, this is the one for you."
37903,0,"Just got the stroller - not really that much to talk about. The locking mechanism for folding/unfolding is a little difficult but other than that, it seems like a great deal for the money you pay."
45783,0,"The good: My 4 month old really enjoys this toy - especially reaching for, pulling on, and kicking at all the animals. It keeps her entertained for a little while when I try to cook, start laundry etc. Nothing is a substitute for play time with Mommy, but Mommies need to get a few things done!The bad: The batteries are very difficult to change. The plastic compartment is made too tight for the standard Duracell AA batteries! It was frustrating. Finally my husband had to wedge the batteries in with great effort.I like being able to wash the mat, but it is a pain to disassemble for washing."
175389,1,"I have made great use of the Galt Playnest since the day it arrived. My daughter is now 9 months old, but we have been using it since she was 6 months. It has been a lifesaver since she can sit in it unaided while learning to sit up on her own, and falling backwards is not an issue. Plus, she doesn't get tired of playing with her toys while she hangs out in the playnest. It is much better than leaving her in an exersaucer or jumping toy for extended periods of time. Everyone who has come to my house and seen it in action has marveled over how ingenious it really is--simple, but smart. The playnest is also light and easy to pack up for travel. Highly recommended to anyone for birth and up. When my daughter starts crawling, it will just be another hurdle for her to play with, and I can see us continuing to use it. Best baby purchase yet in this house."
46150,0,"We were initially very excited by the fact that our 2 month old daughter loved this thing instantly. But upon using it a bit more, we have seen 3 major limitations that we suspect will make it short-lived.1. The cards are very hard to replace without breaking (due to the cheap, stiff nature of their plastic and the small knobs that hold them together).2. It doesn't spin.3. The vertical cards are almost useless, since the baby cannot see them when she is directly beneath the mobile (where baby is most intrigued), and since the vertical and horizontal cards have different hole locations and therefore cannot be swapped with one another. All it would have taken is an extra set of holes in each card (no cost!) to achieve this but the manufacturers missed it entirely.Baby likes it...for now. But we know that overstimulating her with the same images, and ones that don't spin, might be a problem with this mobile."
42398,1,"I decided to buy a Moby after the birth of my second little guy, who is now 6 weeks old. There are only 18 months between my two boys so taking them both grocery shopping and getting errands done was a much bigger chore than having an older child since the oldest still needs to sit in the shopping cart to prevent him from running off! The Moby has been really nice so that I have one in the cart and one on me while I can have my hands, and the cart empty to get stuff done. My youngest really likes it while he's in it. We've only been doing two of the different holds, since he can't hold his head up yet, but I'm looking forward to trying out some of the others. It's also been nice for taking walks while my oldest is in the stroller and eating out at a restaurant with the family.There are two things that make me only give it 4 stars:1. It's hot. You have your own shirt on, the Moby and a hot little infant. It's probably fabulous for the winter but I'm finding it gets really hot when the weather is warmer.2. Even when you have the wrap perfected, once you take the baby out, you have to sort of readjust the wrap again before putting the baby back in, since it's all shifted and is looser. So that can be a pain sometimes when you need to nurse and then want to put the baby back in. They have a certain ""hold"" for nursing, but I haven't had the chance to try it yet."
93573,2,I purchased 2 of these potties to offer my son consistancy at my house and his grandma's house. Both potties leak when he goes. We have tried having him sit forward and slightly back from the guard but nothing has worked. It is very poorly designed and do not recommend this product to anyone.
170782,0,"Well, you have to get these for the Pack and Play. I was disappointed though because they are not a super tight fit! They have to much slack in my opinion. The sheet bunches up when she is sleeping. It doesn't come off, but they need to make it snugger!"
96227,1,"I have owned this car seat carrier for about 3 and a half years. I am an army wife with two small children. My husband has deployed twice to Iraq for more than a year each time. I travel alone frequently since we are stationed 2000 miles from home. My girls are 19 months apart so two car seats are required when traveling with them. On my own, I could not possibly carry two car seats, stroller, two small children, diaper bags full of traveling supplies AND luggage. This Pac Back has been a lifesaver!! I could fit my infants car seat INSIDE of my toddler's car seat and this Pac Back would hold them both on my back!! I might look like a crazy lady with two car seats strapped to my back but it gets the job done! The padding is sufficient enough so that I didn't feel like the straps were digging into my shoulders and the back support helped to make carrying two car seats surprisingly comfortable. I have used this over a dozen times the past few years and it is still in great condition. As long as my kids are in car seats, I will never travel without the Pac Back!"
88079,1,"My six month old has been using this in some form or fashion since he was about one month old. At first it was great for visual stimulation. Then later he began to reach out for the toys...it's also great for tummy time, and now he sits up and reaches for the toys, and/or shimmies his way across the mat. It's wonderful that I can take it apart and easily put it into the laundry also. This is a must-have, and worth every penney!"
149484,1,"best over all price found after checking and searching through over 15 sights, cant beat the free fast shipping either"
11600,0,"I received this item as a shower gift. It worked great. However, cleaning it was unpleasant because we have hard water. I used white vinegar and it helped.The only other problem I had was that the hot water in the base would sometimes bubble up through the vent holes and a few times when I was half asleep, I got drops on my hand.Overall, it warmed bottles very quickly and was easy to use."
2000,1,"The only thing that would make this diaper better would be if it was environmentally friendly.No leakage, seems comfortable, and with Amazon Mom's, it's priced beautifully.Will continue to purchase until the twins are potty trained. =)"
64288,1,I was told to buy this cream from my girlfriend. She used it when she was in Germany and raved about it! I bought it and I use it everyday. It has such a nice scent and really soothes dry skin. It's definitely one of my favorites!
81222,1,"Vegan shampoo is hard to find, and good ones are even harder. My husband has dandruff, so we especially, especially have trouble finding vegan shampoos that work well for him. He loves this one. One bottle usually lasts a couple of months. Love it, love it."
48425,0,"This was a great monitor in the beginning. My daughter is now 17 months old, and the hand held device started having issues with the sound shorting out with the volume dial after about 8 months of use. Quite annoying, but other than that, its a decent monitor. The video screen is great, and works great at night with its night vision on the camera. Its wall mountable, so I hang the camera on the all above my daughters crib so I can see her well at night. I just wish the sound worked better. Sometimes I'll wake in the middle of the night only to find out the sound is off, and I worry if I missed hearing her cry or coughing.. Not sure if anyone else has had the same issues or not. Over all, its an ""ok"" buy.. Just seems slightly cheaply made with how bad it shorts out in sound."
28941,1,My mother bought this chair for me and I use it every other day. I am pregnant with twins and its nice and comfortable. very easy to assemble and less than half the price as compared to baby's r us. I will definetely be using it more once the twins are born.
171725,1,I recommend this to everyone looking for a really good tub. I have no complaints whatsoever and will be ordering another t keep at the grandma's place for use when baby sleeps over there. Very good product and innovative sling concept.
64545,2,"I purchased this item, but when I went to install it, the pieces shown in the instructions and in the pictures were not the same as the pieces included in the box. I tried to make them work, but it was impossible. I returned it thinking that it must have been a mistake, but the second gate I received had the same issue."
42285,1,"Im a first time mom and I don't think i would have survived the first three months without this wrap. I was able to keep my son close, happy, and warm while getting things done around the house. I also use it for long walks (my exercise), mowing the yard, and grocery shopping.This is very comfortable for both my son and me. He is a big boy, and I had to have a c-section. Since his heftiness is more evenly distributed, I can easily wear him for at least two hours without even feeling achy.What I don't like is that it is incredibly long while I'm barely five feet. The ends end up on the floor or ground as I'm putting it on. This is far outweighed by the fact that he is not readily accessible to well-meaning strangers and their germy hands. People don't mess with him because he's on me. (I don't mind people I know touching him, but strangers creep me out.). At least the part that is on the ground is the part that ties around my waist, not a part that is near his face."
104163,0,"The gate did fit the large opening to our living room. However, it is a bit wobbly and shakes pretty wildly when our one year old hangs on it."
62034,0,"I bought these through Amazon Mom for a great price, however there are a few things I wish I had known before making the purchase.First, these run very small. I ordered size 5, and they fit much smaller than a size 5 diaper. My son can wear them, but I have to adjust them because every once in a while one of his cheeks pops out! He is currently wearing size 2T pants, if that's any help as to size.Second, These are NOT resealable like the other brand. Once you open them at the sides, that's it. This may or may not be a deal breaker for you, but I thought it was a big distinction.Otherwise they work as they should and are definitely being sold at a great price."
20160,1,"I have tried several types of bottles for my baby & have found that I like these for a few reasons..#1- I like the shape of the bottle. The Evenflo Comfi bottles have a similar curved shape but the nipples are awful.#2- I like the quick heat up. I use a bottle warmer most of the time & with a hungry baby crying for a bottle, I like that I can quickly heat these bottles up in just a bowl of hot water because of the vented bottom.#3- No bubbles. Unlike the Avent which become filled with bubbles. In fact I will be buying more VentAire bottles next week to replace my Avent & Evenflo bottles!"
70058,1,"This is an incredible monitor. I am one of those parents who does tons of research before I purchase anything and it paid off witht this product. It is super small (no tall antennas), the parent end is wireless (the battery last forever), it is extremely clear (I can hear the kids playing outside) and we have had absolutely no interference (we have cordless phones - Siemens Gigasets). I am purchasing a second one for our summer home. I hope you love this monitor as much as we do."
46082,1,My little one is 2 months old and she loves this mobile. She lays in her crib kicking and cooing at it. Like other posters have mentioned it would be nice if it could spin on it's own but I don't mind spinning it for her.
2989,1,The Little Lizards Crib set gives the room the feel of the rainforest! The comforter is strong and colorful...everything fits great in the crib. I absolutely love the design and colors! This is a great choice for natural wood cribs and blue walls. My baby boy is going to love the colorful rainforest with lizard designs.
107111,1,Assembly was really easy-I'm not even close to handy and I was able to get it together in about 5 minutes.Changing the bags is easy-I don't have a problem getting the diaper champ open-and since it uses regular trash bags there's no need to buy the expensive liners.We've been using this for 14 months and have never had a problem with odor and trust me it's not because my daughters diapers smell like daisies!
90983,1,We love baby dry and keeps our baby dry and we never failed it.. it works greats and fits our baby.

2017,2,"My sister gave us a package of Pampers baby-dry diapers so we decided to try one on a recent diaper change. These diapers are awful! The sticky (not velcro) tabs don't stretch and the diaper doesn't fit as well as Swaddlers and bunch up between the legs. Are these made from recycled paper? Pampers Baby-Dry & LUVS are basically the same diaper since they are both made by Proctor & Gamble and are both bargin brands. Stick with Swaddlers, Cruisers, or Huggies."
126743,1,"Great deal. The diaper size is just as it stated. We were very pleased with these diapers. We got them the next day we ordered them. Thanks ,Amazon!"
171710,1,"I wasn't sure when I was looking at tubs, but I'm glad I got this one. I used the sling for the first 2 weeks to sponge bath my 5 pound preemie, and despite his size, I felt that he was very secure, he stayed put. For those a little nervous about bathing a baby at first, (like my hubby) the sling is adjustable, so you can loosen it add a little more water, and use it for a regular bath. The drain plug warns if the water is too hot, which again is good for the nervous new parent. Now 2 months old, I use the infant, slanted seat side, and it works well for us. the padding reduces slipping. I also like the space to hold clean rinse water or bath supplies. The only thing they may want to add is a hook to hang this to dry, which some have. Otherwise, it's perfect and cheap. Some may be attracted to a few tubs that are bigger, but I think the size is perfect. It's roomy enough but not so big that the baby can ""escape"", or to mane the baby feel insecure. It's also easier to store than those monster tubs, too."
168379,2,"I made the choice to ""subscribe & save"" this item because it claims to be amazon prime eligible. The date it claimed to be shipped was the 15th, but did not show up until the 21st of that month. I went to my subscribe and save items to check that it was listed under amazon prime, but it was not. It had been shipped with standard shipping. I e-mailed customer service to see if they would fix their error, but they said due to the packages size and weight it was not amazon prime eligible. I checked today to make sure that the error was not on my behalf, but this item still claims to be amazon prime eligible. Just wanted to forewarn every one so they won't get jipped like I did. My husband and I had to go to the store and buy more diapers to make up for the time when we expected them to be here, but they were not. So in the end I did not actually save money, I spent more by this ""subscribe and save"" gimmick."
108581,1,"This was the second bed rail we bought. The first was plastic and flexed, not very secure. This was rigid with a strap that goes under the matress, through to the other side for an extra level of safety. Great product!"
172389,2,"OK, this bathtub does do the trick, but there are many many things that just dont work well. The swivel is rough and dosent work while there is weight in it. It is an akward size and shape. It is hard to get my daughter in and out of it, her legs get stuck. I'm taking it back.....it just work for me or my 5 month old."
148046,1,"My son LOVES his bouncy. As a cranky little guy, it was one of the only things that would soothe him to sleep. The vibrations and a steady bounce. Now he enjoys the toy bar and rings. I will keep him happily playing for a 20 minute stretch or so. Fisher Price was great customer service as well, I had a question about the toy bar, and they were wonderful. The only thing I wish were different is the hanging bird. If my son has a very energetic session in the chair, his knee will have a little red rubbed area were he and the bird had an altercation. It fades within minutes, but I would like the bird to be removable. Regardless, It's FIVE Stars for me!"
130189,1,"This is the first time I am writing a review. Every now and then you come across a product that is amazing and this was it. My little one only slept two hours at a time for one month. I tried to get her to sleep for three hours at a time, at 4 weeks, but it did not work, and I was not about to let her ""cry it out.""She was just one of those babies that wanted to be soothed to sleep constantly. One day, I tried using this swing, in order to take a break and get some rest. It was amazing. Within minutes she was asleep. In fact, this swing was basically her crib for three months. While we dont use the swing now (she is 6 months), it was a great transition to help get my baby on a schedule.At three months, she began sleeping 10 hours every night in her crib.My only complaint is that this toy will eat up your batteries and that it needs a little more cushion and support for smaller babies.I understand that this might not work for everyone, but I highly recommend you give it a try if your baby has trouble sleeping."
75936,0,"Part of my breast reconstruction surgery involved removing and transplanting the aureoles and nipples. This has left massive circular stitches scars all around that area. I wanted these silicone things to cover that area so that the scars (some raised) can't be seen through my tee-shirts. The good news is the silicones do cover that area and I don't have to look in the mirror at the disgusting mess my scars are. Also, the silicone covers stay on very well for me and I don't notice they are there. The bad news is that I can see the shape of the silicone covers through my tee-shirts, with and without a bra. I won't be able to wear them under everything I wanted to."
104147,1,This is a great product and well made. Unfortunately it arrived without instructions. So I printed them from the KidCo website. That's when I realized pieces were missing. I returned the gate and received another one within a week. This time the template for aligning the screws was not included. Fortunately I figured it out. The gate works well and looks clean and functional.I would suggest that KidCo pay more attention to what is in the box.
68998,1,"We've tried a lot of different diapers, and the type that fits our children best are the Pampers. We have never had a Pampers leak, except for one time when we changed a diaper really sleep deprived and put it on inside out. I do not recommend putting on a diaper inside out."
54833,1,"When my husband picked out this mobile I thought it looked like a scary acid trip! I wanted the soothing soft and fuzzy one that matched our baby's room. But I agreed to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. From the minute she saw it, our two-month- old kicked and laughed and loved it! She's now 3 1/2 months and now she babbles at it and follows all the movement with her eyes. It does eat batteries, but that's a small price to pay. I haven't had any trouble with it breaking (maybe we just got lucky)."
124933,0,"My baby loves to jump but this jumper is too big for him. He's 7 months and hasn't figured out how to hold on to the straps like the baby in the picture is doing. (I think the jumper is rated for 4+ months. Also he's relatively thinner than a lot of babies, so he wobbles too much in the seat and sometimes looks as if he might get his neck knocked by the stiff metal bar around the edge of the seat. Wish we had bought one that velcro strapped around his body instead - that way it adjusts to the size of the baby."
129739,2,"I purchased a toddler bed that looks just like this one a few years ago for my middle child from a discount store for around $60. I regretted the purchase as the assembly was a bear and the quality of the wood was poor. So this time, I upgraded to a name-brand bed thinking that I would get a better product... not the case! I wish I'd saved $30 and bought a less expensive bed again. In addition, it took Amazon a LONG time to ship the bed to me and when it arrived the box was damaged.It's a super cute bed and is going to work just fine for our needs."
69024,1,"I'm the father of three boys, ages 10, 6 and 3. All three have always been very tall for their age. When my two older sons were still in diapers but approaching the potty-training plateau, we were often distressed to find that the largest size of baby diapers no longer comfortably fit them, which lead to lots of leaks and messes that were not the most fun things to clean up. Luckily, Pampers has now introduced its largest diaper ever, Cruisers Size 7, and big kids (and their parents) are better for it.Size 7 Cruisers are designed to comfortably fit toddlers who are 41 pounds or more, which is the size of an average 4 year old in America. However, my son--who just turned 3 in December--is already 3.5 feet tall and 42 pounds. As my son grew, we quickly purchased a box of these diapers and tried them out. They fit him snugly and comfortably, and there hasn't been one single leak since.Potty training is on the horizon, but we are not rushing it, and Size 7s are great for that reason. Until he decides that he's ready, he'll have a diaper big enough to accomodate him. I only wish this product was introduced earlier, when my two older boys were still in diapers. It would have save us a lot of unpleasant cleanups!"
28576,1,"My hubby is 5'5"" and I'm 5'1"", and neither of us are overweight. Cushions provide ample back and seat support. Most chair seats are too long for our stature, and this glider fits both of us perfectly. Compared to prices of gliders found in-store (easy $200+), the Hoop Glider is economical, easy to set up, comfy and quiet as can be. We plan to upkeep the glider with some greaser to prevent it from squeaking. Can't wait to use it with the baby :)"
147683,1,"No Complaints at all. If you are looking for a SAFE, light weight, comfortable for baby infant seat this is by far a great pick evenmore so if you have a peg perego stroller to go with."
30463,2,"I needed a new tub for baby 5. I bought this one because I have everything else in the rainforest collection and have liked those items. My son weighed 9 and a half pounds at birth. So, from the beginning he was uncomfortable in the tub. I cinched the hammock as tightly as I could, but his little back still hits the dreaded hump! If I don't keep my hand beneath his back, his lower lumbar rests right on it! Have you ever tried to bathe a large, active, slippery baby with one hand? He wrinkles his brow and squirms rather than enjoying the warmth of the water as he should. I have bathed many a baby many a time in my life and would NEVER have thought putting a hard hump would improve a baby tub! I removed the hammock (great idea, bot poorly designed as well), folded a thick hand towel placed over the hump, and used an ordinary baby bath sling. This ""set-up"" has worked much better. No more uncomfortable baby or one handed mama. In short, seek out a baby bath tub without the horrid ""hump""!"
174045,1,"This swing looks great, and my 10 week old daughter is very content when I put her in it. It's also the only place that she will fall asleep, besides my arms."
34894,1,"I think this is an awesome car seat!!! At 7 months old we decided to purchase our daughter a new car seat and we wanted this to be the last . Installing it rear facing was challenging but with a seat designed to last up to 100 pounds we knew it was basically designed for forward facing. I think the five point harness and long straps are GREAT and getting her in and out is a piece of cake. Any competent adult should not have any problem with the harness, it just takes a little while to get use to ( as most things do). I highly recommend this car seat - we are actually going today to purchase 2 more."
135175,1,"I own a lot of strollers for my twin sons ((this one, the duoglider, two small single strollers, and a double umbrella stroller)) and I absolutely LOVE this one!First of all, if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is, which is for jogging, or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain. My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ((and has no complaints)), but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors. The wheels go over almost any surface, including gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, brick, sand, boardwalk anything, I love it. The seats both fully recline ((individually)) and when they do, the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ((although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look)). The five-point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE, and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well. The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block, which is very important to me. It is also removable, but I don't see why it would be advantageous to take it off. Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well, handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks. Considering the type of stroller it is, it folds very easily, and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ((which is equally as easy to do, rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism)). The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed! The breaks are FANTASTIC, and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging, and need to stop quickly, according to my husband anyway. The included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ((can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy, incase there is a chance of rain you don't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet)), but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs.I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn ((although I have kind of gotten it down to a science, you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit, the turn is very wide and not that smooth)). I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ((a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller)), but that's just me personally. The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way, and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ((that's why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches, so I don't have to constantly go into the basket)). The canopy is quite large, and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn't go back neatly, and if its a windy day the canopy doesn't always stay up.If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use, and don't mind the large size or getting used to turning, then I highly recommend the Tike Tech!"
22152,2,"I had really high hopes for these bags as a working mom of an infant, especially since Medella has such great products for pumping. These bags are the third brand I've used and are, by far, the worst.Pros:- They do stand up well, if that is something you think you'll use, and are the most sturdy bag I've seen for that purpose.Cons:- I dislike the feel of the plastic, which is stiff and rigid and has as strong plastic smell.- They don't open well for pouring milk into or out of the bags. There seems to be a fair learning curve at how you should exactly hold the bag and at what angle it needs to be tilted to get it to pour well. I get very frustrated when I lose even one drop of milk, so this is a big one for me, especially considering that multiple people may be handling the milk bags in a given day.- There is only one zipper closure, which makes me concerned about how well they will stay closed.- They don't lay flat to freeze into a nice bricks for storage in the freezer.- They aren't factory sealed on top, so there is no way to be sure if the inside of the bag has been tampered with or is still sanitary.- They don't hold a whole lot of milk. The bags are only marked for 5 oz and even then the bag closes tightly.I won't be purchasing these bags again. For the price, they don't have half the features and useability of other bags. My favorite bags are theSimplisse Breastmilk Storage Bags, 25 Packwhich are on the more expensive side, but give me great peace of mind and are easy to use. I also have used and liked theLansinoh Breast Milk Storage Bags 50-pk.which are a bit flimsy, but I would use them in a heartbeat over the Medellas."
149291,1,"I am so happy my husband convinced me to just buy a pillow! I cannot believe how much of a difference it makes in my sleep and ability to be comfortable. Plus I love that it can be used for several other things, like nursing, using it to keep your upper body more elevated, etc. All those extras are on the insinde of the package, and its just a matter of changing the position of the pillow. Right now I am loving that I can make it hug my body. I am usually a back sleeper so sleeping on my side is still hard to remember. Great price on amazon too."
7489,1,"We did not want a big, bulky stroller. This stroller folds up compactly and was very durable. We loved this stroller. Definately worth the money."
141572,1,"My son is 12 months old and he absolutely loves this walker. He has been scooting for a month now on furniture and pushing our coffee table all around the house. Now he takes his walker everywhere. It's perfect for him. He can pull himself up easily on it, manuever it easily. And he LOVES to turn it around and ply with the front. My only regret is not buying it months ago and getting even more use out of it. I will definitely be buying some as gifts!"
27250,2,"I purchased the letter ""b"" but when I received the package, the ribbon was stapled on upside-down making the letter look like a ""p"". It looks great other than it being upside down. Because of the price, it is not worth sending back and waiting on another one. It would be less hassle to just fix it myself. This is a great product, but I suggest buying it in a store (I think Babies 'R Us sells them) to avoid receiving the wrong letter."
28944,2,"Ordered this chair for my soon-to-arrive first son and put it together today. Much to my dismay, the first step in the instructions did not go to plan! The backrest is to be screwed into the base of the chair, but the sleeve anchors were not installed in the pre-drilled holes, so they wouldn't bite to anything. The fix requires (2) 2"" bolts with nuts, not elegant, but the only thing I can figure will work. I moved forward with attaching the arms to the back and screwing those into the base, but that required significant tweaking as the armrests were poorly assembled and did not line up with the holes. After that, it all came together fine and is comfortable, but the poor quality build is extremely disappointing."
143110,0,"I was so excited when I got it - I set it up immediately even though I was still pregnant with my son. Unfortunately something happened and the arm snapped from the base. Mobile is worthless, but it still plays music. Pretty sad that my son didn't get a chance to appreciate it."
108908,0,"I love bags & having my first baby has given me permission to get even more bags. It is a sickness. Anyway, I have the BOB Revolution stroller (which is awesome) and I just had to have this to go with it. It is great looking, well made (I believe produced by the same folks that make Timbuk2 bags), and works well with the stroller if used according to the instructions. I also liked the removable plastic lining in the main compartment. I liked it enough to not go to the trouble to return it and it will function as a non-diaper bag when my baby grows older.Here's what I don't like & what I would seriously consider before purchasing again:1.It is not recommended to use the bag (nor does it work all that well) while using the optional handle bar console. ?? Duh. This would be nice.2. The bag is very narrow but also very deep. Items in the main compartment have to be stacked on top of one another to make use of the space. Not ideal for organizing freaks.3. Unfortunately if you do this you can't stack too high or there is no hope of using the small square velcro closure, which is the only closure, for the main compartment.4. It is also not recommended and it does not work to use the bag while having the BOB stroller in the fully reclined position for sleeping toddler. What the heck? It is inconvenient to take the bag off, try to cram it under the stroller (the small cargo bin of the BOB is is the only thing I don't like about it) & then recline the seat. Not fun when you are out and about and your baby suddenly gets fussy and needs to sleep.I just had to have the matching bag but if I were to consider buying it again I probably wouldn't. Too bad BOB, you should get some input from moms next time."
137899,1,"My son had gotten to the point where he was afraid of the dark and would NOT go to sleep without a light on. I bought this for him, and it totally eased his fears the FIRST night we had it. It's been lights out at night time ever since!"
24194,1,"Everything about this swing is wonderful. It's just that my daughter doesn't like to swing!I love the pattern, the seat is soft and cozy. The tray flips up and getting baby in and out is very easy. I love the recline feature- my daughter used it on her thrid day at home and her head was just fine. If she falls asleep in it, I can even adjust it to recline and she barely stirs.The little bears for the mobile aren't that wonderful, but my daughter likes to look at them anyway. I like that they can be pushed out of the way, too. A couple times I have taken off the bears and hung something brighter on the arm, and she likes that, too.I would buy this swing again!"
179610,2,"I took the recommendation of a friend and purchased this for a long day of flying alone with my one year old. I am also pregnant, so I wanted the easiest thing possible. Well, this wasn't easy by any means!! It is a GREAT idea, but it is very difficult to assemble alone. The adjustable strap is not user friendly at all and it's so hard to put on with child in car seat. I had to sit my child on the floor of the airport each time I had to put it on. It DID fit through the x-ray machine in ATL thankfully, if I turned it upside down. After getting it assembled and through security, I was proudly strolling it through the airport with tons of people stopping me and asking me about it and telling me how wonderful it was. Then... when I got on the plane, a different story! I turned to go down the aisle and it DID NOT fit! The flight attendants were so annoyed with this thing. They said they wished people wouldn't use them b/c they don't fit down many aisles. So, since I had my arms full, the poor little female flight attendant lifted the whole seat with my baby in it and carried it on for me. I was humiliated. Then, I didn't have room to remove the GOGOKidz as it was too cramped and everyone was getting on the plane. Not to mention my baby was screaming. Then the attachment didn't fit in the overhead bin. So, they had to store it somewhere for me. Luckily, I sat by another mom who had sympathy on me and she was able to help me off the plane after landing since I had a very close connecting flight. The flight attendants basically told me that they were too busy to help me deplane- I think they were too annoyed with the stupid GOGOkidz. The next flight I had to do everything myself. I just took the GOGOKidz off before boarding and carried the seat on and off with baby in it. It was exhausting and not the best idea while pregnant, but I didn't want to hassle anyone else to help me. Bottom line- I would have been okay had my husband was with me, but DO NOT travel with this alone!!!"
56560,2,"These are great to keep our kids from turning on the stove, however the hinge joint is pretty weak and these are easily broken."
166873,1,"This is a good basic sleepsack. You get exactly what you expect. I bought this because my baby was outgrowing swaddling. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase.PROs- Velboa Material is thick enough to stay warm but not too thick- Easy to wash- Easy to zip on and off- My baby is constantly kicking his legs and turning onto his sides, and this sleepsack does not impair his movements.CONs- There is a little bit of pilling after washing, but it is on the inside of the sleep sack and it doesn't bother me too much."
107337,2,"This is a terribly frustrating product. The design has such potential, especially the fact that it uses regular kitchen bags and not some special, expensive inserts like the Diaper Genie.For disposables, which we used the first few weeks with our twins, it works marginally well. We did not encounter any odor issues (they're still young and poop is not too stinky). There is a trick - you need to wrap up the diaper tightly and put the wipe inside, or they get stuck.HOWEVER, it does not work at all with cloth diapers. The diapers invariably get stuck in the lid, almost every single time. It generally works for the first two to three diapers after it's freshly emptied. It's a pain to open up, and then you have to grab onto a wet, dirty diaper to pull it through the mechanism.In addition, the top is more narrow than the bottom, and there are sharp protuberances near the top, resulting in shredded bags when they're removed.I would not recommend this to anyone using cloth diapers. A garbage can with a lid works better, which is what I have now."
10761,0,I have no idea why this product was placed in my account because I have nevered ordered this product EVER! So it wouldn't be fair to give a bad review or a really good review so I gave a middle mark.
17440,1,"We got this for my daughter for Christmas when she was 2 months. She liked laying in it and looking at all the bright colors and toys but she really started to enjoyit when she turned 4 months. She pulls on the toys...laughs at the animals and will entertain herself for a long time! The best part is this is a great toy for practicing sitting becasue anyway she falls she is caught by a soft surface. In fact, my daughter will be 5 months in a week and is already sitting up by herself!! I owe it all to this Playnest!The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is it is a pain to put it together, but not all that bad. I took me 30 minutes with my husband laughing at me. It is also a little big for small areas like my house and hern room. But still way worth it!!"
110458,1,I've tried a number of cabinet latches and found these to be the best and the most flexible. They prevent pinched fingers because the cabinet doors don't open at all. I also used the locks on a desk we have in the living room. I'm not sure why there are so many complaints about the directions - I didn't have any problems with installation.
27713,1,"This double stroller looks to have independent reclining seats, but I need to make sure.Does anyone know for sure?Thanks"
105475,2,"One star is one too many for this piece of crap. The Diaper Champ SUCKS!! I have zero praise to offer. It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands. SAVE YOUR MONEY! You can have mine, it's on the curb waiting for the garbage collectors to come get it."
120978,1,"I put a couple sets of these on my baby registry and am so pleased with them that I have ordered more myself!! I'm very lucky that my daycare humors me and will use them too. I just put soiled ones in a dry bucket (make sure to fold the tabs back). My baby only poos every few days and not a diaper in the world will hold all of that, so don't expect miracles, but it is great for the smaller poos of the first few months and pee thereafter. Recommend washing at least twice before using--for absorbancy. Happy diapering!"
126125,2,"I have been getting the Huggies brand for for over 15 months now, and most of the time, from Amazon. My Daughter is 18 months old, and average height and weight. Just got another box that I ordered via the subscribe and save option, but the diapers are different. The box still says Size 3 snug and dry, and the amount of diapers are the same, but the quality of the diapers are NOT. I received a new box on Thursday and these diapers are not the same as I have been getting!! They are a little thicker throughout the diaper which makes the diaper poof out when wearing. I have noticed that I need to change my daughter's diaper much more often as the are not holding as much urine. The diaper's design has changed, still Mickey and Pluto, but the pictures are bigger than the one's we have been receiving, there is a blue panel on the entire bottom of the diaper as opposed to the regular one's, which only have the blue panel on the outer edges, and in the diaper itself, it is much stiffer in the middle. I still have a few of the regular one's left, and am comparing it to the new box we just received.Not sure I want to reorder again, because of the POOR quality of the newest box of diapers we just received."
1681,1,"My sister had me switch from size 3 to 4 when our son wasn't even 20 lbs. They fit perfectly and have always kept him dry. Baby Dry's in size 4 do have flex/stretch, which is good. They do run smaller than Cruisers (you usually get about 25% more diapers than Cruisers for the same price) and they're a good transition from the too small size 3's into a size 4."
4059,0,"I bought this item as a gift for my grandson's new bed. Sent it to another State and when my daughter tried to put it together, it had two left rails. She brought it back to a near her, but it was not in stock. Unfortunately, she had to settle for another bedrail. She was not pleased."
173911,0,"She loved it for about 1 week and then it was over..It was very nicely made and loved the swinging motion of side to side(as did my daughter) the spinning animals were cute too, but she didnt seem too impressed with it after about a week."
1640,1,"When it comes to diapers, there is really only one major criteria that it has to have in our household: the diaper cannot leak/result in major blowouts. While I know that there are no 100% leak proof/blow out proof diaper out there, the Pampers Baby Dry diapers come pretty close. We have not experienced any leaks with Pampers, as opposed to store brands or Luvs.Our daughter is highly prone to diaper rashes, and with the Pampers Dry Max, we've noticed that her rashes have decreased significantly when wearing these diapers. The diapers absorb so much liquid, and keeps it away from our daughter's skin! The one gripe we have with Pampers is the scent - their diapers are generally heavily perfumed. If your kid makes a big stink, this may not be a bad thing - we just didn't care to smell our daughter before we heard her enter a room (deposit or not!). Outside of that, these diapers are fantastic! Highly recommended!"
53465,1,"We bought this for our 4 month old who loves to sit up, and is just starting to eat cereal...It is the best, we have it attached to the bar all the time, instead of getting one of those bulky highchairs that take up to much room...&#60;br /&#62;From a 1st time Mommy!&#60;br /&#62;"
158806,0,"My baby already stands up so this gets on his way when he awakes up in the crib. The item is nicely made, but I would only use it on younger babies."
120620,0,"I am having twins and my back has been killing me lately. I read so many good reviews about this belt I had high hopes, but I just couldn't wear it for longer than a few hours.Pros: When standing, it does hold the belly up, which did relieve pressure from my back.Cons: Unfortunately there were more cons than pros....first I had to safety pin the top straps to my bra so they didn't show. I thought this could have been designed a little better--even with more modest tops it would show through. Second, I thought the part that goes below your belly should have been a little wider. Whenever I sat down it folded/cut into me. So now instead of a backache I had stomach pain where it would cut into me. I feel if they made it a little wider this wouldn't have happened so easily.So while this belt has a good concept (and I was really really really hoping this would be the answer to my back issues), it is not for everyone."
124896,1,"Was considering buying a more expensive product like a jumperoo, but decided to try the jump up for our grandson. It is simple to use and hang and is quite sturdy. He is really enjoying it and when he grows we will be able to pass it on to someone else!"
176577,1,"We used these with our oldest son now 14 and our daughter 9 we are expecting again in August and have already purchased these for our new son. The only downside is that you have to keep purchasing liners, but the upside is that they are much easier to clean."
10058,0,"I don't remember where I purchased this seat but it was the second one I tried for potty training. The seat is good, nice construction but it did not work on our toilet seat. We have a Bemis brand, easy close elongated seat, the opening is about 10 inch long, just under 8 inches wide, with a curve to the seat, this seat did not work on it at all. We brought it to my in-laws for the kids to use there and it fits no problem. Both my daughter and niece use it at grandmas with no issues.I really wish they would show you pictures of the under side of the seats and the measurements for the minimum opening. After two seats I'm still trying to find one to fit on our toilet."
46259,1,"Purchased this play yard to use in the house for our dog. The dog recently had surgery and had to be confined. I don't own a kennel and was looking for a more versatile option. Upon arrival, opening up the box, I was pleasantly surprise to find the fence was already assembled. One pull on the strap, lifted the entire fence out of the box. I set the fence into the desired shape, put down the dog bed, put the dog in and closed the gate. It was very simple. This set up allows me to fed, water, attend and pet our dog all without opening a cage door.I'll be using it in the future to keep the over excited dog from running over my young nieces and nephews during family events. This way the dog can be in the room with us and not doing any harm, like stealing food from children's hands."
50351,2,"I'm so glad I'm not the one who paid $50 for this pillow! God bless my friend for thinking of me, but I wish her money could have been better spent. She said her daughter loved it, and maybe the Snoogle works well for some women, but after three attempts at using it, I stuffed it in a plastic bag, and there it sits on my bedroom floor to this day. Here are the reasons why:1. It's way too firm. I could not get it to support my tummy from underneath at all; all I could do was try to sort of lean against it, but that didn't offer any support. Same thing with the back ""support"" -- the whole pillow is so firm, it was more of a leaning thing than a support thing.2. Maybe this is more of the same firmness complaint, but I couldn't get used to using the pillow part. It wasn't soft enough to ""mold"" to my head and neck, and I ended up trying to push it far enough to the side that I could use a regular pillow instead.3. The fabric is, as others have said, not very good quality and itches if your bare skin touches it. The farther I've gone in my pregnancy, the more sensitive my skin has gotten; I can't even imagine trying to use it now. Assuming I could stand the pillow itself, I'd have to buy one of the covers (though I don't have one, so I'm not sure of their quality, either) or make one myself.4. The curve is too confining. I felt like I had to curl up all the time. I'm 5'6"" tall, so you can use that as a measurement tool if you like. I just can't stand not being able to stretch out comfortably, and the Snoogle didn't allow me to do it.5. It's H-U-G-E!!! God help you if you're trying to share a less-than-kingsized bed with your spouse or significant other AND this gargantuan thing. There won't be room for the three of you.6. Don't even try to roll this thing over with you. Talk about a wrestling match!Maybe I can recycle the Snoogle into a sort of TV-watching pillow; it's certainly firm enough for that. But it's not something I'd recommend or buy for a friend or family member. The Boppy Wedge is an INFINITELY better buy for the money (see my review of that item), not to mention being a better product overall."
43718,1,"Worked well with the gate, my gate was bought at a yard sale. It fit exactly and I had no problems with any set up or anything. It was simple and easy to use and I would def. recommend this product to others."
40277,1,These are the same diapers being sold at Safeway and Giant for almost twice as much! I wish I had known about the ability to by diapers online with my first child!
183246,1,Love the Bassinett. It is very sturdy and I did a lot of research on this.Very fast service. Love IT!
162522,0,"Maybe if I had more room to sit this tub... or maybe if I had given it another chance, but I really didn't care for this tub.I would have liked to had a little more water, a few less leaks and little more stability.We have moved to the big tub with one of the little elevated bath tub bouncy seats. My 2 1/2 month old likes it much more and I do too!"
174709,0,"I was sent the wrong product 2 times. The drawer that was sent to me was not the one pictured. Amazon was great about returning it but then sent the wrong one again. I kept the 2nd drawer anyways because I was going to paint it white to match our crib. I lightly sanded it, spray painted it white and changed the handles to glass knobs. It turned out great and was the best deal I could find. It is working perfectly for storage. In the image it has wooden knobs and what was sent has pull handles. I had to fill one of the holes with stucko to make it work. For the price I am happy with what I got."
160721,1,"This product does exactly what it's supposed to - keep the crib clean. I also bought it when I was pregnant to use in case my water broke in bed or in the car or any other inconvienent place. Never needed it for that purpose, but it was nice to know it was there just in case. I'm sure I'll buy a couple more when the boys get a little older and the volume of diaper issues increases."
156209,2,The motor on our swing stopped working after 3 weeks. If you look at a lot of reviews online you will see this is a common problem. So beware buying this swing. While it was working my daughter loved it. Now we are on the hunt for an alternative.
55238,0,"This idea and concept is totally awesome. However, the item is just way too bulky and big. I would love to have found one that is smaller and can fit in a smaller toilet area. We did return it and the company was helpful in our return process. Of course, we had to pay for shipping which was $50. This item is expensive but totally worth it if it wasn't so big. We were disappointed."
2117,2,Big mistake buying these diapers. Baby dry technology does not work apparently - got several leaks. Will get Dry Max next time.
177914,0,"I REALLY like this cup. However, I have had it for less than two months and my the soft spout is splitting. My son is just over a year and TOOTHLESS so he didn't bite it apart! I am having a hard time getting any response from the company...I also bought the straw version for my older son and love it. The downside is that the valves on both styles are hard to keep clean and seem rather brittle. Again, no available replacement pieces. I haven't had any problems with leaking as others have complained about. The cup is very durable and effective in keeping beverages cold but the plastic parts seem to be inferior unfortunately..."
87510,1,"Ok I was looking for a stroller that was: light weight, would recline totally back, larger wheels for strolling through grass, large basket and shade and this stroller has all those features. You can get things from the basket in the front or back. The tray is a little higher but the way it is made I can undo one side and lay it to the side if my son wants to see better. He is only 6 months old so I know this won't be a problem forever. I can see using this stroller for a long time. The iPod dock was just an extra and wasn't my buying factor. The speakers are not real loud which I'm sure they did on purpose don't want babies to lose hearing!"
71649,1,"We bought this carrier for our 2-month-old son after trying out various slings and being dissatisfied with the results. Our son prefers to be carried upright, so we needed an upright carrier. We loved the look of the Baby Bjorn, but didn't want to spend that kind of money to have another carrier collecting dust in our baby's closet again. We decided to get the Infantino Eurorider and my wife and I both love it! Our son fell asleep within minutes of putting him in the carrier. He seemed content and very comfortable! It's comfortable and very easy to use. I would recommend this to everyone who has a young baby."
182463,2,"I bought this thinking it would be good for everyday application for my little one's dry skin. The texture is very nice but the fragrance is so strong that after the second application, I decided to give it away. How can companies make such products and recommend for babies? Do they even think before they put it in the market?"
45559,1,"I got this when my baby was 3 months old and she enjoyed just looking at the animals. Then she started to kick and wave and enjoyed seeing the animals swing. Then, all thanks to this toy, she learned to grab the animals and could really shake the whole gym. In each of these stages she stayed amused for quite a while. She stopped being content under the animals when she learned to roll around, because she often would roll into a corner of the mat and couldn't get around the bar. But even at 9 months she still enjoys it every now and then, for shorter periods.The mirror, music, and lights helped prolong the dreaded tummy time. Watching each of 3 flowers light up in sequence distracted her. And she still enjoys the music and plays w/ the off/on switch, (pushing the mat to activate the musice isn't a concept she undertands, nor is it as interesting as the switch.) Batteries last for quite a while w/ moderate use--the set it came w/ lasted me 6 months.My one qualm is that the 10 continuous minutes of Mozart is the same song that has a very repetitive nature at that (I don't know what song it is but it's like an Invention/Canon/Variation for those that know--the same short melody, over and over in slightly different ways.)Regardless, I and my baby have enjoyed and appreciated this versatile and extensive toy and think that others will too. It's more affordable if you consider that this could truly be the only toy your baby plays w/ during the first 6 months, it was for mine (aside from &quot;diaper bag&quot;/travel toys that were gifts anyway.)"
105997,0,"At first I really liked this product. My son is now three months old and the thing is falling apart. In the center tube where the diapers go through, there is some foam lining in the cracks - mine is all coming out.Also, when you change the bag - it is nasty. Sometimes the diapers will get stuck in the tube and you have to manually pull them out. Since there is no twisting of the bag (like the diaper genie) when you open this thing it smells realllly bad.Also...opening it is difficult. I always bend all of my nails back when pulling out on the lever.It's true that it holds the smell though. That's why I gave it three stars.I guess I'm just disappointed because mine is already in need of a replacement and my baby is only 3 months old. I'm going to see if the manufacturer will give me a refund and then I'm getting the diaper genie."
15857,1,"I was originally looking at the BOB Warm Fuzzy to put into my 2009 BOB stroller for these cold months coming, but after seeing this item and reading the reviews I went with the toddler Bundle Me. I am so glad I did!! My 11 month old has plenty of room to kick his feet still and has stayed toasty warm on walks this weekend when temps were in the 40's and 50's. He was obviously wearing appropriate clothes for the weather so this just makes a nice supplement and is no-hassle since it stays put unlike blakets.I read some reviews that mentioned it did not fit well on thier bobs, but I had it in place in less than 5 minutes. As another reviewer mentioned, the top flap of the BOB stroller that connects the hood to the back is velcro and easily comes undone to accomodate the Bundle Me in a secure fashion.Will definitely be using this through the season and for future kids! Highly recommend!"
131090,1,"I love this! My daughter, at age 21 months, loved this seat more than any present in the world. I recieved this as her birthday present, but she was too young for it (14 months.) Now she uses it and her favorite part was when I would dump her business into the toilet and watch it go down the drain and pipe. She'd clap her hands and say &quot;Bye, bye.&quot; She reminds me to pack her potty seat wherever we go."
49543,1,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. EASY TO SET UP. THIS IS THE 2ND ONE I HAVE BOUGHT. I USED A TWIN BED SIZED MATRESS PAD FOR THE FLOOR WHEN USING IT WITH A HARD WOOD FLOOR. IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO JUST SIT THE PLAY YARD ON TOP OF IT. THE BABY WAS ONLY 6 MONTHS OLD AND NOT WALKING YET SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT SLIDING WITH THE PAD.I ALSO USED BUMPER PADS TIED AROUND THE BOTTOM SO HE WON'T BE LAYING AND KICKING AND HURTING HIS FEET. THE PADS ONLY FITS 3 SIDES. NOT THE OPENING GATE. I WILL SAY THAT THE LOCK IS DIFFICULT TO USE IF YOU ARE NOT VERY STRONG.
132676,0,"We registered for this on the advice of the local baby supply store, even though many folks we talked to recommended a Diaper Genie. We were happy with it for the first eight months or so. The one-handed operation was nice, and we got a good month out of a refill. But once our daughter started on solid food, its ability to keep the nursery odor-free was severely compromised.At about the nine-month mark, the little trap door in the top broke on one side, so it would no longer seal tightly, making the odor problem even worse. We had to start taking dirty diapers out to the trash right away, and only using the pail for wet diapers.The trap door finally broke off completely, necessitating a new diaper pail, given that we have another year or so of diapers ahead of us. This time we'll be getting a Diaper Genie."
21963,0,"Ignore the crazy people with a poor review on this because of the quality of this dresser. Of course it's not the nicest, most fancy well built dresser ever made, but for the money it is a very nice dresser. It is exactly what I expected. The finish is very nice, but be careful with it because it can scratch easy. Yes the wood is particle board and pine but what would you expect for the price. The drawers open & close with ease and it all went together fairly easily. Great bang for your buck."
165412,1,"Pampers Baby Dry and Luvs have been our two go-to brands for our active little guy. For Newborn-thru-2, Pampers were definitely our favorites. But once he hit size three, we've gone with both of these numerous times....and about the only thing we can say for sure is we like both better than Huggies!!! We did get one batch of Pampers about 3 months ago where the elastic tabs would sometimes break or come apart, but Pampers to their credit gave us a refund as well as some half-off coupons that we could use at the local Tarzjay! Probably just a random bad batch or something -- no probs on the others.In the end, it really comes down to cost....and if you compare Pampers vs. Luvs, Luvs ends up being a few cents cheaper per diaper. Given the way the Dems and Republicans are ruining the economy, every cent makes a difference. Hence the reason I'm giving Luvs a 5-star and Pampers a 4-star rating -- both are excellent but Luvs are just a little cheaper!"
180880,1,"The gym was spectacular. It was huge. I had already checked out the other baby gyms, very small. My grandbaby will be able to use this one for quite some time. Very happy I bought it."
160585,0,"Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well. It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though. It just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this. My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off! AH! So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on. It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out. He usually only teethes on 1 side too!"
12461,2,"I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion. I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me. Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!"
57293,1,I boughth this fo rmy boys- they love it! Always pick up their clothes now! Really easy to carry up and down stairs with laundry in it for me and the boys- and you can zip the lid to avoid clothes falling out.
28207,1,I've ordered this product 2 times now and just placed an order for 2 more. This bubble bath makes a nice amount of bubbles and isn't drying to the skin. I have a 3 year old daughter and we haven't had any issues with infections or irritation with this bubble bath. We tried Cali baby and Burts Bees and didn't like either of those at all. Little Twig gets my vote for the best bubble bath!! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not five is the price. $15 for bubble bath is a bit much.
56304,1,"This tray was great for our 16 hour journey to Disney World. My 5 year old loves to color and this was perfect for her to be able to do that in the car. My only issue with it is that it sucks when she did'nt want it on anymore; and then later wanted it back. Very hard to do from the front seat. Otherwise-I'm sure we will be using this for a long time to come on more of our trips. Great for when it was time to eat as well, and there's a nice cup holder for a drink! I wish I would have bought this tray a long time ago!"
109766,1,I'm a huge Snoopy fan - but wasn't thrilled with all of the pastel sets that are available. I LOVE the colors in this set! Our baby giggles at the Snoopy's peeking at him from the bumper pads.
81843,2,"This is the worst pump I have ever used. It did not pump properly, it would take me 10-15 minutes to get 1-2 oz with the product on high. Also it made me very sore. If you want a pump in this price range buy the Evenflo Comfort Select. I also used the Medela single deluxe Battery/electric pump. The Evenflo and Medela worked similarly, the medela was a bit smoother.I am disappointed that Babyrus even offers this product. They are supposed to be the specialty store in baby products, and they are selling such a bad product."
56476,1,"I am no longer worried that my infant touches those buttons. They are easy to handle, resistant to heat, and look...well, alien-like on my stove. :)I recommend them."
11615,1,"As soon as my 5.5 month old starting sitting up without any support, i knew we were ready to move on from her infant sling tub, but not quite ready, to just put her in the tub. This tub allows her the freedom of being in the tub, but with the safety of an infant sling. She has plenty of room to move around and play in there, and if she slips and falls to the side, the inflated tub more than softens her fall. Its easy to wash her hair too - I just put her head back on the tub and wash it there. She loves it and so do I! I have a feeling we will use this tub at least for 6 months or so..."
55748,2,"Water vial is a pain to accurately fillIt does not consistantly heat up the firmula, despite using the proper amount of water"
4781,1,My baby has not had any diaper rash problems since we switched to seventh generation. I highly recommend this product!!!
8680,0,"These are easy to put on and take off. They work well to connect two umbrella strollers. The rubber inserts do fall out easily, so I can tell these may not last long. They only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers. I use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and I connect in 4 places instead of 3 for a sturdier connection."
166904,1,"This is really a great product. I had never heaqrd of Velboa but bought it based on the reviews on this site. It was definitely a good buy. It is soft, even after several washing. I havent found pilling either inside or out. In the summer I put the baby to sleep in it in just a long sleeve cotton onesie. Once it statrted getting colder, she sleeps in her footed pajamas. The sleep sack keeps her warm but not overheated."
86676,2,I washed the bumper part of the basket by hand in cold water and now it does not fit properly. It is way too small and the walls buckle in... this could suffocate my baby... I do not recommend this product at all.
20589,1,"In brief, the Deluxe Jumperoo is BRILLIANT. It epitomizes why Fisher-Price has been the best-selling US toymaker for a jillion years: it's bright, efficient, durable, fun, adjustable, portable and cleanable.There's absolutely nothing educational about the Jumperoo, and that's perhaps one of its best features -- a ride in it is nothing more than pure joy. Since I popped my daughter in one at the store at 4 1/2 months, she's been a bouncin' fool; early on, we put an upside-down bathmat under it so her little feet could grip something, and now as she's grown into it, it's even more fun. The athleticism it encourages is impressive, and her leg strength has been exponentially improved after all the hours of leaping and bouncing (sometimes for so long she's actually bounced herself to sleep in it!).One caveat: if you haven't already, invest in rechargeable batteries! I've replaced hers countless times in the last 3 months, and can't imagine having to keep paying for alkalines. Even though the lights and music are just nice side-effects for a fabulous toy, we never get tired of the happy ""boingboingboing"" sounds..."
15405,1,"We live in MN, and it is very cold here in the winter. I dress my baby in a long sleeved onsie, fleece Pj's and then put her in the fleece lullabag and she stays warm all night. I have never worried about the lullabag covering her face like I would with a blanket. It is important to remember to purchase the fleece lullabag for cool/cold climates and the cotton lullabag for warmer climates. Night time Diaper changes are super easy as there is zipper access at the bottom of the bag. This product also helped with bedtime routine as just the feel/smell of it helped her to know it is bed time. I HIGHLY recommend this product."
74834,1,"Really like this gate. Bought it after reading other good reviews. I orginially purchased it because of how far it extends and its low cost. I wanted to put it in the fireplace/mantel opening to keep my baby out of the fireplace, BUT she figured out how to push the sliding mirror closet doors off the tracks in her bedroom, so now the gate is ""stuck"" in the frame in front of the sliding doors. It keeps her out of the closet and from pushing the doors off and hurting herself AND I can still get in her closet. I am considering buying another one. It was easy to assemble and install. I did use a pair of pliers to tighten the ""knobs"" a bit as it was difficult for me to do it by hand and it was hard to reach and turn the knob closest to the floor just with my fingers. Definitely recommend this gate. I also tried it in our hall where the walls are uneven and it worked great there too!"
153643,2,"I have to stuggle to raise and lower this high chair. It does look great in my kitchen--but, the fabric seat gets dirty so quick. one big mouth wipe against the side and i am working on taking the thing apart & off to wash.(New mothers certainly do not have this sort of extra time!) i assume having the pad washed this much will fade and look worn soon. THe wheels do not help roll the chair around..it seems more like sliding even when the little brakes are off. And, lastly...the tray doesnt seem too sturdy when attached. There are better ones out there for a better price! P>S the dishwasher safe trays do not fit in any normal size dishwasher!"
39838,0,"Pros: Small, very portable, fairly long battery life, outlet available, several different sounds to choose from, and a fairly reasonable price.Cons: Sounds level is quite low on most sounds, however the ocean setting gets very loud. My daughter prefers the brook sound and it does not get very loud at all.I was happy enough with this until we started playing CDs of white noise for our daughter in the car and around the house. They work much better and now I wish we would have just gotten a small CD player to use in her room. I recommend the CD Waterfalls: Sounds of the Earth, it works like magic! I also got For Crying Out Loud and Transitions but they are very hit or miss. The waterfall works 95% of the time in the house or the car, she will calm down and be asleep in seconds, literally. Even when screaming at 100% capacity."
83079,1,"This is a very pretty bassinet skirt and hood. I like it very much. It fits beautifully. HOWEVER, there is nothing embossed OR damask about it. The description is misleading. It is simply a white cotton skirt and liner with a stretchy smocking that enables the skirt to fit so well. The bow is velcro'd onto the front of the skirt and hangs loosely which looks very tacky. I will be sewing it on permanently so that it stays straight. Overall I am happy with it. But I believe the description should be rewritten."
80877,1,This hamper has been great so far and looks wonderful in the nursery. No paint has chipped off and it is pretty sturdy. I'm giving it 4 stars because the liner is difficult to put on and take off.
65097,1,"We did some research before deciding on the Britax Roundabout Convertible car seat and we are so glad we did because we love it! Our toddler was getting too tall for her infant seat, but hadn't hit the weight requirement for facing forward. The Roundabout is wonderful because she can still face backwards for safety. It is very easy to install and adjust and it feels incredibly secure. We use the LATCH system as well as the tether and it really doesn't move at all. It also isn't as big as the Britax Marathon which is great because I have a small car. We are thrilled with this purchase!"
81049,1,I love it! Can't go out without it. My daughter is too young to sit on the toilet without a training potty and this fits perfectly in my purse. Not to mention the handy bag it comes in so you dont have to walk thru a resteraunt with an obvious potty in your hands. I highly recommend it.
30255,1,"Potty Monkey has been a great asset in the potty process, it is a very simple toy but seems to have helped our daughter at least grasp the concept of potty. It is also really cute!"
39337,2,"I chose these blankets for the very cute pattern assortment to make a cover for my changing table pad. When I openned the package at home I discovered that while they are supposed to be 30""x30"" they are really smaller than that. Too small to use for my intended purpose. I have not washed them yet so I don't know if they shrink or how they hold up. They seem a little thinner than other receiving blankets that I have used with my 3 older children.Here I am 1 year later. The blankets have held up in the wash very well and become softer with each washing. Although I did not use them for swaddling, I used a similar set of flannel blankets. The thinness that I complained about actually is a benefit when you are swaddling a baby in hotter weather. A too thick blanket leaves you with a hot and sweaty baby. I didn't swaddle my older kids (it wasn't in vogue 12 years ago), so I didn't know. The only way we got this one to sleep was to swaddle him very tightly."
86704,0,"I bought 2 of these as my family and I were going on a ""nice"" airplane ride. We have 4 children under the age of 4, and these were purchased to help carry our luggage, car seats, carryons, etc(which there were many of them). We were probably using them with items that were too heavy, but I was still surprised at how poorly they held up. The first one broke before we were even on the first plane. The second one ended up working until we had gotten home. I'm sure it would be very nice to use for shopping bags, maybe a light diaper bag - but if you're looking for something heavy-duty this isn't for you!"
9393,0,"I bought this product but ended up sending it back because it didn't have a lid. My son loves saying ""bye,bye pee pee"" and shuting the lid so this wasn't the one for him. I ended up buying the primo seat which is a multi-use seat. The seat comes out and can go on the big toilet, it has handles and you can use the potty for a stool. My son uses it to brush his teeth and to get up to the big potty."
70936,1,It worked good as the infant seat and my son liked the things that hang down but now he is 16 mths old and he loves it as a chair. My only thing is that is still reclines a lot so it is not a very good chair...it makes me feel like its a bit of a gimmick. If there is another one you like but it doesn't convert into a chair...I would get it because this is just not too functional as a chair for a toddler but a great infant rocker
45039,1,"Our baby, now six months old, has been using this play gym since he was three months old. He has gone from watching the dangling toys to batting at them, pulling on them, and chewing them. He has spent hours moving and staring into the baby-safe mirror. Now that he is sitting up, rolling, and starting to try to crawl, he is grasping and removing the toys and pulling on the overhead arches. This activity gym is well designed to encourage the baby's play at different developmental stages! We've also had success using it while traveling by car and plane -- it helps create a familiar play space in a family member's house or hotel room. One caveat: At 3 months old, the simple rattle was our baby's favorite. However, at about 4 months old, when he was starting to put objects in his mouth, it got wedged in his mouth, which frightened him -- No harm was done, but we threw it away."
106940,1,"We have used ours for a year now. And its an overall good product. But when your baby starts eating solids at about 6mth, the poopy diapers get really stinky and even the diaper champ cannot stop these nasty smells from seeping out. We now have a carbon filtered fan to get rid on the smell of dirty diapers in addition to the diaper champ."
180250,1,"I bought the Avent Isis pump before my child was born... It had so many positive reviews that I thought it's popularity must be a sign of its functionality... But I was wrong. I ended up buying the Medela Harmony manual pump by the third week. It is FAR superior!And it is cheaper! Plus it works with many bottle systems. Clearly Avent spends far more on marketing and product placement while the Medela Harmony focuses on being a great product.Isis vs HarmonyIsis is creeky, awkward and leaky... a third of the milk would pour out onto my lap. Also, as another reviewer noted, you have to contort into an awkward forward crunch position to get the milk inside the pump. I soooo wish I had the Harmony when my milk came in. Using the Isis with my engorged breasts was HORRIBLE! So painful and uncomfortable!The harmony doesn't leak at all, is easy to pump, is totally silent and best yet... works with most bottles.It is a great low investment hand pump for moms who are only pumping once or twice a day - not intended for going back to work and making vast stores of milk in the freezer. Get an electric for that. But this is tidy and small - great for trips and diaper bag etc. I was completely satisfied."
138314,1,"Hi Everyone,I rarely write reviews. But every night when we go to bed and my 3yr old son calls for it (we have given it a cute little name) it always reminds me to write for all those parents whose kids cuddle in the bed with them listening to stories and talk to them while they go to sleep. He plays with all the three lights for a while and kiss,hug and talk to it before he falls asleep. At times me and my wife talk for a while in the colorful ambiance (she likes the blue and I love the amber) and often remember the days when we were kids. We have been using it every night since we got it, its just become an integral part of our bedroom and gets lost between our pillows and comforters almost every day. My boy is growing up now and he gets bored very soon with every new toy he gets. But there is something about this I should say, some kind of bonding he has developed with this turtle that he wants it every night he goes to bed.Its about 22 usd, give it a try u won't regret it, otherwise amazon is a reliable place u can very well return it. I have still to use the illustrated constellation guide to teach my lil one something. Have a look at this you tube link to know more about this.[...]"
20787,1,These definitely do their job! I use them more than the 20 times indicated and I don't think that's a problem. Just be careful of the steam when you open it and be sure to use tongs to take out the items - don't reach in!
72440,1,I bought this product to serve two purposes. To reduce sliding of the the carseat on my leather seats and to protect my leather seat from the car seat. It has done both! Plan on buying one for our other truck.
6920,1,Good diapers but can't tell much difference comparing to Baby Dry.
116097,1,"Functional, easy to clean high chair. Well built and looks great in our kitchen. I would recommend this to all parents."
77682,1,"This Chair is very sturdy, I have no fears of my baby falling. She started using it before 6 months and before she could sit unassisted. She is happy there for feedings and likes being part of the family. It wipes clean quickly and easily. It was also sent quickly as I wanted it to arrive before Christmas. So glad I bought this instead of a highchair!"
179205,2,"These bottles suck! A complete waste of money, maybe my daughter will use them to play with her dolls years down the road. They are a HUGE pain to use. For one you can't use a bottle warmer (the water seeps up into bottle). We had to hold it under running water which takes forever. It took my daughter FOREVER to drink the bottle from the nipples. If you are concerned about gas use Dr. Brown's bottles, they have more parts but easy to put together."
161966,2,"The 1 time I buy something (in hte store) without reading reviews and look what I get-a flood. forget about closing it to save a couple inches, you could break your thumb pushing the tab-otherwise it's great... oh, don't let the sling cool down-unless you like that look in a baby's eyes."
184790,1,I love this pack n' play. It have two pack n'plays. This one is much bigger than the regular pack n' play but I still only put one toddler in it. It is sturdy but folds up to not much larger than a single pack n' play.
37089,1,Sturdy gate. Auto-close feature works well - just need to make sure it is not opened too wide to trigger lock in open position.
178848,1,"LOVE IT- This was the best gift ever and I plan to get one for my brother. My husband and I still both enjoy carrying our 8 month old son in this. He is teething now and it is really the only thing that soothes him. Some friends have had back aches with it, but you really need to follow directions for where x-on back should be. I had to keep trying before it really felt comfy. Moms you will feel so close to your baby when he is in this and I don't think you need the more expensive one or longer strap. I am an XL right now and it still fits great!"
102017,2,"BEWARE: Our Baby Trend Pack-N-Play was the model similar to this one (8178BC to be specific) and the rails collapsed on 3 different occasions and the center floor popped up twice (you could see visual damage underneath) and when we paid to send it in for repair the repair dept. sent it back w/ no explanation or letter, and when I got a hold of them, Jeff stated that it was fine. When I questioned why it was returned to us unrepaired he said the damage wasn't there when they inspected it, so of course it was my word against his that it had been damaged when I originally sent it in. What really bothered me is that bottom line I didn't ask them to replace or fix it for free, but I expected them to thoroughly inspect and repair it since I sent I took the time and $ to send it in. I was very alarmed that they didn't take advantage of the opportunity to examine a pack-n-play that had been used by an actual baby and make sure that it was NOT sent back out for use in this unsafe condition. It just proves their lack of concern for their products and the welfare of the children that use them."
34169,1,"This is the BEST carseat carrier! I bought one with wheels first, and while it's nice to be able to roll it, it didn't last long with the way they throw your luggage around (and you're already probably rolling your other luggage!) This carrier is carried on your back and it's VERY comfortable. In fact, I loved this one so much I bought a second one for my 2nd child's carseat."
126690,1,"Love Huggies and getting through Amazon with subscribe and save, best deal, can't be beat! My baby never gets a rash."
160566,1,"My son is almost 11 weeks old and he's been sleeping in his crib since he was 4 weeks. The Ultimate Crib Sheet has been wonderful! For a while we couldn't keep him from peeing out his diaper. He's a side sleeper so he would end up being soaked on one side, along with the blanket he was swaddled in and the crib sheet. It's so convenient just to un-snap the Ultimate Crib Sheet and throw it in the wash! It cleaned up beautifully. We usually let it air dry instead of putting in the dryer, just in case, and then just snap it back on. I bought two so I can interchange them. Good purchase!"
71194,1,"Colorful and comfortable, this rocker is a real mom's helper. It has the ability to be rocked to and fro like a swing or vibrate in a steady position. The dangling toys are pretty enchanting to the little ones, and the middle one sings when pulled. The seat cover is removable and washes really well."
64335,1,"We bought this the spring of 2010, after signing our family up for some charity 5k walks/runs. Strollers and wagons, while practical for many uses- take up WAY too much space when participating in these type events so we bought this lightweight frame carrier. After the first walk we decided we'd never go back to a stroller again. I was elated to be able to take our baby WITH us on family hikes instead of having to get a sitter to watch the baby while we took all our other children. I began using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old and she is 20 months now and it has taken the place of the stroller in our van. We don't use a stroller anymore at all- I love that our daughter can see what we see- and get a real birds eye view.My favorite features:LightweightSun/weather shieldcomfortable strapscell phone pocketdiaper/wipe pocket on the pack"
55250,1,"Although this product is somewhat expensive is is well worth its price in that it is well made, sturdy, not terrible heavy, stable, really easy to put together and very easy for a child to use. Although we bought our son a little potty as well as this product and an integrated child's toilet seat (to see what he preferred to use), once he realized that he could get up onto the regular toilet by himself, and realized that he would feel secure in sitting and getting on and off his toilet seat, he immediately abandoned the litte potty and started using the toilet. This product has saved us a lot of worry, all of the cleaning associated with a little potty seat, and it has given our son great confidence. We love it!"
86650,2,"I bought one moses basket, and then had to order another one due to a quality defect, and they both ended up getting returned. On the side of the basket, where the handles are located, the basket was either poorly wrapped or wasn't wrapped at all and the sharp basket material stuck out. I was bummed that I had to pay for shipping for both items and then had to return them as well. I really liked the idea of having a removable top piece but I would shop around for other baskets before purchasing this one."
177162,1,I choose to buy this from Amazon because I was'nt able to find the 'Creamy' Baby Oil in store. I had to pay for delivery and wait a little while but it was worth all the fuss.The Creamy Baby oil is more effective than the regular Johnsons Baby Oil both for the winter as well as the summer. It moisturises and soothes.
107012,1,"I was going to get the Diaper Genie which I had with my daughter but saw the Diaper Champ and the store. A lady walking by stopped and recommended it to me. I put it on my registry and received it. I love it. The chute will get dirty if you have anything dirty going in it but if you can not fold a dirty diaper up, just wrap a baby wipe around it before sending it into the Champ. I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great. All you need is a Philips screw driver. I got the handle apart and was able to see what makes this wonderful pail work. I filled it with Bleach and water and hosed it off in the yard with the water hose. I then sprayed it down with Lysol and let it dry upside down on a towel. The only smells I have are the ones in the room from changing the diaper. Once I get rid of the diaper in the Champ and a few minutes go by, the room is back to it's regular smell. To fit as many diapers as possible in it I fold them up real tight before putting them into the Champ and I shake the pail a little so they are spread out in the bag. I really love this pail!"
124628,0,"Very pretty but really long and only 3 sided . So I have to hide one side of the crib,also because its too long the cats have a tenancy to play with it."
78951,1,"Since I knew we'd only be flying a couple of times before my daughter outgrew her carseat, I bought this rather than the $100 alternative. We have now made those plane trips, and it really did make taking the carseat easy. I should note that my daughter is big enough to walk and pull her own little suitcase, I did not attempt to have her ride through the airport on the carseat!"
133377,2,"Awful. The people that are saying these dont leak are talking about the bottle itself not leaking from the neck, us with older babies that hold their bottle and throw an shake and hold upside down--- these are the worst. Like a faucet dripping. Ill stick to my $5 nuby no drips"
58039,0,Doesn't bother our 8 month old but it really bugs us! We only put water in it for now but I will never use it for milk or juice because I don't want to clean up a sticky mess!
130081,1,LOVE IT! LOVE IT! JUST LOVE IT! FIRST TIME MOM LIFE SAVER. BEST MONEY SPENT. I GOT IT WHEN GIANNA WAS ONE MONTH. SHE LOVED IT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I GOT HER IN IT AND SEVEN MONTHS LATER SHE STILL DOES.
170216,1,"Fits in your kitchen sink for the first several months. Baby stays put and it contours the baby's body. You really do not need anything else. There are no bells and whistles, but it is truly a useful bathing product. I will use it for #3..."
93117,1,Every place I take this item someone else asks where they can get one. It is perfect for my 3 yr old and she loves to sleep there. It is a great deal and quality for the price.
103572,1,"We have this seat and love it! The tray is great because you don't have to remove it every time you take the baby out. If you have a Houdini toddler like I do, you will love the fact that you don't have to worry about taking your eyes off the baby to look for a place to put the tray. The entire seat can be taken apart and put in the dishwasher, which is great since my son makes quite a mess in it. The seat can be raised and lowered 3 levels as he grows so we get our money's worth."
76577,1,This kit has a good assortment of first aid materials. The little stickers are great for kids and I bought this one because they can re-use the container as a toy when we are done using it.
93268,2,"I had the perception that this cot had a soft type matress as the sleeping surface. It does not! The center pulls up so it is extremely uncomfortable and wavy. I purchased for a day bed for children, and have to put layers of sleeping bags on top to make it suitable to take a nap on. Very disappointed. They really need to invent a small tramp just like this...that seems to be the only thing the children want to do with it.... as it is...."
97751,2,"I did not like these bottles at all. You cannot use a sterilizer or a bottle warmer with them. (Of course, it doesn't say that on the outside of the package--you have to buy them and open them to find that out!) When I would warm them in a glass of water, it was impossible to get them completely dry at the bottom, and the water would leak all over the baby. They were hard to clean. The nipples were also awful. My son would suck like crazy and get very little liquid out of them. We switched to the Evenflo Comfi bottles, which were much cheaper to buy and a whole lot easier to use. My son does not have a lot of gas with them."
181845,0,"This bag is nice and has lots of pockets but inside those pockets are other netted pockets but they are deep (small stuff will slide down into the bottom of them). I wish there was another small (more shallow) pocket/pouch on the insides of these pockets. I also wish the changing pad was able to be folded to a smaller size and maybe had a velcro strap to keep it folded and compact until needed. Also, it would be nice to have a spot (like the wipes) for the changing pad too. Like I said before, the two netted pockets on the inside of the first two pockets are deep but not wide enough to be used for holding diapers... which would have been nice. They are just a smidge too narrow to hold pull-up size diapers. Plus, if the netted pouch was a little looser, then it would be perfect for holding diapers... for even two kids! Lastly, the biggest thing that I found with this bag, it doesn't have enough structure to hold shape unless filled... especially the bottom base of it. I had to use cardboard to make a stronger base to keep it sitting upwards and not allow it to collapse. I am not sure why it was not structured to have more ""strength"" to it.I am happy that this is a backpack version and do like some parts of the bag (wipes holder, bottle slots on sides, light insight material), but to make this bag perfect, it would have some of the things I noted above."
99233,1,"I'm so happy Amazon finally offers subscribe and save to Pampers. Now I can get the best diapers at the best price, and it's so convenient!"
118573,2,"I thought this was like the one I had for my children 25 years ago. wrong!! I thought it was advertised as stainless steel cutting blades, like my old one . well the blade was steel but the strainer part was plastic!! did not work well at all .Would not recommend this product."
13459,1,Plenty of space for bulky plugs...ample room for just about any spike strip I'd imagine. Bought it to keep my 20month old from playing with his cord friends. I'd recommend it for others.
142886,1,it works perfect at the end of the stairs to keep the dogs from going upstairs. The walk though door is perfect. The only thing that was a little difficult was tring to put it together without looking at the instructions. After reading the instructions it went together easy. All and all it is a great product.
134505,2,"We bought this at Babies R Us and are not impressed. The wipes are warm, but the opening in the top is so big that a whole string of wipes come out at one time, making it impossible to keep one hand on baby while reaching for the wipes. The opening should be smaller so the wipes SEPARATE while pulling them through the top opening. If I wasn't so used to it by now, I'd just use electrical tape to cover part of the hole so only one came out at a time.(Would change it to ""***"" or ""****"" if I could after 6mo. of use.)And two years later..... just adding to this review here at 28 months... the top does not stay shut sometimes. This isn't new. We had this with the first one and I exchangeded it to Toys R Us at the time. After many months of use, the darn latch STILL was not working, so I called the company. They were REALLY GREAT and sent me a new lid at no cost to me. Guess what? Same problem. The lids just don't latch well for some reason! I deal with it when it occasionally happens. I have no idea what makes this happen (humidity? heat/cold?) but I stand there and hit close, close, close, close, close until it shuts. Sometimes if you shove a wipe in the latch it helps close it, or at least un-jam it. Very wierd. Maybe I have a wipes warmer ghost, but I have had problems with their lids from day one."
104954,1,"If you want organic and natural..........Dr. Bronner - Organic Citrus Bar Soap, 5 oz bar soap.....They are a good line of products!~"
133321,1,"We originally tried glass bottles with our daughter but she couldn't handle the nipples. We've been using these for the past month and a half and they are working out great. No problems with gas or latching and just love that they're bisphenol-A free.There have been a few nipple-collapsing incidents. Have found that if I loosen the nipple ring ever so slightly, it allows more air into the vent system and the problem is solved.The only down side to these is that there are so many parts (nipple, nipple ring, 2 for the vent system, and the bottle). Lots to clean and one-handed assembly is almost impossible."
101105,1,Much cheaper than the store and the pampers came in a timely manner. Thanks
37598,2,I just think that everyone should know that you can get a box of six refill bags with 72 wipes in each bag at walmart for nine dollars and some change.
125816,1,"These things are great! My 2 1/2 year old is pretty much 100% potty trained during the day, but at night, he pees like a fountain during his sleep! The regular Huggies Pull-ups and the Pampers Easy-ups would leak every single night. I'd have to wash the sheets EVERY DAY. And sometimes he's wake up in the middle of the night screaming ""Help me! All wet!!"" and I'd have to change the sheets & his pull-up during the night. But I did not want to put him back in regular diapers at night.Finally, I saw this new product and ordered immediately. I'm glad I did, because we have not had any leaks at all since we've been using these for overnights. My son loves the Buzz lightyear design and he can easily take them off himself in the morning. Best of all, I no longer have to wash the sheets every day, or change wet clothing anymore because his clothes & the sheets stay dry ALL night.These are extremely absorbant. Somebody has needed to make this product for a long time! Way to go Huggies!!!"
175916,0,"The negative is that the only position that you can use from birth is called the cradle position and my son cried every time I put him in that position. His neck would always turn in an awkward position no matter how I adjusted the carrier. I even followed the manufacturers suggestions of walking around immediately as the motion will soothe him. But after 3 minutes of strait escalating crying I had to remove him.The positive is that my son likes the position in which he is dangling from me facing forward. At this point(3 months old) he can hold his head up without assistance-which is required for this position and most others-, but not his back. I have not yet tried other positions because they require him to be able to keep his back strait on his own also. When in this position (explorer position?) he likes to look about, even fell asleep once. I have my hands free which is a definite plus.Another plus is that the manufacturers are very prompt at responding to email. I even called to get help with the cradle position and the person I spoke to was very helpful (to no avail).I wish I could have used it from birth, though."
138797,1,I was looking for something to help my 2 year daughter feel comfortable sleeping in her own room. We currently use a night light but I thought it would be fun to have something else. My daughter loved this lady bug. She loves being able to choose the color and looking at the stars helps her relax. The only thing missing is the ability to play lullaby's
97756,1,"I have to disagree with the negative reviews, because of these reasons. My son had severe gas from the day he was born - two hours sometimes. The gas medicine worked, but not enough. I had received every type of bottle at my shower, but there were problems with all of them for ""my son"". He preferred a smaller nipple like he was given at the hospital. Avent bottles the nipples were to long, big and he would gagged on them. Playtex disposables were a natural style of nipple like the breast, but he didn't care for it since I never breast fed. There's a point where you have to stop fighting with them to eat from the bottle and meet their needs. Sure the Vent Aires can be a pain to take apart and throughly clean everytime, but it becomes a routine and only takes a few mintues when emptying the dishwasher. I've never had fungus - rinse out the filter properly before washing or boiling. And tighten the bottom - not a big deal. They helped ""my son"" with his gassy stomach which makes him happy and me."
157354,1,"I ordered this table for my grandson's nursery...it looks better in real life than it does in pictures. It seems to be great quality! Some of the hardware for one of the drawers was missing, but my son contacted the company & they shipped the right parts. It was fairly easy to put together after we had all the parts. The color is truly espresso and we all love it! I will try to upload pictures later...baby is only 2 weeks old, so we are a little busy!!! LOL"
67541,2,"I should have listened to the reviews on this one as they were not too high! It is very cheap, more for a dollar store! The only thing sesame street about it is a big sticker on the front, big deal.... It never closes tight and the wipes dry out all the time! Very very poor item, unusal for Amazon as I buy so much from Amazon and eveything is always great! Not this item, don't waste your money!"
141965,1,"I was a little hesitant when purchasing this product, but there seems to be nothing else out there for cribs with bigger rails. The previous reviews were very helpful and on point. The negatives: sides and corners peel off after following the directions exactly. Also does not stick to areas where baby has already attacked the crib. The positives, IF it stays on it does it's job and protects the crib and more importantly the baby.I reinforced the areas where it wouldn't stay on the crib with double sided adhesive strips (not scotch tape). Buy this product together (or a similar product). [...]I don't think scotch tape will work.Buy it now before your baby begins to enjoy the taste of wood!!!Thanks[...]"
75929,2,"There is adhesive on these, and it would be impossible to store them because of the adhesive. They don't 'cover', they make big round circles under your t-shirt, even with a nice bra. Looks horrible. I hope the adhesive isn't toxic. Promptly returned. DON'T BOTHER WITH THESE -you'll regret it if you do."
39572,1,My son wiggles around so much at night that we decided to keep him in sleep sack after a year to keep him warm during cold winter nights. It's a good fit on my tall baby and very cozy.
12675,2,"We were so excited to buy this only to find out you can't hear anything except amplified noise in the room and my pulse. I am 8 months now and this product only made me worry from the minute I tried it when I did not hear either twin's heartbeat at 5 months! I still can't hear anything with it. Even my doctor &amp; nurses say it's a waste of money. A big disappointment / the only thing I used it for is to play music for the babies which I can do with a CD player, headphones &amp; my own classical CD's. If there was a 'no star' rating, this product would take the cake. Save your money &amp; buy something else that will benefit your baby in the long run."
162061,2,I was given this bathtub as a gift for my first baby. I was excited to use the tub but encountered a difficult time while operating it. It's hard to slide from one size to another and it leaks continously. It is also a very hard material item. I ended up buying another tub with no leaks and cushioning on it. I was surprisingly disappointed.
70656,0,"(I have the previous version of this rocker, the mechanics seem unchanged).Our son loved this rocker as a newborn (1-2 months). We pulled out the ""kickstand"" and that allowed him to be in a flat position and he was very comfortable. Most bouncers are too upright fro newborns. Also, the rocker has two recline positions for you baby's comfort.As he got older (3-4 months), we would push in the ""kickstand"" in so we could use the rocking feature. He liked being more upright than flat at this age. He liked to look around and play with the toy bar. Also, we could rock him to sleep.But, once (around 5-6 months) when he was trying to sit up and lean forward he fell over (the reason for 3 stars only). He was strapped in, so the chair fell over with him. I was in the same room as he was and he is fine - he was just a bit startled.(Think about sitting in a rocking chair and leaning forward - if you cannot lean back then you would fall forward.)I put it away for now and will try it when he can climb in and out of the rocker on his own."
1442,1,Love Pampers from swaddlers to baby dry. We are on size 3 now and have been ordering through Amazon Mom Subscribe and save since baby was born.
44723,0,"I wanted to install this seat in my 98 Honda CR-V. I opened it all up, went to the page on installing with Lap-Shoulder belt, and the top of the page states Warning! Do not install without Top Tether!. Well, if I need to install using the seatbelts, chances are, I don't have top tethers either.So I couldn't install this seat in my car. I ended up putting it in my DH's Grand Caravan, which my kids rarely ride in, and putting the Britax Roundabout from that, into my Honda."
97713,1,the cradle was so easy to build. i did it within 45 min and once set up it is so pretty and sturdy.Instructions for how to convert to loveseat were not included but i'll worry about that later.
119257,1,"My son loves Curious George and this was a nice treat for him. For some reason I though it had more stickers that were smaller, but this is only a large set with the ones shown. Easy to apply."
37963,0,"I bought this to replace my old Schwinn jogger that I dearly loved but had a broken seat. This stroller has a lot of great features. I love the adjustable canopy and handle.The parent console and child tray are handy. Fold is very simple. However, as a previous reviewer noted, one of my back wheels wouldn't snap into place and once it did, it popped back out at some point and I can't get it to stay secured. Also, the seatback is very short and has a rod that borders the entire outer edge of it. My daughter's head bangs against it when we go over bumps. She's 2 and just isn't comfortable in it. She complains after about 15 minutes in the stroller, tells me she wants to go home. I've started using another stroller for our long walks and she's fine. I was hoping to get to use this until she was at least 3, but there is just no head support for her."
125687,1,We like this a lot. It matches all the Happi Tree bedding. It puts out a dim light and its pretty.
100766,2,"I bought these not knowing that they are Pampers ""bargain"" brand. Well, they are certainly no bargain, they are a waste of money. They make the claim that they offer 12 hours of protection but I can hardly squeeze a few hours of protection until they leak or blow out the back. I will definitely NEVER buy these again. The swaddlers are much better diapers"
116118,1,"This high chair has an edge and really is convenient to clean spilled food. My only complaints would be that the seat doesn't rotate around the base so you have to lift the whole chair if you want to switch the facing position of your infant. The base is kind of heavy for that purpose. Still a great, great product."
10576,0,These diapers are too thin (gauzy). I purchased them to use them as burp clothes and they work fine for that function.
140341,0,"This oil is decanted by the seller into a new, unlabeled bottle. No where on the amazon page does it describe it this way and only AFTER you purchase it can you see the sellers note (unless my eyes aren't seeing something). I probably would not have bought this product because I don't typically buy things online that are decanted and not original from the manufacturer, and my reasons are 1) I don't know where or how it's being decanted (cleanliness), 2) I don't like being deceived into believing I'm buying Aura Cacia when it could be another brand (how would you really know?).The oil does smell like lemon, so I'm going to trust that the seller is being honest because I like to believe there are still good people out there. I did write him an email with my concern because the bottle looks like a knock-off (black/white label, fuzzy writing, etc.). I got a very quick, courteous reply, as follows:""Good evening. I do appreciate your feedback and understand your concern. Please note, my seller description does state the oil is packaged in a new, unlabeled bottle. The product is 100% pure and genuine Aura Cacia, purchased in bulk and meticulously re-packaged in new, unlabeled bottles to save money and resources. That savings is passed onto you by selling the essential oil at a lower price, shipping it to you for free, or both.Please know I have been a massage therapist and instructor for over 13 years and would never sell any product that wasn't the pure, original product that you expected. I do hope that puts you at ease and that you will be happy with your purchase. If not, please let me know so that I can resolve this to your satisfaction.""Would I buy from this seller again? No. Will you buy from this seller? You can decide that and what is important to you.This is just my observation and opinion! :)"
61171,1,"I got my Diaper Genie as a shower gift before my son was born in October. Now that he is almost six months old I still like using it. He is now into a size 3 diaper, eating solids, and I have no problem with smell. If it does start to smell (only when emptying diapers), all I do is turn it over and deoderize with a thorough spraying of Lysol. The twist ring has not warped, and I have no problem with changing out the refills as long as I remember to remove the twist ring first. I don't know what other parents are doing to have such problems, but I haven't heard of any of them from anyone here in my town."
3849,1,"Fisher-Price is well known for making toys that ""grow"" with their toughest critics, babies. The Fisher-Price Rainforest 123 Musical Gym is no exception. My son is four months old, and he loves to lie on his back and swat at the toucan rattle, butterflies, and tiger music box. He coos and giggles while he plays with them. There's also a giraffe and palm tree that he likes to look at. As he grows older and begins to lie on his belly more, there's another rattle, a mirror, and a peek-a-boo toy to play with as well. There's even a headrest that can move along with the child as they grow.This toy focuses on development of large motor skills. The ability for the toy to ""grow"" with the child makes it a pretty good buy in my opinion. I recommend it to families with babies who are at least two or three months old."
103902,0,Somehow I got the idea that there would be six bottles. There were only two. $!0.50 seems insanely expensive for only two bottles.
174305,0,"The idea was a good one, but the application not so much. Being a short(5'3"") woman with a tall(6'4"")spouse I needed a strap adjuster to keep from choking myself eveytime I drove our truck. Unfortunately this version slides too easily on the belt when driving and I'm constantly adjusting it. I need one that can be anchored in one place until manually adjusted. But for the price of 6 bucks, I got what I paid for. I will shop around for another model."
104392,1,"We bought two of these to keep the dogs (2 mastiffs) in the kitchen. They are easy to install and relatively unobtrusive. The painted surface is easy to clean.Installation is easy. I thought it may be confusing at first but really it's very straight forward - and no holes to drill. It comes with different size spacers to fit most door widths.Guests do often need to be shown the technique of opening (slide the button and lift) - but it's not difficult once you know how. Most importantly they have worked well to keep the dogs in their place during the day.__Edit 1: One of the gates stopped locking shut when it swings closed - annoying as one of the pups got into the habit of repeatedly nosing it open - a few adjustments got it back on track.__Edit 2: For other pet-owners out there, the distance between the vertical bars is about 2.25 inches. On one of my gates without a spacer the biggest gap is between the edge of the gate and the door frame, and is about 2.5"" (it's much less than this on the other door where I do use a spacer). The height varies from about 39.5"" to 40.5""."
50947,1,"I bought this pillow when I was 16 weeks pregnant because I was having a hard time getting comfortable at night. I loved it from day one and was always finding new ways to arrange it in order to get comfortable at night. I did not use it all the time but as my body changed throughout my pregnancy I would drag it back out and use it for as long as I needed it. There are an infinate number of positions you can use it in and I would encourage any user to experiment in order to get the support they need. I even took it to the hospital with me to use during the postpartum period. My husband loves it too and uses it any time that I don't.One of the best (and most long lasting uses) is for breastfeeding. I keep it on the couch and simply wrap it around my waist on which ever side I am going to feed on. I have a Boppy and a Breast Friend but this seems to be my favorite nursing pillow because I dont have to put the baby down to get it into position. I simply grab a free end and wrap it around either the front of me or the back, depending on how I am sitting. My son is only 2 1/2 months old and weighs 16 lbs so having this pillow be so large and supportive is a huge plus. It's even great for his occasional bottle feedings and also for times when we are just relaxing in bed and I need somewhere to prop him up on. He seems so comfy when laying against it.All in all, it was well worth the money it cost. You don't even have to invest in a pillow case for it if you dont want to because it comes with a removable, washable cover. I would def buy it again!"
159044,1,"I bought one of these for each of my kids, ages 4 and 7. Even though it says it's recommended for ages 3-6, it works great for my kids. I even tried it and it's very comfortable. Regular neck pillows don't work for my kids and standard bed pillows are too big and don't stay in place. I wish I would've found this a few years ago!"
166477,1,"We don't like to have our products selected for us just because of TV commercials or what's most popular. So, when our daughter was born, we made sure to try every diaper brand, even store brands. It didn't take long to find a favorite- Pampers Swaddlers. Since doing our ""research"" we haven't bought or used any other kind. They are the most absorbent and hide smells better than any other."
68532,1,"A must buy for moms of paci-loving babies. Allows you keep the pacifier handy, and lint free. I had one of these on the diaper bag, hooked to my purse, and my belt loop."
155241,1,"This is the best car seat I have ever used! Very easy to use, especially with the latch system eliminates using the seat belts. This seat has a protector around the bottom of the buckle to prevent burns if the buckle get too hot and fabric covers on the top of the straps to keep kids from getting rub marks on their neck."
180174,2,I used this pump with my son who was breast feed for 7 months. It does not hold suction very well and when it did I found it ok strong. I got tears along my nipple that I didn't even get from my baby latching on. I took it on some over night trips when I didn't have my baby and it did not re-leave me at all I would pump 8 oz and still be in pain in certain spots.
24806,1,"We have had this gate for a few weeks and we have no complaints. It is in a hallway to a bathroom and the baby's room so guests must use it for the bathroom.The overwhleming comment from guests is ""phew, thank goodness it is not one of those annoying gates with buttons or handles."" We agree - we love the hands-free!"
162565,1,"I have this tub, and I agree with others that it's probably about the same as all the rest. Some people find baby tubs useful, and some don't. We like this one, and when we give our baby a bath, we don't take all day about it. We soap her up and spray her down. She doesn't need to have a bunch of water to sit and soak in the entire time. One more thing, we did get a sponge for her to lay on to keep her from slipping and sliding all over, but I think that we'd have to do that with any baby tub. All in all, it gets the job done for us."
108799,1,my son had the worst cradle cap - it severly affected his entire face and cheeks. They were red and raised and oily and scaly. I used this foam 2 x a day and I swear it was a miracle. It cleared his skin by 80% in 24 hours. He is only 8 weeks and I was afraid of the steroids and over cleansing him but really this did the trick. I just starting using stelaker too but I don't know if has helped yet. This product is truly perfect for your little sad cradle cappers!!
98389,2,"The pictures shown of this product are somewhat deceiving, in my opinion.First of all, this tub is recommended only for babies over one year old but the baby pictured looks much younger than that.Secondly, it appears as if the baby is submerged in a few inches of water but it's really only bubbles around the baby because this tub doesn't actually hold any water in it.Even worse than not holding water was the fact that it ""floats"" when put into a a larger tub with anything more than an inch or two of water. This in turn creates a ""taco"" effect around the baby... making it so my daughter couldn't sit up in it even though she was steady while sitting up elsewhere. I feel this tub was much too unsafe to use unless the water in the larger bathtub was only 1-2 inches deep (in which case she would become too cold and didn't care for her baths).I finally purchased a bath ring for her and bathing became fun again.On the plus side, I think this item would be perfect for a baby learning to sit up on the floor... just NOT in the bathtub."
119771,1,"I absolutely love this! My little boy made such an improvement in his sitting skills in just 3 days of using this 10-15 minutes a day. He is starting to play with the toy now, and he loves it. I couldn't have been happier."
151700,0,"This seemed really greasy to me. It also didnt smell too great to me, but it wasnt horrible. I ordered this late in pregnancy..I got zero stretch marks. I dont know if I cant count that to the million products I put on (i would forget a lot though..i was not consistent AT ALL!!) or I just got lucky? To me it is worth a shot though!!"
132235,0,"Very pretty in our nursery, but folds and moves very easily. Even when we have it anchored under the rocking chair, it still scrunches and folds, making it a bit of a tripping hazard. If you had hard wood, you could put a non-skid pad underneath without too much trouble, but for a carpeted room, not the greatest."
111009,1,We use this cover almost daily and it does a great job of keeping everything covered with out being in the way. The material is pretty light so it doesn't get too hot underneath. I still have to hold the cover out from my baby's head to get a good view of her but all in all it works fine.
72969,1,"I love this chair, and so does my daughter. She has plenty of room for her legs (we had trouble with another comming right down on her legs), and the table adjust to 3 diffrent lenght's so there is rooom for her to grow. the only complaint I have is that the back cushion comes off every time she eats in it, but that is an easy fix. I would definitely recommend getting this chair it is well worth the $20 a much better option than buying a large high chair that you have to make room for in you dinning room that is well over $100, in my opinion :)."
178467,1,"This is my best purchase as a mother. My daughter (5 months) loves this, she will spend hours in it if she has to. I can't compare to other brands, but my daughter wants to be held nonstop, so this allows me to get somethings done around the house. I also find this easier to manage when I'm out shopping than a stroller. I will say she weighs 17 lbs and is getting a little heavy. I'm hoping this will get us through till she starts walking and just use an umbrella stroller, but if not I'll be in the market for a similar product."
7256,0,"I ordered this bed based on the exceptional reviews on amazon. but i was disappointed. the bed looked nice, but the slats were thin and fragile. it only one bigger piece in the middle; unlike my other toddler's bed, which has 3 stronger pieces. if your kids are small and light, the bed would be ok. unfortunately, it looks too fragile, and the support would bend significantly when sitting at either ends. i don't want a good support for the mattress; and this definitely goes back to amazon... (but how do i ship it back when the box was opened... um...)"
61839,2,"Did you know that diapers have expiration date? Well, you better be careful when buying this product.When my order arrived, I opened the box and took one of the inside packages of diapers (there are 2 packages/box) and found out it had already expired a month ago. I called amazon and let them know about the expired diapers and they said they were going to send another box. After two days I received the replacement....but....for my surprise, it was also expired! I called amazon again and let them know my disappointment and they refund the money. The problem here is that the expiration date comes in the inside package not on the outside carton, so you have to open the box to realize what the exp date is."
7708,1,"This is a great woody smell! Its smell is addicting, makes me want to bite my self sometimes. The price from Amazon is unbeatable."
88268,1,i really think this is a cool well thought out bag - it's extremely functional and looks very urban and cool.
94323,2,"It doesn't matter how you assemble the bottles, they are poorly made and WILL leak. People stop us and ask us if we have problems with leaking too. I wish someone would have warned us before we wasted our money. Don't buy them, you will regret it."
23286,1,Love this storage bin. Keeps organized and takes up less space than bags just sitting in the fridge. I only use it for milk in the fridge and the Lansinoh bags fit great. (haven't tried with frozen ones) Easy for my husband to just pull the first bag out and know it is the oldest. Discreet design-no one knows what's inside unless they are nosy! Recommend this product highly.
175195,0,I feel the bowls are flimsy. at first i was scared to put them in microwave but now I heat food (not more than 10-15 seconds). The cover or packing doesn't say anywhere if they are microwavable or not. I like the lids so that I can cover and keep the extra food. Colors are nice.It's a decent buy.
62906,2,This product has been difficult to use from day one. The Diaper Genie was hard to work every time we tried to cut the bag to dispose of the diapers. I also thought the bagging system was really wasteful and another extra expense. To top it off it finally broke completly after only 5 months of use. We are getting ready to purchase the diaper champ I sure hope it works better than this!
158808,1,Love this sleepsack for my daughter. She always kicks her blankets off and this is perfect to keep her covered. I put her in a long sleeve onesie with the Halo sack. I will order a fleece one for the winter!
147251,1,It's stylish and convenient. I wish the music would play a little louder and the night light was a little bit brighter.
127215,0,"This stroller is certainly light and looks exactly as pictured. It does not feel that sturdy but seemed okay. Most notably, I too was very surprised by how narrow it looked once I recieved it. Now, only a few months later my daughter looks very uncomfortable sitting in it...and forget reclining her in it! I now have to buy another stroller so unless you only want something to use while your child is quite small; trust me and go with another stroller. Oh, and by the way since I know some will assume children that do not fit are large - my daughter is somewhat tall and quite slender. Go ahead, look at the dimensions (I wish I had) this stroller is 17.5 inches wide and most others are 19.5"
112388,1,"We tried multiple brands of diapers after our son was born, and found Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers to be the best fit for him, by far. He is long and lean, and most other diapers are just too wide for him. Pampers fit well and keep everything in!"
140190,2,"This is the worst product I have ever spent money on. The quick release mechanism has never worked properly. I returned it and Baby Trend claimed to have fixed it. However, the issue was not resolved and it is not safe. The seats fold toward each other and my kids lay on each other when riding. It is not a good product and the company is not helpful at all."
9299,1,Nice design and easy for child to sit on.Does not take up much room in bathroom.
167223,1,"This car seat is wonderful. I have two of them. One for each of my children. It is very easy to use and very safe. Since I already had one for my oldest and loved it, it was an easy choice to buy one for my second."
175622,0,"We got this and a another type of swaddle blanket at our baby shower. After using both types for a few weeks now we have found this one is OK but nothing special. Baby can wiggle out without too much difficulty, no matter how careful I am to wrap him. The other swaddle blanket (Miracle Blanket) is MUCH better. I suppose if you have a baby that isn't very strong or doesn't move around much this would be fine."
62524,2,My son is obsessed with the oven. hurried up and ordered some sort of locking mechanism. got this. he was only about 10 months at the time and he ripped the thing off. waste of money.
139293,1,"I was very pleased with the constellation night light. I bought one for both of my girls. The go to sleep every night looking at the stars. It is great how the color can be changed for your preference. The amber is a little dim, but my girls prefer the blue or green. I found it on sale and decided to buy it. I probably would not pay full price though. The original price is a little steep for a night light. Overall, wonderful product. My niece came over for the holidays and loved it. Her parents bought one for Christmas for her as well."
144067,1,"I read the reviews prior to making a purchase, and I have to say, I'm glad I bought this one despite some negative reviews. I don't think any body pillow can help you sleep on your side if you're used to sleeping on your back. I mostly sleep on my side but found it so uncomfortable to try to sleep on my side now that I am 5 months pregnant- Boppy body pillow definitely made sleeping on my side comfortable and switching from left to right was easy. I am so glad I purchased this Body Pillow."
50258,1,"These were exactly what I was looking for. They held together great while we used them on our ""bucket"" car seat. They kept the straps off of our daughters neck and gave her a little extra pillow to take a nap on. We got lots of complements on how cute they are. We'll use them for our next baby, as long as its a girl, otherwise I'll just order the blue ones!!! They wash up great in the washing machine too..."
175208,1,"durable, microwaveable, and lids hold a tight seal. easy to store in one tall stack. vented lid nice when heating food."
179305,2,"Playtex Ventaire Bottles are NOT Bisphenol-A Free. The Playtex Bottles with the liners are considered ok! I was recently informed about the use of Bisphenol -A in some brands of Baby Bottles, After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. The Playtex Bottles with the liners are said to be ok, though the hard plastic shell of the bottle is made using Bisphenol-A, the plastic liner that touches the baby's milk is not! Do your own research. I'm really surprised that the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."
32575,1,I have a preschooler and a 1 year old. I couldn't imagine any better way to keep them away from the wood burning stove. Gate opens both directions so we can easily get wood in and take ash out of the stove. Black color is neutral and blends in nicely. Doesn't look chunky/bulky. NIce design. Easy to remove or add segments to make a custom fit.
113421,2,"Having begun potty training my 2 yr old son (our 2nd child) this has got to be the worst potty chair - especially for a boy. Even with the ""front splash guard"" built into the removable cup it is not good enough to prevent a boy from urinating over the front of the toilet. Personally the lid on the toilet is more of a pain than useful as a step stool when closed. My son rarely uses it for a stool and the lid is annoying. He has fallen over backwards onto the lid while sitting on the potty - and he was not happy about it. The sound box is not worth it either. With the toilet on the floor (and sound box underneath) you can hardly make out the music or your recorded voice. My son has had no interest in the bells and whistles. He is just proud of himself overall and wants to show us that he is a big boy! We are throwing it in the garbage and purchasing the Baby Bjorn toilet with the raised backside. It has much better reviews. I also wanted to add one more thing that we just did for our son. We purchased new boys briefs for him and had them delivered (he got to open the box as a gift to him). He was excited and ooohing and aahhing over the underwear and he knew what to do with them right away. It is more of an incentive for him - and he is eager to wear his new undies when he is ready!"
43222,1,"I have a graco car seat and thought I'd get by without a stroller base. However i quickly realized that it is impossible to carry and get around with just the seat, so I researched and finally bought this stroller frame. I'm so glad I did because I love it. I use it every single day. It's very sturdy for a lightweight, it folds and unfolds easy, the basket on the bottom is big enough for the occasional shopping trip. Just in case the frame were to break (which it doesn't look like anytime soon) I'd buy the exact same one again."
32174,1,"These baskets are great. I first had bought a more expensive set but ended up taking them back when i seen these. The white matches my daughters furniture. I ended up ordering 2 sets in pink and then for my son i ordered 1 set in blue. I keep things like extra diapers and wipes. Onesies, blankets, towels, wash clothes, dirty cloth. They each have their own baskets in their bathroom for bathtime with their towels, cloths, lotions, soaps and toys. They will come in VERY handy for when we can use them to store their toys in when they become more active. They store GREAT in the bathroom closet and also a perfect fit on the changing table. They would also fit perfect under the crib."
56504,1,So far so good. Our 1 year old daugther started spinning them around. Good for younger kids who can reach the oven knobs. Not sure if they will do the job when she gets older.
662,1,We use Pampers and this product was great for us! It arrived quickly as Amazon promised and was by far the best in affordability. Would recommend to a friend.
165606,0,diapers are good but doesn't have trace line(changes color when it is wet)...i would prefer Pampers swaddel next time. diapers are good but doesn't have trace line(changes color when it is wet)...i would prefer Pampers swaddel next time.
145149,1,Just to keep it short. My son loves this and cant wait to get in it every day! Its perfect keeping him company. It packs easy. I put it in my trunk and brought it to the grandparents. Def worth the money!
14663,2,"Plain and simple - these bottles leak! I wish I read the reviews before buying these Avent bottles. My husband and I knew nothing about bottles so when our baby arrived 3 weeks early, we didn't get to research and quickly bought these. I bought several of them and when they leaked thought maybe there was just a bad one in the batch. Every time one leaked, I removed it from the rotation. Well, they all eventually leaked so I can't stand them; it's very aggravating. I've since bought the Dr. Brown bottles and have had no problems with them. I even think my baby is less gassy and spits up less with the Dr. Brown bottles. People complain about the extra parts to clean of the Dr. Brown bottles, but that's less of a pain than having the Avent bottles leak all over you and the baby and wasting formula. I'm going to write to Avent and see if I can get my money back."
25274,1,"I really like this stroller! It is super light, easy to manuver, folds up nicely, my girls love it..and the really love being next to each other! With my stadium stroller someone was either kicking the back or pulling hair..and fighting who is in back or front...the only thing I would say about it...it does just about make it through the door ways..it makes it but a tight squeeze. The canopy I can't figure out for the life of me ...but that is minor...cup holder is decent and at least it holds something. No storage bin but I hang everything from the handles...it's a good buy for the money and my kids love it and that is all that matters!"
94021,1,"If you're searching for an elegant, inexpensive, and virtually instant storage solution for your baby's room, look no further.Although the product description clearly states that this toy bag is part of the ABDC bedding collection, I thought that the color of the bag looked sage and that there was no pattern to it. What I saw in the picture wasn't exactly what I got. The bag has a checked green and white pattern, and the green is a bit darker than the picture looks. It is hard to see that kind of detail in the image even when it is enlarged. The product description lacks any mention of the color or pattern. It also states that the bag features cars and trucks, which is clearly inaccurate.Despite a rather misleading online experience, the bag is still neutral enough to fit into the decor of my baby's room, it's large enough to hold several stuffed animals that would otherwise take up valuable closet/floor space, and it's made well."
156082,1,My 9 month old girl loves this toy. Her big brothers also think that it is fun to twist around.
114269,0,I was looking for a booster seat because the high chair just got in the way. I put my two year old in the booster seat and she is almost to big for it. The tray is so small she just knocks food off of it. She looks like a giant in this seat and she is no giant. This is more for children two and under in my opinion.
83992,1,"The placemat is made out of a very flexible rubbery material that rolls up easily. You just stick it to the table and voila'- Baby has a clean place to eat while on the go! The catch tray helps to keep Baby's food from sliding off the placemat and onto the floor. When Baby is done eating, just dump the crumbs off the placemat, roll it up, and wash it with a little dish soap when you get home. So easy. No more trying to make Baby eat her cheerios off of a napkin or a possibly germ infested restaurant table!I've had the Tiny Diner for over 2 years and it has held up very well.As a mother of 4 young children, I say the Tiny Diner is defiantly worth the $10! Unlike the disposable sticky placemats for babies, Tiny Diner can be used again and again! It makes a great shower gift too!"
84719,1,"At first, I was a little concerned about the fuzzy material with the heat source but it acts as a nice gentle reading light for a child."
172926,1,"I ordered 4 of these for the ""kids"" table. They are sized for 4-7 yr olds but they are pretty sturdy and arrived very fast! The only reason i don't give 5 stars is a couple of them are a teensy bit wobbly. However not enough to be hazardous and a couple of stick on felt tabs helped. I would buy these chairs again and recommend them."
13023,1,"When installed properly, this gate is extremely sturdy. Our 14-month old son often pulls up on it and it doesn't budge. Furthermore, because this gate is portable, it has been very helpful in a variety of situations.I have used this gate to keep my son from trekking onto a wet kitchen or bathroom floor. With practice, it installs in seconds. And instead of closing the door to the office, where there are wires galore, we use this gate. By using this gate (as opposed to closing doors) we have been able to more safely take care of practical tasks, while at the same time, maintain some contact with our son and the rest of the apartment.The price is reasonable and the quality is excellent. We highly recommend this gate!"
39791,1,"My daugher is 15 months old and is a very light sleeper. When my older kids walk past her door talking, she wakes up. I ordered this product when a family member suggested a white noise machine might help. I was willing to try anything and this really, really helped. My daughter loves it and I have no problems getting her to sleep. Some stuff still wakes her up, but it's really loud noises or yelling. If you are having the same problem, I absolutely recommend this. We leave it on the random setting and she sleeps very soundly for three hour naps now."
162938,0,"Excellent for organizing my baby daughter's stuffed animals (she's only 4 months old and received a lot of stuffed toys as presents already). Definitely a lot prettier than the toy bag nets/hammocks. However, I don't know how others have hung this up on their wall. The only way to attach this toy bag is by the side ties/ribbon on either end of the bag (in the item photo, it's the ribbon part) - works well if you want to tie this to the railings of your crib. But to the wall - could not figure out how to do it. At first, I nailed the back part of the toy bag to the wall but the weight of the stuffed animals pulled the fabric out (and the stuffed animals aren't that heavy).I had to attach a cafe curtain rod to the wall then tie the toy bag to it (which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars)."
5293,0,"I just recently purchased these bottles for my little girl and found them to be worth the price. I've never had a problem with them leaking and my daughter is not as gassy since I've started using them. There are a few things that I've noticed about them, though.1. If you have small hands, these bottles are probably a little awkward while handling. Fortunately, I have quite large hands for a woman, so they were very convenient for me.2. It's hard to tell if the nipple is completed through the collar or not just by looking at it. If you pull the nipple until you hear a click, however, you can be sure that the nipple and collar are assembled correctly.3. There are lots of pieces to clean. You have to assemble these for the bottles to work. There's a white liner and a bottom screw in part for the bottle vent that must be cleaned after every use. If you misplace one of these parts, you cannot use the bottle.If you have a Baby Depot (in Burlington Coat Factory) near you, these bottles are also sold there for $11.99."
116120,1,"We've been using for about 2 weeks and couldn't be happier. Attractive, easy clean-up and our daughter feels very safe and secure (the seat has a Bumbo Chair like design it, no sliding out..) We were torn between the Bloom Nano High Chair and this one and I feel like we made the right choice.... I highly recommend this chair for someone looking for a clean, modern high chair."
100681,1,"We've always used Pampers products, but this is the place for a bargain! Quick service and quality product! This is the only diaper that doesn't cause a skin allergy with my child! No plastic touches your baby's skin...love Swaddlers!"
117826,1,"I purchased this when my daughter was four months and was beginning to want to sit up. She's still a little small for it, but she loves to hang in there and watch what's going on in the world, even if she hasn't mastered the jumping yet. Great for getting a baby up off the floor for a change in scenery."
70842,0,"I bought this item because our 2 month old baby always falls asleep in the car. However, she doesn't fall asleep in the infant rocker and she really doesn't like the idea of being strapped in. I guess it really depends on what kind of baby you have and their likes and dis-likes. Another issue I have is the fact that the toys are not interchangeable. I would love to be able to put some of her favorite toys up to make the experience more enjoyable for her, but it wouldn't work unless I have velcro. I'm sure once she gets older, she will love the idea of having her own rocking chair as most children do, but for the moment, it is not in use."
54595,1,"This mobile, by far, is worth the bucks. Our newborn daughter could track the movement of the animals and was fascinated with it before she was even a month old!!! She still continues to lay and watch, smile, giggle, etc. It's her favorite thing and one of the best baby purchases we made!"
69066,1,I love pamper cruiser. I got my order shipped fast. Very good!
22179,2,"I love the Medela Pump and Save bags, but these bags (with the adapter) are terrible. It is extremely difficult to pour the milk out after you defrost it because of the hole at the top (and because the top of the bag is much longer than the previous bags. It is also difficult to pour the milk into the bag if the bag isn't hooked up to the pump. I don't have a Medela pump, but I have liked their breastmilk bags much better than the Lansinoh bags. Maybe they would work better if you have a Medela pump and can hook the bag right up to the pump - though the accuracy of the amount on the bags has never been quite right. Either way, I do not recommend these bags and am hoping Medela continues to offer the bags that don't include the adapter."
106284,2,"I purchased the Diaper Champ for the same reason that most people do... no need to use special garbage bags. However, I was extremely disappointed in how difficult it is to get the top open to change the bags. I break a fingernail every time I have to do it!! Also, my daughter is only 3 months old and her diapers aren't even bad yet; unfortunately, after just a day of changing diapers (and making sure the diaper tags are secure), the darn thing is already difficult to flip. I'm sure it is great about keeping the odor down, but I have to change the bag every 2 days anyway because it is clogged up. I do not recommend it at all."
13506,2,My 13 months old son popped them right off. What's the point if he can just take them off and then chew on the rails. Do not buy this!
59530,1,"We have had this product for 2 years now and it works great! We hang it off the side of the changing table and it keeps everything handy. The plastic is thick and it is very well constructed. The only issue we have with it was keeping the box of wipes from moving about in the space for the wipes. We just use the plastic flip top box the wipes come in and it isn't a wipe warmer so it is smaller. We couldn't take a wipe out of the dispenser using one hand without either lifting the lid off the box or lifting the enitre box. To solve the problem, we just bought industrial strengh velcro and attached it to the bottom of the box and the ""lid"" of the diaper depot. Great product after this minor adjustment!"
181348,2,I have been very disapointed with the Rainforest items but especially this one. It does not travel well nor is it able to be stored easily. My four month old was able to bend one of the arcs and he is not even that strong! I don't think the developers at Rainforest have kids...
84747,1,"WOrks great for us. Put some duct tape, that we got from our local dollar tree, on the sides where you take it apart and hes at a loss. lol so fun seeing him struggle to run out the door. He goes from laughing and running and trying to quickly open the door to His smile slowly fading as he realizes he cant and we are getting closer."
150060,0,"Tne tray is a great buy as it keeps my son's toys from falling on the floor. It is not very sturdy though. I have to give him a whole pad of paper so he won't put holes in it when he tries to color. And I saw one picture with a sippy cup sitting in the corner.... That will not work at all!! Maybe if your car is sitting still, and your child doesn't move at all, it might work then, but I doubt it.I am still mostly glad that I purchaced it though."
56826,1,I love this potty chair. My baby girl started using it at 6 months when she began sitting on her own. Every morning when she gets up she does her pee pees on it. Before bath time she sits on it too. Getting her use to the idea of going potty. This chair is perfect for her too. Easy to clean and simple. Easy to keep her on it too.
172012,1,"A friend recommended this tub to me and I am so glad I bought it. My daughter is only 2 weeks old and I've just started using this tub. Not only does she love bath time, but I find this tub to be more helpful to myself. The newborn net which is securely attached over the tub itself allows my daughter's bottom to stay warm in the water while her head is cradled well above the water level. Her positioning in the tub allows me the freedom to wash her while she lays safely in the net. I would recommend this tub to others who are shopping for bathtime essentials. I love it, my daughter loves it, and it makes bathtime safe and fun."
174840,2,"this thing doesn't work well at all - you'd think it's a simple product, but for a fidgety baby with small fingers, you really want something precise and sharp, to cut the nail on the first snip. this clipper doesn't accomplish the job. we ended up using one that a friend passed along, and really noticed the difference (though I don't have the brand name for you). i've also heard great things about the file--less risky."
53033,2,"This item only seems to want to stick to perfectly square corners. If your corners are beveled, molded, or any deviation from a box corner they will pull away. I got them for the color and high rating, and thought them expensive for a cheap piece of foam. Turns out that I was right about them being expensive for a cheap piece of foam. They are not cast molded. Instead, they are an L-shaped corner bead that is cut, folded and glued to form a corner. As a result, when I taped it down to a beveled furniture corner the glue seams split. Stick to cheaper box store models; you'll get the same results for half the price."
28567,0,"I use this chair at least 4 times a day and have for 7 months. The glider itself has held up very well. Unfortunately though, the fabric is unbelievably cheap. Anytime I get any kind of stain on it (mostly spit up or formula), I'll try to wash it out with water or soap and water and yet it always leaves a hideous stain once it dries. Needless to say my entire chair looks pretty stained at this point. Also, when you first open the cushions, you have to squirt them with Febreeze because the smell is awful. It goes away though."
69725,0,"This gate works just fine; however, my 2.5 year old stuck his leg through the bars during a game of hide n' go seek with the sitter and she had to call 911 to have the fire department get him out. He weighs 30 lbs."
105237,0,"I bought this for my third baby since we had moved into a two story, I felt that I had to have a diaper pail in the baby's room. I had the genie with my second, but hated buying the refils, so I had gotten rid of that long before..I used it some in the first months, but his diapers really weren't that stinky ( breastfed)so odor wasn't really a factor. Then as he got older we were always changing him down on the main floor then walking out the garage and putting it in the garbage if stinky..Buying the champ was pretty much a wast of money for me. I took it to OUAC today and they had never seen it before and seemed impressed with it, only to give me [a few dollars] for it!!!!!!Other than that, if you really need to keep a diaper pail in the baby's room, then it does seem to keep the smell in pretty good."
138042,1,"I like the Twilight turtle, its very cute. I really wish the stars moved! I feel like my infant gets bored with it really quick. I find myself moving it around so it draws his attention again. It works really well light wise, very bright and pretty. The shell is a lot harder than I imagined, so it is for sure not a toy, but I already knew that from some of the other reviews I read. I also can't make out the constellations... oh well :)"
161149,1,"I think this is a good purchase, with a variety of items you will need. Personally I am more comfortable using the scissors to clip my baby's nails, &amp; not all of them include those. Recommended."
95394,1,This met my expectations. I used screw in hooks for the ceiling and it holds all of my daughter's stuffed animals that don't already have residence on her bed.
130305,1,"This swing is awesome. We love the fact that it can change direction. With children (low attention span) sometimes all you need to do is change their view to appease them. This swing is the only thing our son would sleep in (he had mild colic) after the first time he was in it. We got in the bad habbit of letting him do it... Now he sleeps in his bassinette but he stil very much loves his swing. And as for the music and battery issue... The music gets very, very annoying after the first week and if the kids rely on it, it is even worse; you have to keep resetting it. However, common sense would tell you to, as we did, use the cd player or the Choice Music on Digital Cable to lul him and that way the batteries last a lot longer too! Lastly, it is large but there is a quick button on the back that lets you carry it from room to room, which if your kid is like mine, you will be doing. Once you do it a few times it's a piece of cake."
76797,1,This scrapbook includes stickers and protective sheet for the photos. It has enough space to place many pictures! it is very good.... I love it.
88523,1,My son's skin sensitivity works great with Pampers. A great brand and a great loyalty to the brand has been our families opinion. We will always recommend Pampers.
17267,0,"We have used this monitor as well as the Safety First Monitor. This one is far better. We went through about 4 of the Safety First ones due to the loss of night vision. They kept replacing them but eventually we got sick of all the phone calls so when our second child was born, we bought the Quiet Sounds Monitor last June. We have had no problems until last week when the connection between the power cord & the camera broke (something with the the connection points within the camera as I bought & tried a different plug from Radio Shack). Anyway, we called the 1-800 number that came with the monitor & explained the problem. I lied and said I only had it for 3-4 months. In about 4 days I had a brand new working monitor!!! I only have to send back the old one, which they gave me the labels so I don't have to pay shipping."
156785,1,"My son loves playing in the Exersauser Ultra, and treats the whole thing as one giant teether. When I first looked at the Exersauser, I was wary of the concerns posted by some parents but it seems Evenflo has addressed these, and made changes to their product. Having a friend who has an older model, I noticed the following changes: The sounds are slightly higher. The jester rattle no longer has 3 pointed edges on its hat but rather only two but with balls on the end, completely removing the sharp edges. The castle has also had all sharp edges and corners removed by adding an extra molding to the top. The only area that I feel needs to be addressed is one extra height needs to be added for taller children as my son's feets are nearly flat on the base and he's only 6 months old."
100433,1,We love pampers diapers they fit our boy girl twins very well. We have tried huggies and store brand diapers before and were very disappointed in them. Pampers is all we will use! And we use alot!
138461,1,I bought this for my infant. She is 5 months old and I thought she would get a kick out of the lights but my eight year old loves it just as much! She loves looking for the constellations on the ceiling. She will study the book that comes with it so she can pinpoint all the constellations! It has been fun for the whole family! I would buy this over and over! We just love it! And it's awesome because it has an on and off switch. And while we mostly just view the blue the girls really enjoy all the color options! =o)
78441,1,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a great booster seat, but like some of them, I also agree about the unadjustable tray. My 2 year old weighs 31 pounds and has a bit of a belly and I cannot put him in this seat with the tray (even though I bought it for him). And, I'm not quite ready to let him tear up the dining table. So, I have to use it for my 6 month old who has a smaller frame. Otherwise, it's a great seat. I love that it has two safety straps - one that wraps under the chair and one that wraps behind the chair. The three point harness is also a plus over those other boosters that only have the wrap-around straps. The fact that you can fold up the chair and wind up the straps for traveling makes this chair worth the money."
151599,0,"Don't love the smell and this is definitely greasy. I like that the ingredients are all-natural. I have developed mild stretch marks so not sure about the efficacy- from what I read, if someone is genetically predisposed to stretch marks no amount of lotion will prevent them."
105876,1,"This product is amazing. It is easy to change. It uses regular bags. It's odor free. And best of all, you can put the diaper in it and flip the handle with one hand. I absolutely love it. I had the Diaper Genie before this and was so unhappy with it. It broke within 2 weeks of when I started using it. I bought the Diaper Champ for a friend off of her registry, and after seeing how it worked, I bought one for myself. I love this product. It is a must for anyone with a child in diapers."
30323,1,"i purchased this for my 10 month old son, i love it. good price for a 3 piece set."
176734,1,"This bottle cooler/warmer has been such a huge help since we brought it home and plugged it in! Well worth the reasonable price it sells for... I take a prepared bottle from the cooler, pour in the pre-measured water cup... pop a bottle into the steamer basket... push the button, and walk away... I typically change the baby while the bottle warms, and it's ready for him as soon as he's done getting a fresh diaper. It's nice, and saves time, and when you're one hand-handling the whole event, with a baby in one arm, it's nice that you can prep a bottle with just one other hand... I love it.. I am sooooo glad we bought it! I highly recommend this helpful item! It's a must have for those night-time feedings... and equally as helpful during the day as well!"
111332,0,"Great product, works great, my wife loves it. The only reason I gave it a 3 star out of 5 is because of the price. All it is, is a piece of cloth with some wire. Your paying for the name I guess. It is however the best of its kind in the market. My mom said she could of made one herself, which I believe she could of done. Anyways, great product, horrible value."
56782,1,I read the reviews of all the different potty seats and it can be confusing when some people like one and others don't. I bought only this seat and have found that it works great. My son will be three in June 2003 and he can easily use this one and it's easy to clean. The splash guard is great for boys! Definitely a good seat for boys because of the high guard. Very simple but well-made little seat.
83490,2,"After washing once (per the manufacturer's instructions), this item was unravelling at the seams and was covered in fabric pills. I doubt that it is going to withstand much more use. Meanwhile, the Carters waterproof pads that I have leftover from my daughter's infancy are still in great condition.I would highly recommend that you purchase the pads from Carters instead. They are clearly far more durable."
28532,1,"This chair was competitively priced and went together in less than 20 minutes. After two weeks of baby rockin, we're pleased with the chair's performance."
56241,2,"I have researched so many monitors, I could write a thesis. We've had a Lorex for sometime now in our baby's room and screen in ours UNTIL it started clicking/popping at night. So, I decided to buy 2 different kinds of monitors at once and compare and take the 'lesser operating' one back. Well, the other brand is charging as I type, so I hooked this Summer one up -no charging needed.... GREAT picture ...in the dark (w/ nightlight in room)- kudos in that dept. BUT, it's the white static noise that we CANNOT deal with. If it were SOFT white noise, fine. But, nope, harsh static...no sleep static... sleep isn't happening static, sooo back to the store this puppy goes.HOWEVER, if you only want to use this during the day and/or that sound doesn't bother you, then -GREAT picture, clarity & nice big screen."
1879,1,"Not only does my family think that Pampers are the best disposable diaper on the market but we are thrilled that we can buy them at such a great price from Amazon! Especially thanks to the subscribe and save plus the Amazon Moms program, we are getting our diapers at a very affordable cost. The monthly delivery is also brilliant!"
24836,1,"I bought this gate about 2 years ago, when my oldest was one. It has held up very well and is very secure. Now 3, both her and her sister (1 yr) have been caught hanging from the gate. While this is not recommended, I was happy to see it hold up to the weight without breaking open.As for the construction, the bars and gate mechanisms are sturdy and well constructed. This is at the top of our stairs, contrary to mfg's specs, but we are quite happy with the level of safety this provides.One note as to why it is not 5 stars: every few months, I need to tighten the gate mechanism by using the provided wrench. I.e. the gate slowly loosens and becomes unhinged at the top. This is not a major safety issue, however, as you should notice the gate getting easier/looser to open long before it is a real concern.PS - it's nice to have this gate to teach kids that ""naughty puppies"" (dog who begs too close to the table or barks too loud) can get sent to ""puppy jail"" (other side of the gate). Makes for a good visual, too. :-)"
31927,1,I love that they can be washed & resued unlike bags which are a one-time use. I also love that you can add more milk (un-like a bag). The size is perfect and they store great.
15432,1,"My daughter LOVES this pram! She has been playing with it daily. I would recommend buying this for anyone who wants a ""classic"" looking pram."
161507,1,I absolutely love this bathtub. I used the sling when my daughter couldn't sit up and now she sits in the ring part of the tub. It is a perfect size for an infant. My daughter is 8 months old and I think she'll be able to use this tub for a few more months.
122055,1,"We got this after our Baby Bjorn was showered with glass in an auto accident (no one was hurt, luckily). We had been very happy with the Baby Bjorn, but wanted something that could work on the back as well as something that was cheaper since the Baby Bjorn would have been outgrown by our one-year old soon anyway.My husband has used it a couple times, and he likes it as a backpack but feels that the straps cut into his ribs strangely when in the frontpack position. I agree (why do the straps do this to both of us in the frontpack position? It's especially on the left side). Plus I would add that in the frontpack position, the baby's head is up a lot higher than in a Baby Bjorn, and sometimes her head and your chin may get in each other's way.I use it constantly, but only in the backpack position. As a backpack it distributes our daughter's weight very well, and I can carry her for about 90 minutes without getting tired at all--that's a long time for me, much longer than I could use the Baby Bjorn for at this age.Our daughter has mixed feelings about it. She usually dislikes getting into it. Perhaps that is because it's pretty snug for her, and it does take a few minutes to put her in (as with any baby carrier). But then she usually falls asleep quite peacfully after riding in it for five minutes or so, so I guess it must not be too uncomfortable.Despite the fact that you're not supposed to, it is possible to put this on in the backpack position by yourself. It's not the easiest thing in the world, and my husband can't do it, but I can do it in a pinch.All in all I would recommend this. It's inexpensive, and it gets the job done, especially as a backpack."
172852,1,Great Product! I usually have to use this twice in a row because it does not hold everything I need to sterilize.Other then that it does a good job. I use the dishwasher now only about once a week and use this on the other days.Don't want to run the dishwasher everyday!
133447,1,"These are fantastic bottles --sturdy, never leak, baby likes the nipples, no wear and tear from repeated washing, etc. My only complaint is that the anti-gas insert makes cleaning a little more time consuming. That being said, cleaning the insert adds at most an extra couple seconds to my routine. Not enough to make me give up on an otherwise great product. I have tried a lot of natural flow styled bottles and these are by far the best, better than MAMs, which leaked, Avent, which leaked and had BPA, and Dr. Browns, which leaked, had BPA and were a REAL hassle to clean."
143623,0,"these are adorable letters, but don't miss that they are only a couple inches in size. i returned them because they sent his first letter w/o the other two, but nonetheless wanted letters that were the ""typical"" size you see in stores, about 6 inches."
85977,0,"I used to have a Summer Best View monitor, wich I liked very very much. After two years, the handheld had an electric shortcut. At this time I decided to purchase another one, since I don't live in USA and could not ask for service. Then I have chosen this Summer Infant Handheld Color Monitor w 1.8"" screen, since it's +- $50 bucks cheaper. Well, I can't compare one to another. In this one, you can't zoom, can't move the camera remotely w/ the handheld, and statics is kind of loud. Best View is digital, doesn't have interference and almost no noise. Best View is much, much better. Spend a little more, get a greater product."
50277,2,I am a car seat technician and I am here to say... DON'T use this product or any like it! The strap covers can be a danger in an accident and if the car seat didn't come with them then you are not supposed to use it. There is no way to know what these would do to the straps in a collision. To use products like these is to risk your child's life.
2983,1,"I bought these sheets to go with the Wendy Bellissimo Vintage Fire Truck bedding. They're not quite as thick as the sheet that came with the set, but they're cheaper and very soft and they washed up much better. The sheet didn't shrink at all and doesn't hardly wrinkle, and none of the stiching is coming undone after many washes."
171110,0,"Our daughter loves all of the pictures that this album holds. The problem is that the pages stick together, she's been using it for about a month now and it is getting a little better. It is a little cheesy looking, but she is happy."
103814,1,"I was a little apprehensive about the price tag, but this thing really does work as described. It is well worth the $200 bucks. We had a cheap FisherPrice baby monitor that was unusable because of the static. This one is completely quiet unless the baby is making noise, and then it is crystal clear with no background hiss or static. You can adjust the microphone sensitivity, but the default setting was perfect for us, and allows you to hear small sounds clearly. I also like the room temperature monitoring function."
34101,1,"Recently bought a second bag. No worries, the first one is still going strong - our family has grown and we needed another bag and based on our experience with this car seat travel bag, we did not even hesitate buying one more.First of all, the material is much thicker and stronger than I originally expected. It holds up well and is easy to wipe clean. The straps are nice and strong, and my husband swears they are comfortable too - he does most of the hauling. It sits well on your back (just the right spot) on an average height person but even a petite woman like me can't complain and I'm barely 5 feet tall.We were trying to choose between a bag with straps vs. bag with wheels and are really glad we went with straps. We don't use backpacks when travelling so it is very convenient to throw this on your back so your hands are free to pull suitcases, push a stroller or carry a cranky toddler!"
42420,1,"I recieved two carriers at my baby shower. A front to back, and a sling. My daughter never really liked the sling, and the F2B carrier was very uncomfortable and started to rip at the seems after only a few uses. My MIL recommended the Moby after hearing about how wonderful it was from a co-worker. I found it here at Amazon and figured it would be worth a try since my little one loves to be held all the time and the other carriers just weren't cutting it anymore.I am so glad I invested in this product. I opened it and the first thing I noticed was the incredible softness of the fabric. I thought it would be hard wrapping around my body and figuring out how to position her correctly, but the directions were easy to follow, and it was no more difficult than trying to put her in her front to back rider. I felt very secure with my 17 pound baby in it. My shoulders dont hurt after wearing it, and it looks alot better than the other less fashionable carriers. My daughter seems to enjoy it too. We plan on using it for all of our outings now, and will probably invest in another for my husband. I can't wait to take her to the beach now. My only complaint is that I didnt know about this sooner! So to anyone thinking of buying any other carrier for your child, don't waste your time and money."
117673,0,"The bumper jumper is wonderfully made, I especially like the soft ""bumpers."" The bad ... we have made the jumper as short as we can and it's still too long for an average size door frame. Come on Graco, you can do better than that!!!"
169099,1,"I like the swaddlers diapers better than any other pampers type or any other brand, for that matter. There is something in these diapers that wicks away the mess or wetness from the baby's bottoms. My baby's poop has never been smushed against her skin when I use these. I did a diaper raffle for my baby shower and got at least one package of every kind of diaper on the market and have tried all of them. These are by leaps and bounds my favorite."
115784,1,"This is a great stroller. It's very light, folds up well and so small in the back of my mini van. My husband and I use this for both my 8 month old and 2 year old. The younger baby uses it more and seems to enjoy her ride. The strap which goes near the crotch is fixed very close to the edge of the seat, so my baby doesn't stay seated towards the back of the chair. She kind of slides towards the front, but not usually. For my 2 year old, this problem is not an issue since she is bigger. The position of the chair in its fullest recline isn't as far back as I would like but it is at an angle that makes my baby comfortable enough to fall asleep. My husband is 5'11"" and he sometimes kicks the back of the stroller if he is not aware of his distance. The plastic lock that holds the stroller closed when folded is extremely difficult to latch on, but not hard to open. The tangerine color is beautiful too. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that needs a single, lightweight, all-purpose stroller."
106369,2,I got the diaper champ for my first baby. I thought it would be great since it used regular trash bags. It wasn't even two weeks after my son was born when the seal came out and his room smelled awful. I threw it away. It was the biggest waste of money. I bought the Diaper Genie and it's worth having to buy the special bags. It works wonderfully.
88202,1,"My two month old son absolutely loves this playmat. We chose this one for several reasons: 1) the hanging animals actually face him- he sees more than just the seam; 2) the mat is bright and fun, and there are even two flaps that crinkle and squeek; and 3) the mat is square rather than long and narrow.My son took to this immediately, but it may be a good idea to take off some of the toys before putting your child under it for the first time. He seemed a bit overwhelmed the very first time we used it. The toys are easily removed, and their position can be changed. You can also buy additional toys if you wish. I have also been pleased that the mat is rather thick and seems to be comfortable.This product is definitely worth the extra money."
49991,1,"We purchased the ""Basic"" and I (or I should say my baby and I) love it. I am a mother of 3, with the baby at 7 months, this product tatally gives me some much needed freedom. She loves it and falls asleep nearly everytime she is in it. She enjoys the closeness, comfort and the feeling of being tended to while i am still able to sweep, clean, walk or just about anything necessary. Plus, with her weighing about 23 pounds she will be able to enjoy it for some time. the best advantage is that I find it easy to to get her in and out of. I just sit her down, snap it on my waist, pick her up and put the strap over my head. No problem. It is so less combersome than the infant snugglies and it doesn't take a crow bar to pry them out! The Hip Hammock has definently been a plus. (I also love the fact that it rolls up and fits in the diaper bag!)"
137574,2,"This is the dumbest thing I ever bought. I thought the lights automatically change and that it had music. If that were the case, i could justify may spending $[...] on it. All it has is static color lights you turn on and can't turn off. It has a hard shell so my daughter can't play with it. It is boring and useless. Don't waste your money"
119314,1,"I didn't discover the Brest-Friend until my 3rd baby, but WOW! The lumbar support was exactly what I needed and the firm, flat surface supported my baby just right. Aside from swaddle-blankets, this is the best baby purchase possible! GET ONE! Plus if my toddler misbehaves while I am nursing, I can stand up to redirect the child ...then return to nursing in a snap because the pillow is ready."
118321,1,"We couldn't live without these. The bags were just too difficult. I don't understand how some people have trouble with the lids when they always work for me, but when I tried using bags I would drop them and make a mess. The pros are: stackable, pre-sterilized, easy to handle. The cons are the cost. I use a Medela pump and just pour into these and stack them in the freezer. I use a permanent marker to write the date. There are 3 lines for dates. You cross off and enter the next one. After the third use, you know to throw them out. In between uses I sterilize in the Avent Microwave Steamer. What could be easier?"
122418,0,"Star Explosion is pretty cool, and you do get alot for the money, but they dont glow very long. You can leave the lights on in the room for hours, turn them off and the stars glow for about ten to fifteen minutes and thats it. If you use a black light they look great, but on there own, not so much."
138987,0,I really loved this when i seen it and just had to have it . I guess i got excited and forgot to look at the size of it and when i got it in the mail it was smaller than what i had expected.The shell would fit on a piece of notebook paper (roughly) . Just wish it was bigger. Still love the look and idea of it.
50136,2,"I hate this stroller and am getting rid of it. I intially bought it because of the peg perego reputation and it looked good.CONS:Big, bulky, HEAVYHard to open and closeHorrible instructionsToo complicated and time consuiming to change from stroller mode to carriage modeHard to reach basket when car seat is incup holder is a jokeNo hood window so you can't see the childdoesn't go over curbs wellPROS:Good constructionSmooth ride"
125152,1,"My baby loves it, I even got one for her friend :) It was way too big for her at first but now she absolutely loves it!!!"
32872,1,"We are extremely excited about our Baby Bjourn carrier. We had tried several others and were ready to give up on the idea due to frustration. However, the baby Bjourn carrier is so simple to use and our daughter loves it. It goes on and off with ease, even while she is sleeping. The only down side to this carrier is that the straps are made for medium build or large build adults. We have had to purchase large straps for my husband because he is quite a bit taller than I am. This can get pricey, but trust me it is worth the extra dollars to invest in this great carrier. If you are looking for an infant carrier, this is the best!"
160918,1,"Gave this to my son- he actually uses it! What more can I say?! :)Oh, I put this on my list for him to get for his new father friends.."
56637,1,"We tried another type of fridge lock and this one was less expensive and is much easier to use! Blends in nicely with our fridge so it doesn't look like an eye sore, great product!!"
32473,1,"This is a great gate. It is easy to install and it looks really nice. The gate comes with one extension on each side of it(they must be added on each side. You can't put both on the same side.) The gate is very sturdy. We like that it is a multi-step opening system. You have to press in the button, lift the handle, and lift the gate in order to open the gate. We are very satisfied with this gate and would recommend buying it."
174057,1,"WOW!! This swing has been a life saver. My son LOVES his swing! It's proven to be the best baby shower present ever. I highly recommend this swing. Your baby is happy, content and falls asleep easy giving mom time to get things done!!! Love love love it!"
33390,1,"I used these breast shells years ago when I had my daughter. Before I bought them, I drenched every outfit both of us wore at each feeding. My 'opposite' breast leaked right through all the breast pads and all over our clothes. The breast cup proved to be a lifesaver. It collected all that milk that came from the other breast and because I sterilized the breast cups, I was able to save the milk for a later feeding by Daddy. I am expecting again and just purchased this set. It was a 'must have'."
156377,2,We were disappointed that the sack portion of the 2T-3T Big Kids SleepSack Wearable Blanket with foot openings is about four inches shorter that the XL SleepSack without foot openings which we have been using for some time.
106288,1,We decided to try something different after hearing all of our friends complain about the Diaper Genie and we are glad we did. There is absolutely no odor until you open the lid to change the bag which is about twice a week (garbage nights) and it is easy to operate with one hand so you can keep the other hand on the baby. I recommend it to everyone I see at the store registering or looking at the diaper pails.
181794,1,"The Bag is rugged, cool, lot's of storage compartments, & you don't look dorky like with those other cheezy diaper bags.However, i think it is a tad bit overpriced; Although it seems as though this will last until my baby's ready for Junior High. Maybe then I'll be better able to gauge if the price is worth it."
135194,1,"I have used the Wipes Warmer for both wipes and to keep my son's bottles warm and it is FANTASTIC!!! I have 2 of these units, one I use for keeping the bottles cold, too. I definately recommend this to all mothers on the Go!"
73759,1,"This item is fantastic. I got one for myself and my sister for her new baby. I am about to get another one for my friend's baby shower. A unique gift idea for parents-to-be.Why is this gadget so great? Because it takes the time calculations out of keeping track of your baby's needs. You don't need to add hours up in your head or off a paper. You just easily look to this device to know how long ""itzbeen"" in hours & minutes since you took care of a specific baby's needs. When you are sleep deprived with a newborn, this gadget really helps keep a simple picture.The ITZBEEN will tell you how long since your last diaper change and feeding. How long baby has been sleeping. The last icon is a ""wild"" card. We used it to keep track of my painkillers post C-section.Only thing I don't care for is the automatic red blinking light if you let baby's diaper time go beyond 3.5 hours, which may happen during the night sleeps.If you use this gadget as it is made to be used, it will help you out."
123953,1,"For my first child I had an Eddie Bauer travel combo. Hated it. It was big, bulky and I was just not happy with it at all. Second time around we purchased a Phil and Teds classic stroller with the second seat. That thing is a money pit. After breaking two handlebars which are necessary to hold the infant carseat.. I've gotten the Snap n Go which is something I've always entertained the thought of buying. Let me just say, I should have bought this for child number one! This thing is awesome! Very simple, yet it has what I need. Two cup-holders. A place to put my keys and phone. A basket on the bottom for the diaper bag. My Eddie Bauer infant car seat rests on this stroller absolutely perfectly. Then we just strap it on for safety. Highly recommend!"
77766,1,You get what is advertised. This rug is thick & luxurious. It looks great next to my bed and my toes like the feel of it in the morning.
86219,1,"I have two of these monitors (silver and pink) and they are great. I love the video, especially since my twins tend to wake up quietly. It's great to be able to check if they are simply rolling over or are standing up waiting for me to get them without having to open the door.Important to note, if you want to watch two children in two different rooms, you need two complete monitor systems. This is because the handheld monitor can only monitor one camera at a time. You would only be able to hear/see one child at a time, and unless you wanted to spend all night switching between the two cameras, you need one monitor for each room.If you want to watch one child in two different rooms, you just need to get an extra camera. Super simple to add a camera; just set one to A and the other to B. The handheld monitor is set to whichever camera you want to watch.I have noticed that the pink camera seems to be ""zoomed in"" compared to the silver camera. By this I mean that the pink camera gives me a close-up view and the silver camera is more like a wide angle view. It's not good or bad, just something that I noticed.Here's a quick run down on the monitor.Pluses:-- Good video even in little or no light: We tested this in daylight as well as in a dark room with and without a nightlight. The video was very clear and crisp regardless of ambient light.-- Easy set-up: It was very easy to set up the camera. I have them sitting on shelves (with the cord out of reach of my twins) rather than mounted on the wall. It means that I can move them from room to room as needed.-- Long battery life: I have the monitors on and plugged in over night (about 8 hours) and the charge will last all day (about 5-6 hours of actual usage). Of course, the battery last as long if you check the video frequently.Quirks:-- Background hum: There is a hum in the background that can be annoying, but it doesn't ever obscure the audio. The mic is very sensitive and you don't have to turn the audio up very much to hear your child well, which means that the hum is very soft.-- No volume markings: I found this annoying because the on/off dial is the same as the volume dial. You have to re-find your volume setting every time, and if your child is quiet, it can be hard to tell if you have it set loud enough. The way to get around this is to take a marker and mark the dial at your preferred volume setting.-- Handheld interference: If you have two handheld monitors, they can cause interference. All you have to do, though, is turn them to different angles until the interference stops.-- Camera interference: Once in a great while there will be interference between cameras, where you can see a faint ghost image of the other video. If you don't need both cameras on at the same time, turn off the one you're not using. If you need both on, as in my case, simply flipping the handheld switch between A and B once or twice will remove the interference.Overall, this is a great video monitor system and I am so glad that I got it."
48076,0,"When I bought these, I didn't read close enough. I thought these were the actual DROP IN bags, not the sacs that you have to fold over the rim. I don't like these one's as much because they aren't as easy and they tend to leak more when I am not paying attention. They still work great normally and I wouldn't complain, it's just my personal preference to have the actual drop and go sack / bag."
146664,1,"This is my second Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo. I had one with my 3rd child and gave it to a friend when he out grew it. When we were surprised with baby #4 and she turned 6 months, I knew exactly what jumper I wanted. This thing is high quality, easy to put together, fun and CUTE! I would recommend this product!"
153442,1,"After a lot of research, my husband and I purchased the 2008 Indie in Spice for our first child. We had it narrowed down to the BOB Revolution and the Indie, and after trying both, chose the Indie. He's 6'4"" and I'm 5'1"" and the adjustable handle is wonderful! It easily adjusts to fit both of us and anyone in between, even while walking. It folds easily after a little practice and fits in the trunk of both of our small sedans, although it does not leave a lot of room in either. In addition, the zip off boot is great!The only con I would give it is that it's listed as a jogging stroller, but when I locked the front wheel in order to do some slow jogging, the wheel wobbled quite a bit, enough to where my child became irritated.Overall, if you're going to invest in a good stroller, this one should be near the top of your list!"
86621,1,"Neat Solutions 40-count Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat CoversThis is a great product. Not only does it provide a germ barrior, it also provides a moisture barrior. So that your child's tender skin is protected."
163351,1,"This is a great high chair. It secures tightly to your own chair, so it doesn't take up extra space and is more steady than a higher chair. Also, since it's on your own chair, you are at the perfect height sitting next to it. I love the recline features...3 different positions. My (almost) 6 month old just started eating cereal and some first foods, I recline her while she takes a bottle and then can easily sit her up to start eating food. The padding seems comfortable, and is vinyl, so it cleans up easily."
97604,1,"WOW! Great potty chair! Received quickly and our son's interest started immediately. Cute little potty chair too. Compact, all one piece, no assembly required, cute and versatile. Great Buy!!!!!!!!!"
116290,1,"I have tried so many things to keep my very smart 2 1/2 year old daughter out of my sons closet but she was figuring out every kind of child lock. I have sliding closet doors and this easily is put together in less than 5 minutes. I was able to put it high enough out of her reach and she cannot figure it out. While it is very simple to use, flip up to open and flip down to lock, she just cannot reach it to even try. Now only if i can get my son to remember to lock it before he goes to school! :)"
5961,1,"Love this product - good price, easy to install, and works well. I've only had one intermittent problem with the product, which I describe in the update at the end of this review.This product was easy to install and came with the hardware needed to do so - namely, a longer center screw. Two nice touches: 1) the screw head is painted white so that it blends in with the cover, and 2) the cover comes with a thermal gasket to insulate the wall opening around the socket and hopefully save you energy/money. (Note: if you buy the bulk pack of these, you only get 5 thermal gaskets for the 25 covers. But if you buy the single outlet cover, which is what this review covers, every cover comes with a thermal gasket.) All you need to install your outlet covers is a flat-head screwdriver. One reviewer mentioned having to go to the hardware store to get a longer center screw. Not sure if Mommys Helper has started including a longer screw in response to customer complaints, if this reviewer just didn't notice the included screw, or he got a defective cover. In any case, all of mine came with the necessary hardware.The product also seems sturdy and to work very well. When the center screw is tightened, it fits firmly against the wall, just like the original outlet cover. The sliding covers snap back very smoothly and quickly when you unplug something. My baby hasn't yet shown an interest in electric outlets, but as well as these covers seem to be designed, I don't see how he'd be able to get to the socket with these covers installed. (I'll update this review as he gets older if he figures out how to circumvent the sliding covers, but I'd be surprised if he did.)Note: this particular version of the product works only for outlets with one center screw, so if you have a different style outlet, you'll need a different baby-proofing solution for your outlets.UPDATE, January 2012: I've discovered one problem with these outlet covers, and it has caused me to dock one star from my initial rating. Namely, sometimes when I plug a really heavy plug - or more often, a plug with a long heavy cord attached to it - into outlets fitted with these covers, the plugs have a hard time keeping contact with the socket. For example, when I use my carpet shampooer, which has a fairly heavy plug and cord, the power supply to the shampooer will sometimes waver, causing the shampooer to flicker on and off, even though the plug looks like it's seated properly in the outlet. Normally, just pressing the plug more firmly into the outlet fixes the problem, but occasionally it does not, and then it's maddening to try to shampoo! I only have this problem with a couple of outlets in the house, and I can't figure out what makes these outlets different, so I basically just try to avoid using them when I'm running the shampooer."
175339,2,"When my daughter was 14 mos I saw these and thought it would be a great idea to prevent snack spills, etc. so I bought a few. Unfortunately, the lid is WAY too easy for her to take off - in fact she even found removing the lid to be fun and ultimately rendering the function of the thing useless. If they made the lids more snug then it would be a 5 star product, however, I have to give it only 1 star since the lid-issue makes it no better than a regular bowl."
162562,1,"I had the bath sling at first but had the same problem as everyone else (the lower portion not staying down). THIS tub is fantastic, especially since we travel a bit. At home, you can fold it up and store it so it doesn't take up all that space in your bathroom like a regular tub. (I keep it in the closet.) It's comfortable and keeps the baby in a good position."
26984,0,"I had been having sever upper back pain when I purchased this belt. It does seem to offer some support for my belly, but doens't seem to ease my back pain much at all. It is quite comfortable though, I am able to sit down or drive in the car with it on. I ordered a medium and I have to wear it on the tightest setting - I weigh ~ 170 pounds at 7 months pregnant, wore a size 6 / 140 pounds pre-pregnancy. So I probably should have gone by the official product sizing as opposed to the advice that it runs small. The seam on one of the hook and eyes is already coming loose (started to come loose after only 1 or 2 wears) so I am going to have to sew it. Overall, not a bad maternity belt for the price, comfortable and supportive but didn't help much with the back pain."
172341,1,"I purchased this bath seat this afternoon and I could not wait for nightime to get here so I could try it out. I love the seat and would recommend this seat to other parents. My daughter is almost 5 months old but she can sit up on her own, she loved the seat as well. She was getting tired of her baby bathtub, she did not want to lay down in the tub anymore-since she is a ""big girl"" now. I also bought her some bath toys with this seat and she loved batting at the toys and the water and making it splash. I have a traditional tub and it fits perfectly on the tub and is very secure. I read lots of reviews before buying this seat and was a little apprehensive, but I am so glad I tried it out. I am a very satisified customer with a very happy clean baby."
109007,2,"Yes, this is a good stroller, but the price being asked for it is ridiculous. I have one and have been happy with it, but there is no way that it is worth $300, especially in this economy. It retailed for around $125 (I paid $115) and I see them occasionally on e-bay for under $100. Do yourself a favor and if you really want one of these do not pay the +$300 they are asking and just shop around. There are also plenty of really good tandem strollers from other manufacturers for sale here on Amazon that are much more reasonable in price."
128612,1,"This mattress pad is soft, but not too cushiony. Also, the waterproof element is located INSIDE the pad, so you don't have too much of the annoying plastic/vinyl rubbing sound or feel. The pad has protected our mattress from many a baby attack."
82809,1,"We used our sleep sheep constantly when our son was first born. It helped soothe him everywhere from his bassinet to his carseat to his stroller. It was nice to have such a PORTABLE sound machine so that we could place it in his pack and play when he was napping somewhere other than home.I only have three complaints, all of which could be easily remedied by a few small product design changes -1) There is not option to keep the sounds playing continually. This would REALLY improve the products overall effect. When you are using the sheep to drown out outside noises so baby can nap, you need the product to stay on until you turn it off, not shut off on a timer.2) When the sounds finishes, it simply shuts off abruptly, rather than fading down slowly. As my son got older he was awakened from his sleep on more than one occasion by this feature.3) There are no womb sounds or mothers heartbeat, which should be a MUST on any infant sound machine."
1909,2,"People kept telling me to try Pampers because they hold a lot of pee. We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink. I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change. We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on. I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right. It says these are good for 12 hours. Not for us! They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder. My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell. Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad. I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never. Again."
16423,1,My baby has very sensitive skin and gets a diaper rash every couple of days. I have used other creams but keep coming back to this one. I have been using this on her ever since she was a new born and she is eight months old now. It is gentle enough to use after every diaper change yet effective enough to handle bad rashes. I use it both as a rash preventive measure and for healing. I also use it on her skin and on my own for chronic dry areas. I love the fragrance too.
137265,2,"I got this stroller to go with the infant car seat, so I made the mistake of not looking at the stroller in the store. I would strongly encourage you to go someplace to try it out, along with several other strollers. It is not very well-designed, and I had the following issues: 1. the main problem is that it does not turn well at all. We tried letting the front weheels turn vs. having them fixed, and either way the stroller was hard to turn/maneuver, especially with one hand (which happens when you are carrying packages in he other!). 2. The storage underneath is too small and hard to access. 3. There is no tray accessory for when your child gets older and you want to put a sippy cup or snack out. 4. Every time you open it when you attach the infant carrier, you have to put the seat down, which takes TWO HANDS - meaning, you have to remember to do this BEFORE you take the carrier out of the car, and if you forget and it's wet or raining hope that you can set it on the seat of the car! 5. It's difficult to open and close, compared with other strollers I've seen - you have to find a small latch on the side of the stroller in order to latch it shut.Overall, I have friends with other strollers that are much better designed and I wish I'd tried some out before registering for this one."
30380,0,"My baby HATED his baths, until I bought this tub. He LOVES the bubbles from the spa unit, however, we have had NO luck with getting the shower to work. I phoned the company and after a very nice, helpful conversation, the person at the company thought the shower must be broken. Well, within two days, I received a new spa/shower unit and I can't get the shower to work on this one either! Not to mention, it is like impossible to get the system open to put batteries in. Sorry girls...if you're anything like me, you will NOT be able to open this to put batteries in! The tub is roomy, the sling is really nice, but...my baby has a TON of hair and I really wanted this shower part to work so I could rinse him. He's baby #3 for me and I really thought this was a cool invention, to have clean water right there to rinse with and now it doesn't even work!! For $40 it should!! The bubble feature has been a life saver, at least my son now enjoys his bath, but...it's a bit pricey to not be ""perfect."""
57485,0,"This seat is entertaining and yet not too stimulating so that the baby could relax and maybe take a nap in it, and that is exactly why I bought it. But if you are looking for something more fun and exciting for your baby to play in then I would suggest something like the fisher price rainforest bouncer.This seat looks very cozy, but I'm not sure that it really is. It seems to me that my son's back is always arched when he's sitting in it. I don't think that the curvature of the back of the seat is right for the baby's back, and that applies for both the reclined and inclined positions. On the other hand, the fact that it has 2 positions is very useful. I mostly keep it in the reclined position but I use the other position when the baby had just finished eating to keep him slightly upright to stop him from spitting up.The pad that lies under the baby is not fixed to the lining of the seat and keeps slipping down and folding under the baby making him uncomfortable. The cushions on the sides of the pad are cozy for a newborn baby but once the baby becomes more active, they seem to hinder his arm movement. I would suggest that you remove the pad and the little pillow once your baby is able to support his own head, although it is easier to wash the pad rather than remove the whole seat lining to wash it.The vibration and the music seem to have a soothing effect on my son although it took him a while to get used to the vibration, it made him cry the first few times we turned it on.The curved bar that holds the toys above the baby could simply be pushed back making it easy to put the baby in and take him out of the seat. I think it is more user friendly than most other seats.I would give this 3 and half stars if I could. Good luck making the right choice and I hope my review is helpful."
182773,1,Quite satisfeid with the car seat. Had no problems with it for my 5kg baby 90 day baby girl using the rear facing installation postion. Very good product especially in its price range.
38707,1,"This is an amazing product. I use this with the Infant to Toddler Bath by Evenflo and the combo works great. The baby is comfortable and doesn't slip around. Holds up nicely, baby is so comfortable. I used this product until my baby was able to sit up. I have another one on the way, and am going to use this all over again with her. A must have; I highly recommend."
29858,1,This 6 Piece Oral Care Set is great for my 7 month old she is starting to stick stuff in her mouth and this is great for her. I can put the little rubber finger on my finger and she sticks my finder in her mouth and as she is chewing on my finger I am also cleaning her mouth all of the other tools are great for her when she gets alittle bigger there is also a teether that she just loves. And the best part of the whole Oral Car Set is that is comes with a stand to hold all of your items. Any parents would like this item as much as the child.I would purchase this for a friend as a gift for her new baby.
13991,1,"I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3.5 stars. I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak. After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these. When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different. Oh, wow, what a diffrence. Baby is 4 months old and no leaks. The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn't leak a bit. The new nipples have the words ""Extra Soft"" on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned."
149009,1,"My back & hip pain started early, at about 14 weeks. I would wake up around 1 a.m. and be unable to go back to sleep from the pain. My first night with this pillow I was pain-free and have been for the last two weeks. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering back & hip pain.Other reviews about the stiffness of the neck area are correct. It is very hard and uncomfortable if you try to sleep with your shoulder against it. I don't - I sleep with my shoulder on top and that works perfectly well for me."
168817,1,"We've tried Luvs, Huggies, and Kirkland and our son leaked through all of them. Pampers are the only diapers that have actually kept our little one dry. We will only be purchasing this brand now."
31127,1,"We really love our Joovy Caboose Ultralight stroller! We have used it with our toddler (now preschooler) and our baby for almost 10 months now, and we couldn't have gotten around without it. It is smaller and much lighter weight than other double strollers, but it feels sturdy. It maneuvers easily, especially for a double stroller. Both kids look comfortable riding in it. The back-to-back positioning for the kids is good, because they don't grab each others' things. Everytime I go out with this stroller, I have people telling me what a well-designed stroller it is and asking me where I got it."
55667,0,This bottle warmer is slow and seems to accumulate some guck at the bottom. It does get the job done so I gave it three stars.
71803,1,"I recently purchased this Fisher Price Potty On the Go. I was so happy when it arrived, the carry case is really nice and discreet looking, it fits easily in my trunk and I take it everywhere. I no longer have to worry when I take my toddler who is in the middle of potty training out of the house. She loves that it's a little higher than the regular potty chairs. I love the fact that I can avoid public restrooms. I look forward to using this on our next road trip and also camping. It folds easily and it comes with nice bags but I know I can also use any kind of bag I want like supermarket plastic bags (reuse/recycle!). I recommend this to anyone and even if a child is a little older, it can come in handy if you need to pull over someplace on a long trip. It's so clean to use you never touch anything you just tie a knot in the bag and toss it out. I haven't used the pads they included (they look like nursing pads) to absorb so far I just use only the bag, I also keep a clean bag in it at all times so I don't have to first insert a bag when I am about to use it for my toddler. The carry case even fits in the bottom of my stroller basket. I'm always going to have this travel potty with me and I'm so glad I found it. ps It's also great to leave at Grandma's house when my daughter stays overnight until she is ready to use the bathroom toilet. My child is 34 lbs and fits on it very comfortably I think she could use this camping too for up to about 50 lbs."
109255,1,A must have if you are breastfeeding. This pillow is comfortable for both mother and baby (who is now 9 months old). Slipcover can be easily washed and easily adjustable for mothers who are losing their baby weight. I use it everyday about 5 times a day and I miss it when I am not home and breastfeeding in someelse's house.
107942,0,I originally bought this because it bears the Avent name and we use the bottle system which we LOVE. I did not have very good luck with this pump. It was extremely hard to get the pump properly placed in order to express any milk. It was cumbersome and I became very frustrated within a short time. I'd try the electronic Isis pump before this particular model.
58666,1,"I love this sterilizer. It is quick and easy to use, it's perfect if you have a small amount of space. Just make sure that you let is sit for a few minutes so that you won't burn yourself, be very careful. I would not want any other sterilizer, for me it is really perfect."
173114,1,"These seat savers are great. For the safety factor, I love that they really grip both the car and the kids' car seats. I like the black better than the tan, as it hides the dirt and scuffs. I've had our original one for 5 years now, and it is good as new. Highly recommend."
31406,0,I like everything about it & its a good size the only thing I didn't like is that the little white plastic sticks that hold the bottles aren't strobg there all cheapy.. That is if yuh want to dry GLASS bottles . If you only use plastic or intend to use it for plastic only then this is for you
89792,1,"I've used these diapers since my daughter was two months old...she is now 9 months old, and we've never had a leaky diaper! These are the best! These are the only diapers that don't leak overnight in our experience, and we've tried a lot of different diapes. These were the winners!"
54197,1,"This is both my first baby, and first mobile. The baby has liked this mobile quite a lot. He will often watch it until the music finishes. I don't get any sense that he discriminates between the three tunes that are played.He is starting to show some signs of getting bored with it. But for about three weeks it captivated his attention. Also, now, it looks like he is trying to ""take swings"" at the mobile shapes as they go by, but he isn't coordinated at 1 1/2 months and has only managed to hit the red one once. If he ever really does learn to grab the toys, the mobile will go into storage.Update: He is at 11 weeks now, and is still captivated by this mobile. If we play the music twice through, he'll start to get a little grumpy with it. We try to limit the number of times that we start it up in a given day, as he would probably watch it many times throughout the day. We are thinking that we should probably buy another, different, mobile, if just to give him a little variety."
127644,1,"This is a fantastic little crib. Granted, it will have a limited lifespan for my 20.5"" 6 month old. But, at present, he still fits with plenty of room to spare and I'm confident this crib will last through his first year. I initially purchased this crib for it's size and design. I prefer contemporary lines and natural wood. However, I didn't realize the portability of the crib would also come in handy. We were able to drag it from bedroom to bedroom as we moved the baby into our bedroom and then out again. We use the crib with the Da Vinci 50 coil mini crib mattress (I threw out the thin mattress pad the crib comes with)."
122915,1,This blanket is the only swaddle blanket that my son cannot wiggle his way out of. I highly recommend it. He is now sleeping 4-7 hours a night and is still swaddled when he wakes up. A must have for all new parents.
61021,2,We bought this just before our 13 month old was born. It has been a frustration from the very start. Now that we are expecting our second child we are actively looking for a better diaper system. I would not reccomend this diaper pail at all.
87188,2,"I purchased this item so my daughter would have a car seat when we flew home to visit my folks. Amazon delevired, it was there when I needed it, no problem. However as for the seat itself, the design and shape is crappy. When the child falls asleep in the seat it is not designed to properly support them, also the way that the seat belt goes through this particular seat is badly planned and I belive it hurts the childs back during a drive of longer than say 20 minutes. The seat is rather inexpensive but even free it would not have been worth the price. I suggest that you find a different seat with a better support design than what is offered here."
46671,2,"The handle on ours always sticks. Our son is high on the growth charts, but this carrier weighs a ton - 10 lbs in addition to the baby's weight - that's a lot. It's adorable, but if I had to choose again I'd go with another travel system."
166202,1,"I was reading some reviews and I had to agree with some negative opinions but only when it comes to ""runny"" poop. They do tend to leak when my baby has stomach problems but during regular days these diapers are really great. I was using swaddlers when she was little but they were much more expensive than baby dry so I gave baby dry a chance and they are ok. They don't leak even after all night ""sleep"" - they are very heavy in the morning but no leaks. Great diapers for a price. I would definetely recomend using them!"
129413,1,"It's hard to find toys that infants through toddlers enjoy. This is one of the items I purchased for use at my child care center and is probably one of the simplest and most used. Small infants can grasp it with problem and older infants through toddlerhood use it almost like a ball. It's brightly colored, holds up well to extended use, super easy to clean, and has a wide range of age interaction... and isn't over priced."
60777,1,"... You pop it in, tie a knot and your done. Some people told me to get the kind that use regular bags to save on refills. Refill are [a good price] each. My son is four months old and I'm on my 5th refill, so I think they last a decent amount of time. I can't imagine having to so frequently find and change the regular bags since they are so much smaller then a refill. The refills are scented plastic and I do not find they leak any oder. When the genie is closed there is no smell at all and if when you open it to remove the ""poop-sausage"" you get a little whiff, so what. You would get more then that with a trashcan and to be honest mine does not smell even inside when I'm changing it. I can't imagine having an trashcan full of poopy diapers in my nursery. The genie is sealed, no little fingers getting in, no puppies getting in. It is clean, hygenic, easy-to-use, cheap to upkeep and although I received it as a gift, I'd say for [the price] it was a steal."
177939,1,"Seems other reviewers (on the foogo without handles) has said this sippy cup leaks. My very active toddler twin boys have been man-handling these cups for the past 2 days without a single leak at all! I am very impressed! Love the hearty construction and rugged look. Too bad for my hardwood floors, however! Oh well, I guess with time, they'll learn to throw them gently :)Anyway - we have been using the Born Free sippys for the past 4 months and really do like them. However the lids keep cracking and they leak just like all other sippys, plus they sweat terribly. The foogos do not sweat at all, which is another bonus.Most importantly here - we are super glad for the safe plastic & metal construction (and will continue to use the Born Free as well).My ONLY complaint with these cups is that1) They are only 7 ounces and my guys drain these things rapidly. Seven ounces is not enough to get us by on ANY excursion.2) I don't know if it's easy to come by replacement parts, but the valve parts look like they will damage or get lost very easily.3) Wish they made a sport spout for when they grow out of the sippy phase. These cups are an investment $$ and appear they will last a long time. So it would be nice if the cup would grow with them rather than have to ditch it in a year. (plus I'd like to have one with a sport top for me as well!)Anyway - that's why the 4 instead of 5 stars. But I definitely recommend them.Oh, it is kind of a soft spout which is nice... I should mention, they will seep some water if your kids push down on the spout (like mine) to make the water come out on purpose. Otherwise when they are just laying around on my couch, carpet and hardwoods, they absolutley do not leak a drop!!We also tried the foogo straw cup. Nice, but they do leak when turned sideways... my boys aren't old enough for them yet. Maybe next year. Again, too bad the lids are not interchangeable, wish Thermos had thought this through. (And, Thermos,if you're listening... PLEASE MAKE A 10/12 ouncer!)"
11826,1,"I bought this for my son now 17 months when he first started on sold food. The old design was still in use then. He loved it. I put frozen banana slices or slices of cantelope in it when he was teething and he loved it. When the weather got warm, peices of popcycle where his favorite. It is a good idea to keep a backup in the diaper bag for when you're out and about. Now there is a new design, much easier to clean. I get the feeder and a refill pack for every new mother I know. It is a real life saver."
101180,0,The only thing that I was disappointed in was that these diapers didn't have the blue line wetness indicator. Otherwise the diapers did their job!
92481,1,Great. Arrived promptly as described. Fit craddle perfect. Great quality for low price.Exactly as explained
19439,1,"We used this for our son, who loved this. He was so comfortable and snuggling in his car seat and stroller. It was great! It kept him comfy.Great product!"
151786,1,Great basic colorCan't go wrong with this. Good quality for price. Would purchase again for sure. Cheapest price I found yet still good quality.
152553,1,I was so happy with my purchase that I bought one for my baby nephew.
7677,1,"Love the silky consistency of this soap. Does not lather a lot but it feels silky on the skin. Don't know how else to describe it. Soft, clean smell. And really moisturizes. I will continue to use this soap. I love Olivella products. It feels luxurious to use them even though they are reasonably priced."
100498,2,"We have been using Pampers sensitive ever since my son was born. When he turned one year old, Pampers sensitive doesn't work well during night time anymore and I was on a mission to find a good night-time diaper for him. I purchased Pampers Baby Dry (or should I call it Baby Wet?), all I can say is that it didn't work at all. We have to change diapers every 3 hours both in the day time and night time. Definitely a waste of money and we had to throw out half box of the unused ones.My 12-month-old boy usually sleeps through the whole night. It just hurt me so much when he was waken up by wet diapers and needed to take another 30 minutes to fall asleep again. Pampers Sensitive is the way to go for daytime, and for night time I happily found Huggies Overnite."
165488,1,"It seems to be the most flexible and comfortable on my little one's bum. The diapers do cost a few cents more than LUVs which seems to be the cheapest, but I still kept coming back to these because they are so well made.If you're looking for some advice on other baby registry essentials, check out AllMomsArePerfect dot com. You'll get the lowdown on what you really need and what you could save to buy later or avoid completely."
170293,2,"This seat looks nice and my 20 month old son is comfortable in it. However, last week as we were driving he reached down between his legs, lifted up the lever and lossened the shoulder straps. He is not a genius - any 20 month old child can do the same. I can't believe that BRITAX has not recalled this car seat"
147495,1,"This bouncer just arrived and in seconds my baby is sitting in it and loves it (there is no assembly). I've been wanting to buy this bouncer for a long time, but have resisted because of the price. After disliking other bouncers, I got this one and it's great. Worth the money. I like how easily can change to one of the many positions (from ""sleeping"" to ""sitting""). And no batteries to change. I wish I had bought it sooner. It is simple, looks good, my baby is small for her age (she is 5 months) and she looks extremely comfortable and likes the bears."
89355,2,"I, like many other reviewers, fell into the trap of buying these because they were going for a great price. My son had been wearing Huggies size 3, but I thought these might be worth a try. My husband and I now have a joke that our son has been crawling in the cobwebs again. These diapers fall apart and the fibers look like little spiderwebs hanging off his little bum. Sometimes we find our son plucking the ""webs"" off his diaper like someone plucking a chicken. I would not recommend these diapers, especially for active babies."
64626,1,"I love it! It's stylish, big enough but not too big, has a lot of great compartments and the changing pad is fantastic. I get a ton of compliments on it. Comfortable to carry, too."
171892,1,The sling is perfect for a newborn. Makes bath time easy. This tub also fits perfectly in our kitchen sink. Very happy so far!
69621,2,"Do not buy this playpen. Very poor quality, difficult to set up and pack down. Wife and I used this pen (the pink one) for about 3 weeks, then we could not get it to set up any more, one side support wouldn't click into place. Very dissatisfied, wish I could get my money back, avoid this at all cost."
86936,0,NICE SET OF BOTTLES BUT IF YOU HAVE A PREEMIE NEWBORN ITS KINDA HARD TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY REALLY ATE
150926,2,"Please be aware that this ""infant"" toothpaste has one enzyme derived from eggs and two enzymes from milk. I noticed my daughter was scratching her skin for the past week and it coincided with the use of this toothpaste. She is allergic to eggs. I called NUK about this and the representative agreed that their website has no warnings about this.The rep at NUK did say that the ""toddler"" toothpaste does not have these enzymes in the toothpaste but there is an oil derived from a tree nut. I can't confirm this but hopefully NUK and Amazon do a better job of posting the ingredients with the products.I gave this one star because of the lack of warning, not necessarily for the quality or performance of the toothpaste to actually clean teeth and gums.I hope this helps at least one parent out there."
47108,1,"I got this stroller for my 4 and 2 yr old. It works great and I think I should have bought it a year ago to get maximum use out of it. Also, the front seat is more suitable for a 1-1.5 old. I was looking for a light weight and compact stroller so this was the best choice I had. I have a graco and maclaren also. The maclaren is the best and it compares to graco ride-wise.I also got its cover from [...] for free which is a must if you want to use this stroller in rainy and cold weather."
77597,1,"I use this bag for bringing stuff to and from daycare, and it serves its purpose very well. It has 5 bottle sized pockets (counting two on the outside), two additional exterior pockets (one zip and one velcro) and a lot of room inside for clothes, blankets, bibs, etc. It is a large bag, the outer material is rugged but attractive (I have the Maya bag), and the interior contrasting material allows you to find things easily. I believe that this bag comes in two sizes as evidenced by the photos, and I do have the larger sized bag, I think it would be plenty big enough for most diaper bag purposes! Very pleased with the purchase and would recommend for an affordable basic diaper bag."
132953,1,"I love this system and don't see what the problem is with all the other reviewers. It is sooo easy to change the bag, and keeps the odor in just fine (although, I do have a breastfed baby, so maybe that makes a difference). And the refills are a lot cheaper than the diapers genie - one big reason why we went with it."
154758,2,"I ordered these because it was a good price. My daughter is older now, and is potty trained, so I don't use wipes as much as I used to. I still do use them some, to wipe feet, hands, face, etc. They are really thin and you have to use several to get things clean. Another thing, they stink. They are supposed to be unscented, but the smell bothers my daughter and she fights me every time I try to wipe her face, and she has never done that. There may be some who like these, but I won't buy these again."
97961,2,"I read about these bottles in a magazine and bought them to use for my newborn daughter. For my first child, I used the Dr. Brown's bottles and loved them; though I did not like washing the extra pieces. Since the concept here was similar and there weren't so many pieces to the bottle, I thought I'd try them. Big mistake! I tried them for 4 days. It took over an hour just to give her a bottle each time with this system. On the fourth day, 4 of the six nipples collapsed! It was ridiculous. A six pound newborn should not be able to do that to any nipple - never mind after only 4 days. Don't waste your money. I went back to the old reliable Dr Brown's bottles. They are the best and I decided that she was more than worth the few extra minutes it required to clean them."
182365,1,"This is the perfect length for both my change table and my not so little guy. The fact that it can be screwed to the surface was a big selling point for me. It may not be much, but its the extra security. Fits the American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Minky Dotted Fitted Contoured Changing pad cover PERFECTLY!"
105810,2,"I originally loved this product when I brought it home from the store, so much so that I gave it 5 stars after using it for 3 months. I even bought one for my brother after the birth of his son. Well here's the REAL DEAL... It worked quite well for about 4 to 6 months. However, now that I've had it for about 3.5 years, it's ""smellfully"" obvious it doesn't work as designed.I've removed it from the nursery and redeployed it to the guest bathroom. To handle the odor that leaks from the champ, I have use the following workaround. I've purchased Diaper Bags (Sassy Bags) from Wal-Mart/K-Mart and place every soiled diaper in the bag before depositing it into the Diaper Champ. Wet Diapers are placed in the Champ without having to be placed into a bag. Why does it leak odor? I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed. However, if you use the soiled diaper workaround I have suggested, it's a 4 or 5 star item because the diaper sac neutralizes the odor and the Champ keeps little hands from playing with the soiled diapers."
46906,1,"These wipes are expensive, but many times I will only have to use one, even for a big mess. With other wipes I will have to use 3 or 4, so actually they end up being not as expensive as you think. I think they are moister and smell better than other wipes."
60891,1,"The Diaper Genie I received is not like the ones seen on the internet. Mine is a plain white one. It does not have that cute purple top. Yet, this is the only model found in B-r-Us. The top has a cutter on it for easy disposal when only partially through the roll of bags. It is a quite impressive product. We use it regularly.You must read the instructions though. I had the product in my truck and ready to take back. Before taking it into the store, I went in and reviewed the model and its instructions. Now that I know how it works, it is a great product. I do enjoy the easy to release bottom. Just hang it over the trash bag, on trash pick-up day, and drop the bottom.While I cannot say if it is better than the competition, this is a good product. It lost a star due to the confusion, and mis-match of advertised product and actual one found in the store."
61313,2,"I absolutely HATE this thing! I don't even use it anymore. I hate it so much that I wouldn't even give it away! After reading that it was decent in Baby Bargains (my baby bible), I bought it. The cutting mechanism rarely works and it's just generally inconvenient. Spend the extra $5 on one of the competitors, I'm going to."
20052,2,"I bought one for my baby and it had an awful chemical smell to it. I wrote to the company and they responded ""I want to assure you that the product is non toxic and will not harm or hurt child. The product is made of Polypropylene (a foam used to make plastic). Sometimes as the plastic is being formed the chemical can seek out onto the outer surface causing a horrible smell."" They sent me a replacement that also smelled. I threw it out."
76847,1,"I recently bought this item and am SO HAPPY I did. After looking for a sunshade for my daughter I finally found the one. I went to Disneyland and I never had to worry about the sun shining on her face. It will come all the way down like a blanket would but you don't have to worry about it falling down with the ties it holds it in place, daughter napped and had the seat laying down and never any sun on her face. I'm very pleased with this brand of sunshade. My friend has the other shade that's popular on this site but that shade doesnt come down as far as this one does and she still has to put a blanket on it to keep the sun out of her son's eyes. I highly recommend this shade for all the mom's out their that like to be outdoors like I do!!!!"
39098,2,"I'm really glad I only bought three of these! They were so highly rated that I even bought the matching cover, but I did not like them at all. After only a couple of hours the diaper was soaked through and I mean through! The cover had to be washed as well since the diaper was so thoroughly soaked. That wasn't the worst, though, because I wouldn't mind changing her more often, but the wet was held against her skin all throughout the diaper, even above her legs at the snaps! No wicking at all and I know she was really uncomfortable. Plus at 10 lbs this diaper already seemed too small for her, or very soon would be. Don't waste your money- go for the Bum Genius with the free Super Saver Shipping- it's worth the extra $ by far."
140803,0,"These worked well for a while, but after a bit with the baby chewing on the nipple, the Y shaped hole got torn out until it would leak while it was being used. Also, be careful when using the small nipple brushes on these nipples, as they tended to pop through the Y-shaped hole, which would tear them out even further."
126559,1,"I have been using Huggies for my son since he was only a few months old, he is now 2 years old....and have never had any issues with leaking or anything!"
96588,1,This cover was just what the granddaughter ordered. It is warm and so easy to use. Mom loves it too. The seller was friendly and helpful when I called to find out where it was. Things from the west coast DO take longer via parcel post. Especially this time of year. We love it
128585,0,"When our Avent bottles started to get scratched and replacements were no longer available (BPA and all that), we decided to switch to glass.OK, these bottles are glass--that's good. Also, ours came with silicone nipples, also good (vs. latex). However, the rest of the bottle is an exercise in poor execution.1) The bottle is too small! All available formula mixes 240ml water/4 scoops formula, but these 8oz bottles simply don't have enough room for the water plus formula, so we're reduced to 180ml/3 scoops. The 4oz bottles will take two scoops just fine, so you're only gaining 50% in moving up to a supposedly double-sized bottle.2) They leak! Oh LORDY, they leak! Too tight, they leak. Too loose, they leak. Just exactly the right torque on the collar, and they might not leak, if you've got the lid slammed down as hard as possible. Of course then they won't vent.3) The nipple collapses quite easily, and is much slower to feed than it should be. This is partly related to the venting mentioned above, but it bears repeating.4) The opening is too small! OK, I know that this is a standard and the nipples/collars will fit on premixed bottles of formula, but it's a BAD standard! The Avent bottles were so much easier to pour formula into, in comparison.Why can't they (or anyone!) fix these things? The cheap plastic (BPA-free!) Gerber bottles are absolutely leak-proof. The Avent BPA-containing bottles are easy to fill and close to leak-proof at the collar, but have a terrible lid design (which melts just above boiling). The glass Evenflo don't vent, and leak all over. Haven't yet tried any of the others, but I don't see anything that meets all the criteria for a perfect baby bottle:1) Proper size2) Leak-proof3) Glass4) Silicone nipple5) Vents6) Simple design (which drops the Dr. Brown, from what I've seen)7) Idiot-proof (because who wants to mess around with getting a bottle _just_ right at 3:30am with a screaming baby on one arm?)8) Affordable - the small (5oz) Born Free bottles are FIFTEEN DOLLARS EACH locally! That's just ridiculous, folks.In short; They're decent, as good and bad as anything else out there, but not as good as they should be."
99550,1,"These Pampers have been the winners for our son - no leaks, super absorbent, easy to put on.The equivalent Huggies were a disaster - no matter how tight we put the Huggies on him, he managed to wriggle around and get some pee out of one gap or another. So he needed a new onesie for every diaper change....In cloth diapers, we have to change him as soon as he pees or poops, because the cloth diapers are not as absorbent. He's not used to the wet feeling, and he does NOT like it! So we use one cloth diaper a day, just to give him a break / change of pace.If not for these Pampers, our lives would be a lot less pleasant right now."
145315,1,"My five month old daughter loves this bouncer! She has so much fun bouncing, playing with all of the toys, looking at all of the lights and listening to the rainforest animals as she bounces. I can not think of a better item to purchase for an infant 5+ months old."
26518,2,"We loved the style and functionality of this bassinette! The underneath shelf held a small trash can, diapers, wipes, a change of clothes, extra sheets...everything you need for middle of the night changes without leaving the room. Unfortunately, we returned the bassinette because the locking mechanism for the rocker did not completely immobilize the bed. This created 2 serious problems...1. Because the locking mechanism didn't lock the bed in place the bed shifted at the slightest movement which provoked the startle reflex in our little girl...I finally discovered this after about 2 sleepless weeks and then sitting up to watch her to find out why she was screaming after we put her down sound asleep. 2. Our daughter rolled from back to side from day one home, and the first night we put her to sleep in it that she actually slept, I woke up in the middle of the night to find her face against the side because the bed shifted with her weight even though it was the locking mechanism was on.Bottom line- If the company would improve the locking mechanism, this would be a great purchase."
52676,1,"This was somewhat of an indulgent purchase for me for our second child but what an awesome item. Our baby from the moment we took him home has absolutely loved this papasan. He has eaten, slept in and just about anything else in it! It is so soft and snugly and supports your baby's body and head beautifully. Also, it folds up so easily for travel. I would recommend this to everyone who is about to have a baby. You'll love this item!"
169579,1,"I bought this as mine and my husbands diaper bag. I wanted to get something that he would be ok with carrying around... but as it turned out he rarely carried it since we mostly went places while he was working. I thought that it did the job, but I still had trouble getting everything to fit and stay organized there. It would have been nice if there were more pockets and compartments on the inside, otherwise everything was just dumped into the same area. Since I realized that it was mine, instead of ours, I ended up going with a more stylish Coach diaper bag that could later serve as a giant purse. If we ever have another baby the Diaper Dude will be a spare bag that will stay in my husbands car."
154045,2,"Odd scent, small and wimpy wipes. For poopy diapers you'll need at least three. Love 7th Generation diapers, but moving on from the wipes."
156931,0,I had heard so many great things about this ultrasaucer while I was pregnant. You have to be careful though because many of the toys are quite sharp. My 5 month old has hit his head and scratched his face numerous times on the toys.
74997,1,"Great if used in an archway or doorway - definitely not a good buy for the top of the stairs as it can be moved if pushed hard enough. Fairly easy to assemble and to adjust to fit many opening sizes. I am happy with my purchase, and even more thrilled that I did not have to spend $50+ to get what I needed."
99755,1,"Excellent deal! Buying diapers can get real expensive! I usually dont buy this brand but, the price couldnt be beat! It's always great to save money on essentials!"
155058,1,"These diapers are great and really work great at night. Now that my baby has just started sleeping through the night I didn't want to have to worry about a leaking diaper waking him up or having to change him in the middle of the night. These diapers work great and get us through until morning. My only comment is that I would recommend checking the size of these diapers. They say they'll fit up to 28 pounds, but my baby is only 20 pounds and I feel like they're already getting a little on the small side for him."
105528,0,"I was very happy with the Diaper Champ for a long time. I loved being able to use regular garbage bags, changing the bags was easy, and easy to empty. Very simple to put the diapers in. We did have to replace the sponge ""gaskets"" twice before putting the Diaper Champ to the curb. Once our child was on table foods this diaper pail does not work anymore! Even with cleaning it and letting it air out for a day. It literally made the whole house stink!So out to the curb it went and got something else. There is absolutely no smell w/ the different diaper pail."
140688,0,I was disappointed with the smell. I don't wear perfume because it makes me sick and the smell of this product is like cheap perfume. It just didn't feel like a natural/organic product on my skin. This is not worth the price.
121810,1,Arrived in time for the baby shower! I wish I had invented these simple little pillows! They are awesome--the fabric is nice/pretty and very very cute!!! No matter what pattern you order you will love it.
28481,1,"We bought the Cherry with Beige Cushion, and we love it! I found the similar item in Babies R Us for $180, and it is still not nearly as good as this one.It is very EZ to assemble (10 minutes), and looks and built quality are also very good. Sturdy!"
131857,1,just started using the seat last week...everything seems fine...the only thing i am concerned about is the crotch strap. my son is 7 months old and is 30 inches and is already using the furtherest slot of the crotch positioner (there are 3 slots). just hope to get some good use out of the seat...
71207,1,"Easy to assemble and very versatile rocker for baby. The baby loves it, at 6 weeks old she can rock herself , and baby can take a nap in it .Glad I purchased it."
117341,1,"I purchased one of these to keep my pets out of the master bedroom. It worked so well that I bought a second one for another bedroom and have just ordered a third for yet another doorway.In the past to keep the pets out of those areas we just kept the doors to the rooms closed, but that messes up air circulation for the heating and air conditioning. With the pet gates the pets stay out and the air conditioner works much better in those rooms! The one caveat to this is we have one cat who has learned to jump over the gate, but he's really not the ""problem pet"" so we're okay with his acrobatics.The gate is well built and easy to install. The ""trick"" to installing it -- if you can actually call it a trick -- is to read the instructions! Measure the door opening and refer to the instructions for that opening size and it will show you which pieces you'll need for that particular opening size.It does help if you have someone hold the gate in place as you start tightening the tension bolts that hold it in the doorway, but all your helper has to do is stand there and hold it for 60 seconds and, then, they're done.When I installed the second gate it actually took me longer to get it out of the box and remove all the packing materials from the gate and the hardware -- it's packed well -- than it did to install it.I highly recommend it!"
66047,0,"I think Dr. Brown bottles work well and I bought them because they came recommended from many friends of mine, saying that they would reduce gas and fussiness with my baby. With that said, I'm not sure if she would have had a lot of gas or not with other bottles. The bottles have worked fine for her and she doesn't have that much gas but, they are annoying because of all the little parts and pieces that you have to 1)keep up with and 2)wash. If I had it to do over, I would go with a more simple design, with a top, nipple and that's it. Oh, and remember, if you buy the 4 oz, you are going to have to eventually buy the 8 oz bottles, so why waste your money?"
49594,1,"Very good product. One at my daughter's home, one at my office for two babies that come to work with their Mom. Easy to take up and down, not too heavy, folds neatly away in a corner. Good quality material."
144825,1,"We have been really happy with this mattress! It has held up really well for both our kids and they have both slept well on it, so I'd say it must be really comfortable too. The mattress is thick and provides just the right amount of firmness that I wanted for my kids. I also like that the company is eco-friendly and receives a lot of safety accolades--I felt very comfortable buying from this company."
17111,2,I received this monitor for a shower gift. No matter where I put it I can't get a picture. I called the company and they want me to ship it back to them and they will ship me another one. I hope the new one works after reading the reviews it seems like they have some sort of problem with the monitors. It's very dissappointing.
130098,1,I received this swing at my baby-shower from my aunt and cousin (mother of 3 under 3yrs) and I have to say it is my son's favorite thing next to nursing! He enjoys swinging in both directions and actually chooses which direction he prefers. Most of the time he's swinging side-ways but he does like going back/forth every once in a while.At about 2 1/2 months old he began to be interested in the lights and music as well and then decided he wanted to start sleeping in the swing during the night. He hates his crib and was sleeping with my husband and I but now I feel much better with him in the swing.He's almost 4 mos old and still sleeps through the night in the swing. He takes his naps there as well. He doesn't have much use for the tray but I think that's only because when he's in the swing he's sleeping not playing.We were going through batteries like you wouldn't believe so I went to RadioShack and they helped me with getting an AC adaptor and now it runs on electricity instead of batteries. It cost me $20 but saved me hundreds in the long run.This swing has been a life saver and I don't know what I'm going to do without it once my son is too big to be in it.I will make sure I have one for any and all children I have in the future.
136461,1,"I received this product (Beatrice Tower) sooner than I ever thought and I was pleased with that part. When assembling the product, it was easily assembled until we got to assembling the drawers and realized that the sides of the drawers were all for the left side and none for the right side! I called the manufacturer's number that was on the instruction sheet and they have agreed to send the correct sides for the drawer assembly. Hopefully, I will get them soon so my new granddaughter will be able to have this beautiful piece of furniture in her room. The wood had a few dings and knicks on it, but like others before me have written, I plan on using a black magic marker for that part. Otherwise, I am sure we will enjoy this product and it will be a great addition to my granddaughter's room whenever I finally get the correct parts! The price was very acceptable, so I hate to complain too much!"
156088,1,"I've now bought 4 of these. They're excellent teething toys. Little kids who are teething, are also at the age where they are learning to grasp and manipulate. This takes advantage of it, and the clash of colors is mentally exciting to a young kid."
178204,2,"I chose these bags partly because of the reviews that I read on this website and because they made economic sense. I gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed. I have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply. However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom. I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place. My solution was to use bottles. They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice."
18810,0,"I searched and searched for the perfect umbrella style double stroller for my girls, now 2 and 11 months. I really thought I had found it in this stroller and was so excited to get it and try it out.I liked the idea of the ""room to walk"" wheel, as my husband in particular always has issues with his feet hitting the wheels on strollers. And I liked the idea of the center handlebar. But, all in all, this stroller just didn't work for us. First of all, it does not fold down as compactly as I had hoped. Because we drive a sedan (a 2004 Passat), I needed something that would fit in the trunk but not take up the entire thing. This did fit in the trunk, but with very little room for anything else. I also thought that in comparison to others I have seen, this stroller is pretty heavy. That isn't a huge issue for me, as the majority of the time you are pushing a stroller, not carrying it. Also, the steering I found to be awkward. It was well balanced with the weight difference (my 2 year old is 31 pounds and my 11 mth old is 21 lbs), but I felt that a wider handlebar would have eased steering immensely. The biggest factor for me though was that this stroller has fairly narrow seats and my 2 year old hated being in it. (and she is a child who loves to stroll)It does have some very nice features too, but ultimately we ended up returning it and going with the Chicco Twin C5-which we love.Pros:-cupholders, which are a rare find-the canopies are very full and nice-looks wise, it is a very attractive stroller-it is very sturdy and seems like it would withstand a lot of use-the room to walk wheel does make the stride a lot nicer, for both me (at 5'5"") and my husband (at 6'3"")-weight limits of 55lbs per seat-this was a big selling point for me, as my kids are both tall and heavy for their agesCons:-it does not fold very compactly-steering can be difficult because of the narrow handle bar-narrow seats-a personal con for us, that our daughter hated it-the baskets have a cross bar on top of the actual basket-it was designed this way, but I think it makes the baskets much more difficult to use (and they are not user friendly as it is)All in all, it is a great concept that could use just a little tweaking. I loved some of the things about this stroller, but it just did not end up working for us. And while the Chicco Twin C5 is not nearly as sturdy as this one, it has worked out perfectly for us-it is tall enough for my husband, fits well in the trunk of our car, the kids love it and it handles beautifully. For someone who is looking for something nice on a bit of a friendlier budget, that is a fantastic stroller option."
5777,1,"My husband and I originally bought the safety first pack of outlet covers (which my son figured out in 2 seconds flat, and then thought it was seriously funny to remove every one he could find) for a higher cost. We were fortunate enough to have a relative give us a few of this brand of covers to use in the play area that he could NOT remove. We are having a second baby at the end of November and one of my first buys was this product to cover the rest of the house!They are a little difficult for adults to pull out (yes, especially on newer outlets), but that's what is needed for tiny fingers! Would recommend these over any other brand so far!"
127892,2,The brush is stiff and I feel I have to force it in the bottle. The bottles I use are the 5oz medela and the evenflo glass bottles.I also feel like it doesn't generate a lot of suds. I definitely cannot use to clean the medela breastshield. The brush is too stiffto fit inside and clean it throughly.
67500,0,"We bought this about two months now and my son loves riding in it and often falls asleep in it. However, it is not at all comfortable to lug on your back. I tried it onces and my shoulders and back hurt so much. My husband uses it all the time for my son, but after 45 minutes, his back and shoulders hurt too. We should have spent some extra money and bought a better one."
171782,1,"This baby tub has worked great. It fits in my kitchen sink and also works perfectly in our bath tub. I orginally had been given another tub, but the other tub would scrape my baby's feet, I always had to be so careful.I have had no complaints with this tub. I am looking forward to using the hammock feature with my baby who is due October 1, 2006. I like both the infant and toddler orientations of this tub. My 16 month old daughter still sits comfortable in the toddler position. This tub makes bath time a breeze. To drain it, I use the drain that is included, then I turn it upside down to get any remaining water out of it. I've never had any problems with mildew or anything. This tub is also a great value. I recommend it to any parent with an infant or toddler."
77390,1,"We bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months old, and I am so sorry I didn't buy this earlier. It's the cutest thing, it's sturdy, the music is either upbeat or soothing (whichever you prefer), and my daughter loves the butterflies and the lights. I wish they made an adult version! I'd buy it all over again, definitely a great baby shower gift."
158997,1,"I am a first time mom and my husband and I had no IDEA how expensive these things would be. We never tried any carriers on until we got this one. We had registered for it based on the look and feel of the material. I love it for hands free shopping. I never used it much around the house, but did notice in the stores that the straps slip a little. Nothing dangerous in my opinion. I was never annoyed by it and the slip seemed VERY gradual,nothing a minor, easy adjustment wouldn't fix. My son was 10 lbs. the first time we put him in it and now he is almost 7 months old and weighing 20. All in all, we are happy with the carrier and the price in comparison to the other carriers. :o)"
183036,2,"I was thrilled when I found this stroller on-line, however I was very disappointed when I received it. I wanted something lightweight and easier. It is. However, my one-year-old son doesn't fit! The stroller is too narrow for him and also not deep enough for him. His shoulders are squished together and he looks so uncomfortable in it. It also looks like he's going to slide off of the way too shallow seat! Unless you have a VERY TINY child, I would not recommend this stroller at all."
37316,1,Love this bag. It fits on my new stroller really well easy clip onto the handles. Excellent value for money. The only negative is that it is a bit bigger then I thought and I am a 1 diaper bare essential type of Mum however not really a problem.
162859,1,"I had been looking for a product for when we're driving that won't get the snack all over the place. This does pretty well at keeping it contained; sometimes there are still goldfish crackers in my 2yr old daughter's carseat - but that's more because of her and not the container! This does the best job that I could find - an open container just does not work! The only thing ""negative"" is that is does seem to ""scrape"" her fingers. And I hesitate to even say ""scrape"" because it's not a true scrape, but after using this her fingers are red and raw. Other than that it's a pretty useful product."
180209,1,"The main problem I have is this: I have used the pump about 8-10 times, and it is losing suction. It seems to be the diaphragm assembly in the handle that is leaking air, but purchasing a replacement diaphragm assembly (Medela Harmony Diaphragm, Puller and O-Ring Assembly #8007234) is nearly half the cost of the whole pump. I am planning to purchase a different brand of manual pump. [edit: I have since learned that you should expect to replace each pump part monthly. I used mine with original parts for almost three months. ]I like the simple design of this pump, and I find it fits my hand comfortably. I had some difficulty finding the right amount of pressure to apply to be comfortable and still get milk flow. However I eventually figured out that I needed to purchase a different size of Personal Fit breast shield (Medela PersonalFit Small 21 mm Breastshields, 2-pk), which made it much more comfortable to use.The SoftFit breast shield it comes with does warp if steam-sterilized in the microwave bags (Medela Quick Clean Micro-Steam Bags). All the other pieces seem to steam-sterilize and run through the dishwasher just fine (including the Personal Fit breast shields). There are a couple of small pieces that could easily be lost down one's disposal in the sink, so I bought sparesMedela Valves & Membranes. The simple design makes it easy to put together and break down, even in a dimly lit room(I have used it mostly at night)."
72169,1,"We have one with slightly different toys, but... My son is 11 months old and loves this toy! Recently the piano broke, so I called the customer service number and they are sending me a new piano, no questions asked and no charge! Great customer service!The only ""negative"" thing I have to say is that without the seat, the table is tippy. My son isn't walking independently yet, and if he tries to hang onto the table to stand, he can easily pull it over. The seat will stay attached until he is walking."
143692,0,"I purchased this shade to put on the front seat of my double stroller, as the shade up there is a a joke....The connections on the Kiddopotomus are not designed for that sort of use and it was too awkward to be useful. It is now in a heap in the front entry way and I am considering a clip on umbrella for the toddler in the front of my Graco, but I gave it 3 stars anyway as it looks like it would do what it says it will on a single stroller that already has a largish shade to support the extra sunshade....and yes I know that it says it is for a single stroller, but there doesn't appear to be one designed for a ""single file"" type double stroller!"
37919,1,"I love this stroller! Great price and good quality. The only possible downside to be aware of is that the front wheel is fixed.If you are a real avid runner I would recommend a different stroller. Otherwise this is definately a good purchase!It breaks down easily and fits in the back of a car well. It is easy to push and unlike other strollers, my kids can't bug each other in their own seats."
182844,0,"Tried to add Huggies Newborn ro my Baby Registry, but the only option I get is to add it to a Wedding Registry. Does this make sense?"
121880,1,"This cover is great and we use it every day with our daughter. It really is quite warm - when our daughter is in the Bjorn her front side stays toasty, and this cover really keeps the heat in so we don't have to overdress her. In cold weather we just put on her jacket and a hat, and then this cover makes everything toasty. I only wish we could use it longer, as she's getting too tall!"
25143,1,"I am glad I purchased this made-to-fit screen for the Bob Stroller. This screen is primarily used for the mosquitos that occupy our Minnesota landscape. It fits very snuggly on the stroller unlike the generic one we have for our Graco stroller.Construction is very durable and should easily last for quite a few years as long as it is stored properly when not on the stroller. If it does rip; I believe this could be sewed,glued, or patched fairly easily.Definitely would purchase again."
64717,1,"Very happy with this purchase! My baby girl, Isabella, just loves these toys and plays with them daily. She has been playing with them since she was 4 months old and she is now 9 months and still gets excited when using them. They are colorful and easy for babies to handle. They are easy to clean and very durable. Highly recommend purchasing!"
35077,0,"I don't understand why Amazon or Babies R Us won't post a pic of the travel system AND the car seat. I registered in the store before the single stroller was available. I absolutely loved the car seat (so buttery soft!), but was told the travel system wasn't available yet. It's now available, but can't be purchased on-line, only in the store. Why not post a picture on-line and add &quot;only available in stores&quot; so that those of us who can't just trot down to the closest store on a whim, can actually SEE the item we're interested in. Also, my on-line registry (for those family &amp; friends who are out of state) doesn't list this item until the very end with the other 'in-store only' items which, again, doesn't show pictures. End result rating? Product: (car seat - 5) Customer Service: 2 Needs work, guys."
93051,1,"I liked this very much. Works very well in limited space and stores nicely. Unfortunately, I thought my grandson was old enough to stay on it, and go to sleep. I don't recommend this for a child who still needs confining. Get a crib or playpen instead."
113600,0,"Am happy overall with the product but was very disappointed to find that on the white tray (the one my baby would be eating off of) that there is a large section right in the middle that looks totally scratched... like someone took an abrasive scouring pad and washed/scratched it. Maybe the product was used by someone but then returned? I wish the returns department had inspected the item more carefully so that I wouldn't have to pay full price for a ""used"" (not ""like new"") item. I don't feel like it is worth the cost and effort of sending the product back for a new one, oh well."
19480,0,My 14 month old son didn't think much of this although he's in love with other Pablo toys. The pillow is not that cuddly as the face portion is a bit too hard. Just another plush toy - not a pillow.
175114,1,"Oh this was SUCH a lifesaver for my oldest daughter! It was so nice to have for her until she was really steady and ready to be in the bathtub. Plus, it doesn't require a ton of water. I can't wait to use it again with my new baby, she's 4 months old, so we'll be using it soon I'm sure!"
29184,0,"Overall the stool is not bad. Unfortunately, it is not tall enough. My son is 2 1/2 and is considered big for his age. When he sits on the toilet his feet do not sit flat on the stool. The stool is to small to use at the sink. I am sure it will be fine when my son gets a little bigger. Right now, not so great."
156723,1,"I really don't care what wipes I use. I'm a veteran mom of 3 so I can use one wipe where it would take my hubby 5. However, he uses less of these!I like the texture, it scrubs a lot better than the others I've used for when the kids do a...proffesional job! ;)The only thing I don't like is they do not tear in half, they have threads running through it that really won't allow it."
26074,0,"It looks great, but in our Subaru was impossible to level. Trip to a car seat safety seminar elicited the info these are designed for European cars, with flatter seats. Solution was a chunk of swim noodle under the base at fold of car seat (the installation manual gives no help on this - it suggested loosening the harness - ouch.) I also have trouble getting the carrier out of the base without violent shaking. Baby won't be here for 3 more weeks, but I suspect this will be a problem! (...) but I still wish we'd bought the easier Graco."
177195,1,"I received this as a gift before our baby was born, and we love it. It is sturdy enough and I love oak, so I chose this along with the oak chest. It had plenty of space for everything and now that she is too big for the top to be a changing table, I just took off the strap and pad and the top holds lots of her pretty things and we put stuffed animals on the shelves. I would recommend it."
121410,1,I'm so happy we found toy hammock. It's been a great way to keep my baby's stuffed animals out of the reach of our dog. I haven't had to use the toy chain as of yet...but I'm sure it'll be just as useful as the one I had growing up.
139041,0,"The stars project on the ceiling much larger than I expected. It would also be wonderful if it played some type of soothing music, waves, etc."
24680,1,"This gate is great. It is very easy to install and once installed it takes the abuse kids give it (pull and push on it, etc). My 4 year old can open it by jumping on the foot pedal (I'm sure that is not recommended)and the gate doesn't budge from the wall. My toddler, however, cannot open it no matter what she tries. I highly recommed this."
143750,1,This product is very warm and cozy. Its been quite useful for our newborn. If you are looking for something afordable for a carseat cover this is your product.
19263,1,This works well in the carseat and keeps my baby from slumping in the seat.
46505,0,I am using this bedrail on a bed with a slat roll not a box spring but it would not fold flat no matter what bed I put it on. It is very easy to put together and does not budge when I lean on it in the bed but it does not fold down to make changing the sheets any easier!
117575,1,"Baby loves this, she's been using it since she was 6 months old and still wants to bounce in it, even though she is getting too old for it at 13 months! Definitely one of the best baby items we have - worth every penny. There are so many useless baby items, this isn't one of them."
70146,2,"The set is very pretty, however, the quality is lacking.My biggest problem has been with the bumper. The seams and ties do not seem to be positioned properly--they do not match up with the four corner posts of the crib railing. I started it in all different corners, different positions on the back railing, and even upside down--and those ties were never in all four corners! So, I ended up removing ties from the toy bag and adding ties to the bumper. Also, once tied, the bumper is VERY flimsy and sags. It looks much better in pictures than in my daughter's crib.The diaper stacker doesn't have any boning or wire edging to help it keeps its shape. It looks a little ragged hanging on the wall."
72261,1,"Our baby loves this activity center. He started using it around 5 months when his feet barely touched the ground. Now, at almost 8 months he cruses around the circle. When my other nephews come over they even have fun playing with the piano and other activities! I am happy to know I can take the seat off and use this center as my son gets older instead of just another toy to give away after a few months of use. Great buy - I would encourage others to try. My only suggestion is that I wish the seat had one more height adjustment. My son is tall and I already have the seat adjusted to the highest place. But he still loves it and has great fun with it."
126267,0,"These are size 1 diapers. the next size available on Amazon is Size 3. Just because the package says Size 1-2 doesn't make these any bigger. So, I am back to buying diapers at the grocery store again after my daughter grew out of the size 1 (she is not yet in the size 3).I love these diapers. I just wish size 2 was available."
110922,1,My son only has his first two bottom teeth and loves this thing. It serves a dual purpose by also brushing his teeth. Great Item
165862,2,"These diapers are terrible, they leak and make my baby smell like urine. I thought I ordered the same pampers as before which were the swaddlers, No these are not and they are very different. These diapers are blue in color and are just as bad as huggies. i love the Pampers Swaddlers my girls can go all night and not have any problems."
170355,0,"I bought the Britax Marathon because I was impressed with the built in lock-offs. We don't have LATCH in one of our cars and we need to use the seat belts. A colleague at work demonstrated to me how easy it is to install the Marathon using the seat belt clamping devices that are built into the seat. In forward facing mode the seat installs very quickly and easily, maybe even easier than a LATCH installation.While the lock-offs are a dream come true in forward facing mode, they are a nightmare when the seat is rear facing. The seat comes with two sets of lock-offs, the forward facing and rear facing lock-offs. They have different designs. When the seat arrived I attempted to install it in rear facing mode according to the instructions. To my astonishment, the rear facing lock-offs would just POP OPEN by themselves! Sometimes I would close the lock-off and it would pop open right away. Sometimes I would close it and it would hold a little a while, then pop open later when I was checking the snugness of the installation. I could never close them in such a way that they wouldn't pop open later. It goes without saying that this was unacceptable, since with the lock-off open the seat would be free to fly around in the car in a crash.I called Britax about the problem and the representative was not surprised by my report and matter-of-factly told me there was no way to prevent the lock-offs from opening. Her recommendation was to use the locking mechanism on the seat belt itself. I had been down that road with our infant seat and know personally how difficult it is to get a tight installation using just the seat belt mechanism. I asked her about using a locking clip (the flat metal piece that is used to hold two belts together) and she said that Britax does not provide those so she can't recommend them. Further the Britax website says to use the built in lock-off instead of a locking clip.All this information gave me a tough decision to make. I loved the seat in forward facing mode but couldn't get a safe rear facing installation without a locking clip, which the manufacturer doesn't recommend. In the end I went with the locking clip. I had the installation inspected by a certified inspector and with some changes the installation was deemed safe.All of this took several days and was a major hassle. I would have been in better shape if the rear facing lock-offs weren't there in the first place. Even when you don't use them they are a nuisance because they are in the way. I only stuck it out with this seat because our daughter only needs to ride rear-facing for three more months.I am amazed that the lock-offs spontaneously opening isn't reason enough for a product recall. Britax could easily fix them with a better design.Overall my rating is 5 stars for forward facing and 1 star for rear-facing, which averages to 3. If you have LATCH, or you intend to only use the Marathon in forward facing mode, then I recommend this seat. If you intend on using the seat in rear-facing mode with seat belts, then be wary of the lock-offs!"
8555,1,"When my son was learning to crawl I bought this to protect him and it has saved his head a couple of times. We put it on the top of the coffee table and the bottom self of the coffee table as well. I also have some antique book shelves that I put it on. Yes it comes off, but if they made the tape stronger they would have people mad because it was ruining their furniture. It is not that big of a deal to reapply it. It does come with a bit of extra tape. I love it, and would buy more if I needed it."
80453,1,"I bought this for my 7 month old and it's been great. I like that it comes with toys attached and the seat belt strap too so that I don't have to use the dirty grocery store ones. I also like that it can be used over high chairs because those restaurant high chairs can be REALLY dirty sometimes. It also cushions the seats for my baby. She likes to ride in the shopping cart with this and my older daughter likes to play with it too. I also love the little storage bag that it comes with, it's so convenient and it looks nice too! I love it and highly recommend to anyone with small children. ;)"
75033,1,"We bought a seat for our son to mirror the same product bought for our daughter several years earlier. This seat is fantastic and has served us well for nearly 4 years, however as our son has recently GROWN so fast (!) he no longer needs the head support. Both kids loved the fact they could fall asleep and their heads didn't slump over. Downside was wearing the bulky headphones that come with your minivan or SUV because as they get older their head doesn't fit as well and they asked regularly for the video audio to be played on the car stereo ... by then it was time for their own portable DVD and MP3/iPod players anyway. Well worth the price, they'll make good hand-me-downs to somebody! Don't hesitate - just buy Britax."
110924,1,"I love it and my son loves it. It fits perfectly with his mouth, and is easy for him to hold. It's 100% silicone, so nothing can hurt his mouth. I also found that when he is having a bad teething day, if I rub a little bit of his teething gel on it, it really helps. He would chew on it all day if I let him:)"
76660,1,"Safe, lightweight, solid styling, and child-approved. My daughter was so excited about what was originally purchased as an extra vacation booster option that she nos favors the Combi booster over her more permanent full-size booster. This booster was easy to travel with and provided the safety and security I was looking for. We enjoyed other Combi products when my daughter was an infant and it's great to see our brand usage expand through the years."
133320,1,"My son has been using Dr Brown's bottles since he was born and I have been reading about BPA free bottles and wanted to switch. I tried the Gerber cheaper BPA free bottles but they have no ventilation system and even trying many different types of nipples, my son would not take them at all. He hated them. So I ordered the Born Free and he loves them! No problem at all switching from Dr. Brown to these, they have a great ventilation system and they also have a nipple (i got size 3) that works well for him (even though it's completely different than the dr. brown one). These bottles are easier to clean and have less parts as well. I'm so thrilled to find a BPA free bottle he'll take, it's worth the price."
69478,2,"Normally the diapers are great. However, over the past year and from multiple stores - including 4 boxes we just bought on Amazon - we have had issues with the Economy Pack (or whatever it's called). At least half, if not more, of the diapers are defective and my children wake up in the morning with the little absorbing beads all loose, the diaper split open, and a big giant mess. Not to mention a real pain to clean up. We still use these Cruisers, but we buy them in the smaller packs, not this Economy Pack."
2797,1,"I don't have children yet, but my profession is a photographer, and with infants so little it's sometimes hard to get them in a perfect pose, the boppy is a great tool to get a natural look, you can cover it with a blanket to match whatever you want, so next time you go to get those special memories captured, bring along your boppy and introduce your favorite photographer to the boppy, ( i also prop it up a little if they are on a table, and the camera is fixed ie jcpenney or sears) Congrats to all and many smiles!!!"
65683,1,"This product is great, but if you use them on the hinge side of the door, and you have little kids that will try to force the door closed, it will destroy your hinges.We use them on the other side of the door to prevent the door from clicking closed, and it leaves just enough space so fingers don't get pinched. Used this way, we LOVE them."
121851,2,I wonder how it gets so many reviews..This just doesn't stay in place while nursing..You have to keep adjusting..I wish I had not wasted money on this..A normal pillow is much better.
103693,0,"I like the purpose and quality of these wipes. However, I find it annoying that these wipes are INDIVIDUALLY wrapped. That was not listed in the product description. I prefer them to be in the resealable package. Less waste and cost. I will only buy the Medela resealable wipes in the future for use with my pump accessories."
130071,1,"The swing is one of the nicer ones. It is a little fast for a newborn, but if you are near your baby, you can slow it down until the baby is a bit bigger. I ended up having to purchase it at a local store because the one delivered from Amazon was damaged.It is great if your baby has a bit of colic. The motion is very soothing to the tummy."
140587,1,"I had this on my registry after reading good reviews. I got it for my shower so it was ready to use when I brought the baby home from hospital.He is three months old now and we use it alot. We have set it up between my computer and my husbands. He spends time in it when we are working at our computers.I never thought the ability to change the way it swings would matter, but apparently it does, my son has a definite preference for swinging side to side rather than back and forth. So that feature turned out to be very handy.He really enjoys the mobile. It hangs at a good height for him to see.The big reason for choosing it was the fact it didnt have to run off batteries. So we have it plugged into the wall and never had to even put batteries into it.Only things I would improve would be the following:A longer cord.The tray should be easy to remove.The other thing to keep in mind, is its not very portable. So if that is a feature you are looking for keep that in mind. We were not, we had a set place for this in mind.We have other rainforest items. It seems like a good set to get. Nice and vibrant colours for the babies to enjoy."
72788,2,"This product had a range of about 10 feet before starting to get interference and terrible buzzing, making it impossible to hear the baby over the noise. I returned it after 2 days!"
74357,1,"I read reviews about this product being top-notch, and bought it. I totally am satisfied, it is very high quality and I would strongly recommend it to others."
83809,1,"This is one of the coolest products out there for messy eaters at restaurants. It's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and you know that the surface is clean enough to eat off. Just unroll it and use the suction cups to keep it attached. Your child can't pull it off the table and the little ""crumb catcher"" at the bottom helps keep things from falling in their laps or onto the floor. Use this and your servers at restaurants will love you! When you're finished, just pop it off, brush off the food and roll it up. The hardest part is to remember to bring it in and clean it up in a sink before your next outing.We have used the Tiny Diner since our little girl was old enough to start eating out with us. Whenever people see our daughter using it, they always come up to us and say, ""What a great idea! Where did you get that?"" We tell them that we got it at Target, but they don't sell them there any more. I am glad to see that you can purchase it through Amazon!I strongly recommend this for any parent with finger-food eating kids or for a parent-to-be. It might be hard to find at retail stores, so it would be a great baby shower present as well."
95616,1,"I love this hammock. It holds all of my daughters stuffed animals which weighs about 10 lbs. I highly recommend it. I would say the only down fall is that it quit big but, that's why they call it Jumbo. Also, it looks a bit dominating of her bedroom but, its better then having her toys on the floor."
2064,1,"I used these diapers before my son crawled, then, after he began crawling, used Pampers Cruisers. He began getting diaper rash. I went back to Pampers Baby Dry, and NO MORE DIAPER RASH!! I love these diapers, and I love getting them from Amazon. The come right to my door, and are less expensive than in the store. The only thing is I wish you could change shipping dates, instead of skipping a whole month."
22688,1,I bought this to keep at my house for when my grandson visits. I bought an extra 3&#34; pack n play mattress to go inside which makes it much more comfortable for him when he spend the night.
181642,1,"I saw this bag and thought it looked great. It has a cell phone pocket on the strap which is easy to grab. Its a great size. not a huge bulky diaper bag, but large enough for me to fit my sons things as well as a few crucial things from my purse. we shared it. I loved it.The only problem I have with this bag is, at the corner of the bag, where the strap is sewn into it, it started to rip. I now have a hole in the corner of my bag."
121398,0,"This was a gift for my 5 month old son. He was mesmerized with it at first sight, even while we were taking it out of the package! He enjoys playing with the toys and is able to scoot around backwards (so far).The drawbacks are that the colors are sort of bland. The height is not adjustable, so babies will either not fit in it or grow out of it fast. And lastly, I have the same problem with the walker simply falling apart. So far, the right leg is strong enough to keep the walker up, but the left leg collapses no matter how little pressure you put on it. Yes, it was assembled with care and the leg snaps into place, but it falls anyway.The only thing that I like is the seat is small enough for his long and skinny body. He is not able to sit up by himself yet, so this offers good support. I had another where the seat was large and he would fall forward and hit his face on the front of the seat.It gets 3 stars only because my son loves it (but what toys do babies not love?) and it fits his little body, for now."
164592,1,I love these diapers for the money. They are great and don't leak! I have two in diapers and cannot tolerate leaking. These do the trick!
28089,1,"These wipes are the only ones I use now - fresh but not perfumy, thick washcloths - great product!"
157925,1,"My husband and I purchased this product for our daughter because I started having nightmares during my pregnancy about waking up to her not breathing! Even the thought of how it worked put my mind at ease before she was even here, but the best part is that it works great now that we are using it. I gave it four stars because the sound monitor is terrible. It gives off a very loud static noise and we have not been able to find a way to correct it. We have eventually purchased a different sound monitor to complement this one, however, even with this problem it is well worth the money for the peace of mind it brings.One other point: Our daughter is VERY active and often scoots herself around her cradle when asleep. There have been a few nights when the alarm went off because it didn't sense her breathing because she had moved out of position. I feel that even this does not diminish the value of the product because I'd rather have a false alarm than no alarm!!"
155844,1,"We received the pink foot version of this teether. My 4 m.o. son likes it. He can grab it and easily manipulate it to his mouth. He's not yet fully teething, so he doesn't like it freezing, yet. I searched for a teether that was BPA free; this product came up in the search, but that info is not listed in it's description or on it's packaging."
177782,1,"If you live in a small apartment and need a crib that you can wheel from one room to another - this is the crib to buy. I looked everywhere and this crib had it all - compact, portable and inexpensive. I highly recommend it."
33824,2,"I have this stroller also. It is huge even when folded (although it is a snap to fold). It takes up the entire back of my minivan. I don't think the designers ever actually strapped real children into this stroller. The straps have never fit around my oloder child (he is very tall, but it wouldn't even strap on when he was 2) and my younger child, who is very average size, could only be strapped in until he was about 14 months old. Also, by the time they are old enough to need a footrest, it is too short. The holder pouch is very big, but difficult to get anything into, and the handlebars are too wide to slip diaper bag straps around. I often end up putting it on top of the sun shade, which is too low to be useful to the kids. It rubs accross their heads and drives them nuts. Bottom line, strap your kids in (if you can) and take it for a ride around the store before buying."
132682,2,"Highly disappointed in this diaper disposal system. For the price, you would think that it would seal each diaper individually. The less expense models (even the Wal-Mart brand) will. We chose in the end to just have a small garbage can in our daughter's room and a natural scent deodorizer in the bottom. The bag gets emptied daily and there are no smells of diapers in her room. Much less expense option and works the same as this system!"
93505,2,"I bought this potty for my 18-month-old baby girl. She took the potty into her room to play by sticking her hand in it to listen to the royal chimes or reward song and it was fine to me. When the batteries went low the royal chimes would go off without anybody around it and in the middle of the night it was annoying. Finally, when she seriously started using it, it leaked all over the floor. I also confirmed a reward song is not a necessary feature in a potty. Tired of cleaning urine from the bathroom floor (as if I did not have anything better to do) I decided to purchase a BabyBjorn potty (the tall one) and it works great. Love it and highly recommend it. By the way, the BabyBjorn ""short version"" did not work for my daughter because when she was ready to stand up the potty would stick to her, dropping all the urine on the floor. My Royal potty is now called the ""Royal Bathing chair"" and for that purpose, it works great. I removed the green container and musical ring. When ready to shower my little one I place it facing the faucet, seat my daughter and bathe her with the shower hose or a plastic container filled with water. Very convenient!"
71075,1,"We bought one of these second-hand when my oldest nephew was just a baby to keep at my mom's house. He loved to be rocked in it and until he could sit up, it was used as a high chair for him. He is now 5 years old and STILL loves this chair. He now uses it to sit in while watching TV, even though he's getting much too big for it. His little brother also used it for a while but the oldest didn't like that one bit! This item is well worth the money!"
110337,2,"We had our glider for a year and a half. I am so bummed with this product because the frame work of it is completely horribly made!!! It shifted from side to side at the base almost from the start. My husband attempted multiple times to fix it and couldn't... We even had to WD40 the base becasue the wood was squeeking as it rubbed together. We finally got a new rocker (different brand) before my 2nd child was born. I dont know what took us so long?! I would never recommend this to a friend, EVER!!I will give it some credit for being comfortable and spacous, but that is it!!"
158406,1,I loved these cups when they first arrived. A great size for my 20 month old daughter and she loves drinking from them. They were exactly what the doctor ordered - literally since our dentist said we should be using sippy cups with no valve to teach her how to sip. The problem is that the lids immediately started to crack on the sides. They fit very snugly and crack when being snapped on. About half of them have cracked and although all are still usable I am disappointed that they weren't a bit more durable. I would still recommend this product and possibly even buy more especially since they will also be good drinking cups for my daughter once she learns to drink with no lid - I just wish they hadn't cracked.
67244,1,Although I didn't order this as a nursing stool it is perfect for putting my feet up! Very comfortable and I don't cross my legs when I sit...Very easy to put together - I'd say this stool is &#34;as advertised&#34;...
48752,1,"I ordered this product for my 4-month-old cockapoo puppy. I have an open floor plan and I use it as a fence to keep the puppy in my family room. The SuperYard extends over a 12 foot opening and it works great. Other similar products on Amazon were either too short or too expensive. I did NOT have to anchor the SuperYard to the walls as some others have had to do (I have it on carpet, hard floors would be more problematic). If you set it up in a zigzag fashion (see the product photos) and brace the ends against your door frames, the puppy can't easily push it over. I gave the SuperYard 4 instead of 5 stars only because it is not easy for people to get through the fence. The joints between sections are stiff (to improve the strength of the barrier), but this means that you can't swing a section open like a gate. What we do is to pull the end of the fence away from the door frame enough to slip by. This trade-off is worth it to me since my puppy now doesn't have the run of the house. I think the SuperYard would also work well as a fence or barrier for toddlers and crawlers."
97292,1,We have been using this for 3 months and we love it!! We've used it both in the tub and in the sink. Our little guy loves it and we do too!! It's held up just fine and looks the same as the day we bought it. It's easier to store than a big plastic tub.
177838,1,"I have twin girls, now 8 weeks old and 9 lbs. We've been using these blankets since they were 1 week old and 5 lbs. We actually ordered more when we realized how well they worked. These are our favorite swaddle blankets. They work better than the muslin or halo blankets - these are the best. I wish they stayed softer after washes though - that's the only complaint.themomdaze@blogspot.com"
136449,2,"We got this dresser for my daughter along with the 4 piece dresser. Once assembling, we noticed some damage. Some of the damage looked like it was done before the finish, but they put the finish over it. It other parts where it was damaged, it wasn't where it was noticeable once assembled. It also scratches very easily.Overall, it is functional and looks nice."
161589,2,"I saw this tub at the store and added it to my registry. I received it as a gift and sent it back the same day. I had not tried it out first at the store, only read about its features on the box. It is near impossible to close it up to make it storgae size. I had to get a screwdriver out to push the plastic tabs in to close it. The infant sling did not clamp into the slots. Just a headache! I prefer The First Years Sure Comfort Deluxe Tub. It fits perfetly to the sink if you want it to. Very user friendly."
175699,1,These make swaddling a breeze! They are very easy to use and they help keep the baby sleeping longer and help soothe when they are upset. A must have.
43163,1,"best thing to get any place!!!. I just got this product 3 weeks ago and I am so glad with it, it's easy to bring in and out to the car, isn't heavy at all, fast to move and is very confortable for my baby, she's very happy!!!!"
52845,1,"I purchased this chair for a second child since my daughter wore out her bouncy seat. Why didn't they make this sooner!?!! I had a c-section so the first few days home were horrible. I put this chair right next to my bed and my newborn son slept like a champ in it exclusively for the first five days home. It cradles him just right,especially his head. The others do not do that!nnHe takes two out of 4 of his naps in this chair daily. It is very easy to take apart and wash too. Also easy to carry around when changing rooms to get some housework done. I wish they made this chair for grownups. After 4 weeks of being home from the hospital, I am still on the fence aobut buying the swing. I want it so bad but am scared he will grow too fast for the price."
87790,0,"I had to return the first one I bought because one of the snaps broke off when I tried to unfold it. The second one was fine except the music doesn't last but a few seconds. I had to keep pushing the button to restart the music. That's fine when I'm playing with her, but not fine when I'm trying to do dishes or brush my teeth... The black, white and red colors are stimulating for babies...that's a plus, and the thing folds for storage, another positive. But the ones that take batteries and play music for longer periods of time are better."
91887,2,"I was hoping for something lightweight and easy to carry for potty training purposes. I definitely got what I asked for, but I didn't ask to get my daughter's butt cheeks to get pinched in the process! Aside from this seat being flimsy, the package was missing the ""travel bag"" it was supposed to come with. Needless to say, I returned it and got the padded travel potty seat instead. It's a little bulkier to have to lug around, but my little girl is so much more comfortable!"
148953,2,"I bought this pillow because in my 5th month I was experiencing hip pain that was keeping me up at night. I thought this pillow could help, but unfortunately it did not help the hip pain at all. I found sleeping on the couch a much better solution. On the couch I could wedge my hip down between two soft cushions and that worked much better for me.The pillow was WAY to big for me - I am a petite person. Everytime I used it I felt like it swallowed me up. Then when I had to get up at night to use the bathroom it was very hard to get in and out of. The pillow was also not very soft so it caused neck pain as well.I'm sure this pillow would be great for someone with other pregnancy symptoms, but if you are experiencing the hip pain (and if you have it, you know what I am talking about), I would not suggest it - total waste of money."
80304,2,"Given all of the great reviews of this mattress, I purchased it in August 2011 for my four-month-old baby. It is NOT a firm mattress by any means, but I felt it was firm enough for my baby. However, over time, the mattress started to get mushy in the middle. It became so mushy that my baby (who's now 15 months and about 20 pounds) could not even pull herself up and stand on the mattress; she immediately sunk back in on her tushy. So, I decided to return it in favor of a thinner, firmer mattress. My baby's been sleeping on that one now for a week and seems to love it. I'd be careful purchasing this mattress. It seemed good at first, but did not wear well after a few months."
174017,1,"Our baby loves this swing but even on the lowest setting it seems to go too fast for him. He is now 10 weeks and up until a week ago, I would put a scarf over him and let the ends drag on the floor to slow it down. He weighed about 7 pounds when we started him in the swing and now that he is almost 11 pounds the lowest setting is a good speed and does not need a the scarf to slow it down. I don't see us ever using the higher speeds, but time will tell. Otherwise, he loves the fan and the toys and we change from cradle to swing frequently so that is a great feature."
123007,1,"I absolutely love these bottles as well as the rack system. They fit my Medela Pump In Style Advanced perfectly and have never leaked even though the rack system holds them horizontally. I use these several times every day. I read a previous review that the bottles didn't fit her Medela pump. I find that hard to believe. However, if that is the case, she should contact customer service. I have personally corresponded with the customer service department at Mother's Milkmate and they are extremely helpful, so I am sure they could find a solution to her problem."
12512,2,"I registered for this monitor thinking it would be a great idea. No cords to plug in, so if I wanted to walk around with the monitor, I could hear it, and I could even have it in my pocket and feel it vibrate. But, it never worked right. I would have to fiddle with the volume to keep it from constantly fuzzing. The vibration was cool too, but that broke after about 6 months or so. I guess I just thought we would get what we paid for, but it doesn't always work like that. I know I won't buy another Fisher Price product again =("
139727,1,"Got this for my girlfriend's 3 year old daughter a few months ago and she LOVES it. While it hasn't helped with getting her hyper self to sleep any earlier, she will at least fawn over all the stars and loves the turtle. Great hit and boys like it too."
179757,2,"I purchased this product to use for my 2 yr old son for airport travel. The first time I used the product I flew by myself & had to have a lay over in a large airport where there was a lot of walking to get to the different terminals. I put my son in his car seat & then in to the travelmate & started to wheel him to our next plane... The wheels continuously popped off the frame & I had to stop constantly to put them back on. Also, when I tried to wheel the product on to the plane to put my son in his car seat in the plane seat... The travelmate with the car seat wouldn't fit down the small plane aisles. I had to carry the travelmate with the car seat & my son over my head. It was very difficult to get the product on & off of the car seat while having the other plane passengers waiting on you to get off of the plane. I had a very bad experience with this product & I would urge anyone not to deal with the many headaches I had to deal with."
170150,1,We were so please with the quality and look of this crib. I had done research on Consumer Reports and this crib was given a high rating. Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery.
53873,2,I purchased this table for my girls for christmas and the bolt has stripped on one of the legs
18706,1,"Before I even had my baby I learned the importance of swaddling. I researched techniques and youtube videos to perfect my swaddling skills and by the time he was born I was a pro. I bought two different swaddling blankets for him. The first was the muslin swaddle blankets. They were perfect for the newborn stage. Second, I bought the swaddle me. It served its purpose for a few weeks. I did not like how the velcro lost its tightness after four washes. At seven weeks he was breaking out of it on the reg. I did more research and found the miracle blanket and broke down and bought it. It's expensive but so worth it!! at 13 weeks old I still put him it in every night. It is essential. He is so used to it by now that as soon as I swaddle him up he knows that it is time for bed. That along with white noise and his bottle. I can get him to sleep in as little as ten minutes. I never get worried about bed time. It is very easy. I credit this to the routine but mostly to the swaddle. The fabric is light cotton and I never worry about him over heating in it. I LOVE that I can change him and keep his arms swaddled in the middle of the night. He never breaks out of it but I do find that over time during the night it does get loose and I have to re adjust it. I don't mind. To me this product is really awesome!"
33969,0,"On the positive side: Light weight, compact and easy to fold, fun colors, works great with my graco car seat.The negative side: The sun shade doesn't provide any protection! the cup holder is to small for most drinks, and the wheels twist and turn uncontrollably, unless you lock them straight, but then of course you can't turn! Also the harness (between the babies legs) is so far forward my baby keeps sliding down.I wish I had done more research before buying the Aria."
23223,1,"I wanted somewhere to put my bags of milk so they would take up less room and not constantly fall over. This system works great! I haven't had any problem with bags tearing as I saw in other reviews. I use Lansinoh bags and they fit just fine, in fact I think they fit better than the sample bags they sent with the organizer. It's not difficult to work with, even first thing in the morning when I pump and am a little sleepy :) The only thing I wish it would do is have the lid fit tighter, actually lock in place a bit. The lid just sort of sits on top. But, it's really not that big of a deal. Overall, a great storage solution. I highly recommend it!!!!"
112220,0,"Oh Amazon Amazon let me count the ways I love your service. While I think the product is great, it is the service, convenience, efficiency, savvy and unsurpassed understanding of ease of use that makes the Amazon Experience so outstanding.I started out a sceptic on buying ""blind"" and paying by creditcard online. You have converted me and do a phenominal job!Just by the way I went online to a E competitor for a product I never thought you would have. After 20 minutes of trying to pay them with 2 different creditcards and being declinrd on two perfectly valid cards, I realized they were no PAL of mine if it was so hard to PAY.Keep the good values coming and may you never outgrow your fundamentals!"
118417,2,"Bought the PRI based on great reviews and price. It arrived very quickly (next day, using Amazon Prime). Ufortunately, it doest fit in my standard kitchen sink or bathroom vanities. In fact, the PRI does not even come close to fitting. I wouldnt recommend this for bathing in standard sinks. However, I plan to use it in the bathtub to bathe my newborn alongside my 2 year old. I like that it is shaped in a way that will keep the baby from slipping and I think it will be fine for bathing the 2 kids together, though my 2 year old will have to get used to bathing in shallower water since the PRI sits very low!"
58296,1,"I try to keep plastic things out of my baby's mouth as much as possible, and was ready to use stainless steel spoons (without the plastic coating), until I came across these!! They are great - well the spoon is anyway! As other reviewers have said, the fork doesn't poke anything, and I completely disagree with anyone that says that the fork is sharp. I like that it came as a set of two - I was always sure to have a clean spoon!Because these are wood, they do take a little bit of maintenance and do require being oiled every so often (with everyday use, I oiled mine about twice a month), but they're great!!."
174306,1,"I found the directions terse and confusing. After a few minutes studying the picture on the cardboard insert I finally figured out how to attach this strap adjuster correctly. I found the whole process tedious and a pain, but once on, the adjuster slides smoothly and does its job as promised.My seatbelt always hits my neck with some discomfort. The Commutemate strap adjuster pulls the strap away from my neck and towards the shoulder with welcome relief.These little gadgets are worth the money and negate one more reason for not wearing a seatbelt. Mrs. Spudman has her own set of seatbelt adjusters with similar design principle except that the back clip is already attached at one end. She likes that design better."
97435,1,"Definititely worth buying. I rented a pump by Medela for the first couple of weeks before purchasing my own. This works just as well if not better. The cups are more comfortable, and you can use only one hand if you choose. I use this pump everyday, as I work full time. I had no problems with uneven suction. I got the same amount I pumped with the Medela in less time. My best results were 8 ounces in 8 minutes. There was no pain, as long as I adjusted the suction to my needs. It had more suction options that the Medela pump that I rented. I love the extra long cord, it makes pumping in different places even more convenient. The bag is a little heavy, but it is very well organized and is discreet looking. The only negatives are that it is a bit noisy and the lids to the containers don't work very well. Overall, this is an excellent product."
81427,1,"I bought this to use and keep at grandma and grandpa's house for my daughter. It's bigger than an umbrella stroller but not enormous like some of those big, pricy strollers. It's lightweight and a great price. A big storage basket underneath. A great stroller for a great price!"
177934,1,"Unlike some of the other customers, I have never had this cup leak when all the pieces were together correctly. My daughter loves this one and uses it all the time. The only problem I have is it is hard to find replacement parts. We left it in the car and the valve and mouthpiece got moldy. As of yet, have not been able to find replacement parts. Other than that, I think this is one of the best cups on the market for toddlers and parents who want to make more conscious choices about what they buy and use for their children!"
59765,1,"We received this tub as a gift and have used it since my daughter was born. She is now 14 months, this is the only tub we ever used, and it is still in great shape. The fact that the tub is non-toxic is an extra bonus! I did feel it was a bit big for the first couple months, but we made it work.So far, I've used it sitting between 2 sinks on a bath vanity, as its easier on my back. I used to fill up the tub a bit and then have a helper hold her while I rinsed her off at the end. Eventually, I got one of those shower heads that attaches to a sink faucet (from Ace Hardware). So now, I have the water constantly draining in one sink while I give her a ""shower"" from the faucet on the other sink.(Yes there have been several mishaps with my daughter splashing or throwing the shower head out of the tub)I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an item that lasts a while. Just keep in mind, that it is longer and wider than other tubs. So check the dimensions of the space you plan on using it in."
126192,1,I love buying diapers in bulk and having them delivered to my front door. So hum-bum to have to cart them from the store to the car to the house.
52352,1,"There are not many options out there which are black in color. I first bought the Roost Edge Protectors & sent them back immediately. Then I decided to try these out. They work great, soft material and don't look garish on my kitchen table. I stuck them on my table after my toddler was tucked in bed for the night. They thus had all night to stick to the table and my toddler didn't have his attention drawn to them since he didn't see me put them on. He has not touched them and they are firmly set."
40711,0,"Has anyone else had problems with the changes in Pampers diapers the past few months? A few months ago, we purchased a few of the economy-sized packs, as we usually do, from our local BRU. The material was changed on the area that the tabs secure to! I was disappointed because the superior ""holding power"" was the reason we always chose Pampers over Huggies (which we get more and better coupons for). I contacted customer service through the web site, and was informed it was a glitch in their manufacturing process, which was corrected. They were kind enough to send some coupons for free diapers. HOWEVER, the next few packages we bought...same thing. I bought Huggies for about 6 weeks, and decided last week to try Pampers again. Surely, the ""duds"" were out of circulation by that time. Nope! Bought the box, and again...same problem. Is this problem only in the Northeastern Ohio area? Or, I wonder, did the customer service representative fib just to appease me when the diapers have been permanently changed?THREE MORE E-MAILS AND I GOT TWO RESPONSES FROM THE ""PAMPERS TEAM"". ONE STATING IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHICH STORES STILL HAVE THE DEFECTIVE PACKAGES (HMMM...MY UNDERSTANDING WAS MANUFACTURERS COULD TRACK THIS BY CERTAIN NUMBERS). PLUS, IS IT LIKELY THAT B'RU HAS THE SAME DIAPERS ON THE SHELF FROM 5 MONTHS AGO???? THE OTHER ""PAMPERS TEAM MEMBER"" REPLIED THAT THE TEAM WASN'T AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, SHE WOULD INFORM THEM, AND INSINUATED IT WAS, PERHAPS, DUE TO SOMETHING ON MY PART (HAND LOTION, ETC.). THE STRIP THAT THE TABS ADHERE TO IS NOT AS FUZZY, HOW CAN THAT BE CAUSED BY HAND LOTION/WRONG SIZE/ETC.?THEY ARE BOTH FOLLOWING UP BY MAIL, SINCE E-MAIL ""LIMITS"" WHAT THEY CAN DO. BUT, WHY DO I WANT MORE COUPONS FOR A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, IF THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TRYING AGAIN? POOR, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT P & G/PAMPERS. HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE ELSE...MAYBE YOU CAN AT LEAST GET COUPONS FOR DEFECTIVE DIAPERS!"
128245,1,"I like the fact that the lid is designed to close slowly, so your little one can keep his/her fingers. :)The wood itself seems pretty durable, but I had a little trouble with the screws when I was putting it together. The heads of 2 screws snapped off while I was putting it together. This happened despite the fact that I closely followed the assembly instructions, which said to use a handheld screwdriver as opposed to a power screwdriver.At first, I thought the problem might be that I was using the wrong sized screwdriver, but a gentleman at the local hardware store confirmed that I was indeed using the right sized screwdriver.The holes were all pre-drilled, which was nice. However, since I couldn't get the 2 broken screws out of the wood, I had to re-drill those 2 holes, and since those 2 holes were shifted over by a half of an inch, I had to re-drill *ALL* the holes in the lid (8 new holes altogether).I finally got the toy box assembled, and it works fine now, but the lid is not perfectly centered.If you get this toy box, be very very very gentle on the screws. If they're too loose, you can always tighten them up later, right?"

This did the trick and my son loves his new construction themed room. At such a good price, i recommend this!"

54406,1,"My son has been absolutely enthralled with this mobile since he was about 1 month old. It occupies him for at least 15 minutes, sometimes up to 30 minutes at a time. Yes, it's bulky and the colors clash, but the variety of motions and strong primary colors are what makes it so highly stimulating and entertaining for babies. This one costs about twice what other mobiles cost, but believe me, it's worth every penny! Unlike other mobiles, you don't have to wind it up every 5 minutes- just push a button and it automatically plays for 15 minutes. Tiny Love also has excellent customer service- my motor started getting noisy after a while, so I contacted Tiny Love and they promptly sent me a replacement. This is the best baby purchase we ever made."
20748,1,"I've been back at work for about 2 months now and these bags are great for sterilizing the pump parts at work. They are easy to use and durable. If I could just stop forgetting them in the microwave in the staff room, that would be great."
121761,1,"I bought a nursing pillow when I had my first son but then I gave it away. I'm glad I did. The first pillow was not a Boppy pillow. It was smaller and it felt harder. It did serve its purpose. It made breastfeeding/bottlefeeding comfortable and it reduced back strain for me (I've read other reviews that say otherwise but personally, this pillow helped a lot. I'm 5'3"" with a small frame). I believe it was comfortable too for my baby. I received this Boppy pillow and I thought, if the first pillow worked, the Boppy will work even better since it's bigger and it feels more comfortable (soft but supportive). I also like the cars design (my first son does too!). I haven't used it yet since I'm still awaiting the birth of my second son who's coming in the next few weeks. The Boppy is more expensive than the other nursing pillows but I received a $7.00 refund check since I sent in that card for a free magazine subscription that came with the Boppy for a refund (I figured for the next few months, I won't even have time to read). I also shopped around and Amazon has the best price since you can get the Boppy from them without tax or shipping charges."
73736,1,"Having twins we always had to write down everything, or we wouldn't remember whom we feed, when we feed them, or any details. We used to keep a chart, but then I received the Itzbeen as a gift. It is so much faster to press a button then to write everything down. When we go out I just toss it in my purse and when the babies start crying I can just pull out the itzbeen look at the timers and figure out if it is time to eat or they are just being fussy. If the boys do eat or require a diaper change, I can record it easily. no more carrying around a clipboard!I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be even better if it could track how many oz of formula the babies eat and if it could total the number of hours the baby slept.But still it is a nice tool for forgetful people. I'm buying a 2nd one, so I have one for each of my twins."
100089,1,"As a mom of 4, I have lots of experience with diapers! I tried to go the ""cheap"" route early on, but quickly discovered that it does not actually save you money to use cheap diapers. Basically, you end up changing them more often and are more likely to experience what I like to call ""blow outs."" Even when compared to the other name brands, Pampers out performs them every time. They abosorb more and end up saving you money and having to do more washing in the long run. I really love that pampers introduced t he baby dry which are less expensive but just as good as the cruisers from my extensive experience!"
67011,1,Absolutely beautiful item. Looked beautiful in gift cake I made my daughter for her baby shower.
47100,0,"I bought this stroller for my three children, who are 4, 2, and almost 7 months. The joovy caboose website lists the front sitting option of the stroller for children 6 months and up, but I recommend using with caution for children under a year, because my youngest son has actually slipped out of the stroller as I unbuckled him. I was lightly holding him with one hand while unbuckling with the other hand, he arched, and down he went underneath the upholder. I thankfully caught him before he hit the ground, but the cup holder unfortunately also caught him in the forehead. It was a good scare for both of us, but he could have easily been very hurt rather than just a bruised forehead if i had been unbuckling with two hands. He is a big baby (over 20 lbs), within the recommended age range, I had one hand on him (obviously in not as firm of a grip as i should have), and we still had a problem. If joovy caboose put a crotch post (not sure what the formal name is) on the underside of the cup holder (or on the actual stroller, but not sure how easily the stroller could be folded) this problem could easily be avoided.I still let the my youngest sit in the front-sitting seat occasionally, but never reclined and only after triple checking to ensure the restraining straps and cup holder are securely in place. For the cost of this stroller, I really shouldn't have to be so paranoid.On the positive side, my older children love this stroller, it is easily maneuvered even with the two older ones on it, the storage compartment is huge, the sunshade is huge, it's very light, and easy for me to open and close with just one hand."
112579,1,"I've tried Pampers, Luvs and Huggies. Huggies were a TERRIBLE fit while Luvs were OK, but had some leak problems. Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers are the best fitting I've found, and I've never had leak issues. I also tried those new Huggies, that are supposed to have that hourglass fit - those had the worst leaks of all. The hourglass is TOO wide and not in the right area of the legs, and the poop and pee came right out. If anyone has ever had leaks with Pampers, I've got to believe that they were using the wrong size. (I also use Pampers Baby Dry for night-time.)"
39885,0,Fine product but it needs to go MUCH louder to be an effective sound machine. Other reviews are right. The reason I bought it is because I'm having trouble finding a sound machine with a variety of sounds that dosen't have a timer on it so that it can go all night. Will be returning this product.
149691,1,"This is the second item I have purchased and a third I have received as a hand me down. I love the look, it doesn't look plastic, that we can keep it out and our living space doesn't look over run with brightly colored toddler toys. They are sturdy and easy to clean, I have a rambunctious and curious 2 year old that has broken many toys, of which she has yet to put a scratch on these items. Not to mention it is easy to assemble. All of her dolls fit nicely into the highchair. I definately recommend these and other items for those girls who like to play house."
22043,0,"I've been trying to get information from their customer service about where these bags are manufactured without much success. If you read the box carefully, it says only printed and packaged in the USA. IT DOES NOT READ MADE IN THE USA, but merely says manufactured exclusively for Medela. For all I know, this 'exclusive' manufacturer might be sitting in China (not that it neccesarily means sub-standard manufacturing practises)The first time I called Medela's customer service, they could not provide me the location of the manufacturer. I was put on hold several times and finally asked to leave my phone # saying they will get back with the information... No one did. I called again after a couple of weeks asking what happened and this time was told that the packaging says made in the US. When I pointed out that the packaging only says printed and packaged in the USA, the customer service agent insisted they're made in the US. When asked if she can confirm this in writing, she refused to do so! I followed this with a letter to Medela asking for verifiable information about the place of manufacture such as a phone number of the plant and still haven't heard back... Something is very suspicious here..."
92514,2,"I needed to return this item for an upgrade. I was disappointed with the return policy.

41857,0,"I just bought this porta-crib mattress. It is adequate in terms of quality. I've bought other porta-crib mattresses in the past that were much nicer. This mattress wasn't wrapped and when I cut the box open, I also cut the mattress. So beware if you buy one."
64308,1,"It is made of dense foam so is comfy. I bought it for the 2-year old, but the 7 year old likes it too."
32118,2,"This case fit our Radian seat perfectly (once you figure out the correct orientation, which is not immediately obvious and there are no instructions).However, the case lasted barely half a trip. During the first half, a small tear developed where the backpack straps meet the body of the bag. It didn't look bad enough that it would cause a problem on the rest of the trip. However, when I loaded the seat for the return trip to the airport, the zipper broke making it impossible to close the bag, and thus rendering the bag incapable of holding the seat. Which made life with all of our luggage, plus a seat that I now had to somehow carry, very difficult indeed.Note that this bag was only used transporting the seat to/from the airport, it wasn't like it was mistreated in checked luggage or something. Very disappointing."
46465,1,"I live in a tropical climate where mosquitos are not only plentiful but dangerous, so a mosquito net for the stroller is essential (by the way, this mosquito net also fits over the pack and play). How wonderful, then that for such a low price I also get a plastic rain cover and a toy! I would have given this 5 stars were it not for 2 things: the elastic on the mosquito net could be a little stronger so as to fit more snugly around the stroller, and a carrying pack for the net and rain cover (that ideally attaches to the stroller in some way) would also be useful."
477,0,"I accidentally ordered the Baby Dry type instead of Swaddlers, which I had been using up until this point. When I opened them, I seriously thought they were Pampers knock-offs. They are so thin and looked to be poor quality. Why would Pampers put their names on something that looks so cheap? Since they had been opened they couldn't be returned so I sucked it up and began using them. They are stronger than they look, but they are also more prone to leak than the Swaddlers because they are thin and don't fit to the body quite as well. You can also see BMs through the diaper due to the thinness of them. Yuck. So I am finishing up the box and then going back to Swaddlers. Every time I use one of these diapers I am in fear that they will leak all over something. I have no confidence in them. On the upside, you can fit more in a diaper bag, clothes fit over them more easily, and I imagine they produce less waste due to their thinness."
171158,1,"What a lifesaver the hammock feature was for my newborn. It kept her safe in the little amount of water needed. My angel is now 7 months old and is using the toddler side and is able to sit up well in this. There is enough room and now plenty of water for her to play around in. It is a great feature to just turn the tub around from a semi- ying down to now sitting up. The tub is just right for the price. The only reasons I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the it didn't fit in my small double sink and the stopper does change colors but only after the water is super hot (don't worry tried it with my daughter out of it). As with anything rely on you testing the water no other device. No one else knows better than mom/dad.Check out my little girls picture of her sitting up all by herself playing with toys. It is titled ""Having a blast in my tub!""."
118345,1,"Bought my son , He had just four months, he was very fond , amazon cheap! I will let my friends buy from here."
179704,2,I bought this anticipating easy longhaul travel with several stopovers. What a piece of rubbish. We struggled from the second we got it out of the car at the airport to check in. The silly wheel pin that holds the wheel in place kept popping out and I ended up tying the seat to the handle with the straps because it just wouldn't stay in place.The handle is not particularly sturdy (considering the price!). All in all it was a royal pain in the ****! Every time you need to detach the seat you have to screw/unscrew it at the back. It takes FOREVER. ALl the while you've either got a queue behind you or you're the last one off the plane. As for doing it with a toddler in the seat - impossible!We checked it into left luggage at our first stopover and picked it up reluctantly on the way back. Arriving back at the airport the wheel pin on one side finally gave up the ghost and I ended up dragging the whole silly contraption to a luggage cart.Don't waste your money.

105956,1,My husband and I spent about half of an hour comparing diaper pails. We decided to register for the Diaper Champ. It's now in my little boy's room and I must say that I love this diaper pail. The flip-flop depository keeps the odors locked in where they belong...in the diaper pail.
101140,1,"I use Baby Dry in size 4 for my 18 month old son. He has yet to have even ONE blow out diaper, even though he has had some tummy issues due to antibiotics. They are comfortable and fit his chunky thighs well. I've never had a leak either, even though he has some pretty full diapers in the morning."
158466,1,"These are great for little ones, Once my daughter got a little older she became attached to her blanket and had to sleep with it, by that time she could roll over, etc. so we weren't as worried about her sleeping with it. When she got older she didn't want her feet confined, but when she was little, these were great for cold winters."

94465,2,"I sunk a fortune into the Avent bottles based on all the positive reviews I had read. My son never did catch on to using these bottles. When he was a newborn, it took him forever to get anything because he struggled with the nipple. He also had a lot of problems with getting too much air, and I didn't find that these bottles helped with that in the least bit. We ended up switching to Dr. Browns bottles, which he never had any problems with and still uses now at 6 months of age.I do, however, use these as baby food containers and love them for that purpose. When I am not feeding my son an entire jar, I just spoon what I want into one of these. It fits in the Avent bottle warmer and this type of container is much easier to scoop baby food out of than a bowl where everything spreads out. Because of this, I gave these bottles 2 stars instead of only 1."
31330,2,"This system did a good job until apparently the support ring for the second level deformed and it started to fall, pretty much making the system unusable. It is a good, large drying system if you can prevent your's from doing this."
16762,0,"It arrived in a squashed box, one piece broken. But, we were doing it with our son, getting him excited so we couldn't send back. It's fine, but not for a sleigh bed (our mistake!). Easy to change sheets as other reviews said. Hope it holds up!"
23612,0,"The chair itself works great. My only complaint there is that sometimes I cant get the adjustable knob underneath to unlatch, so that gets frustrating. The other thing I don't like about it is the canvas-y material that the seat is made of is hard to wipe clean. Food gets all smashed into the little graininess of the fabric and you wipe and wipe and it looks like you got it clean, but when it dries later you can still see stuff crusted into the fabric. Luckily, once through the washer gets it really clean, but for day-to-day cleaning its kind of a pain."
158002,1,"Ultimately I bought this as a breathing monitor... and it works perfectly. We had two false alarms and both were when my son was sleeping deeply (very light breaths) after having wedged himself all the way to one end of the crib. As the instructions (and others) have pointed out... you will need a piece of wood or something sturdy to set it on under the crib. Ours was set at the perfect sensitivity straight out of the box, but you should run some tests with the baby out of the crib to see if the alarm goes off. I found that if I had the ceiling fan on the highest setting, the vibration was enough to prevent the monitor for working properly. All in all, the breathing monitor functionality (the pad and the alarm unit it connects to) is very easy to set up, and reliable. I wouldn't change a thing.However the other advertised features seemed to be poorly designed afterthoughts. The tic funtion is annoying in the room... I'd love to just be able to have the parent unit lights flick instead of having to make it tic and then ""see"" the tics through as audio parts of the monitor. Speaking of audio monitor, this one is very staticy and lacks the feature of others (like radio silence unless there's noise on the other end). I already had an excellent baby monitor when I bought this so I just continued to use that.Overall, I think $100 for just the breathing monitor functionality was totally worth it for my piece of mind (and therefore sleep). I'd buy it again (although I'd also by my other sound only monitor as well)."
60426,1,"From day one we have used this tub. It's big enough so that our babies can play with their feet in the water and stretch out, unlike with other tubs. A good feature is that that they will be able to use this when they sit up. Recommend highly."
92913,1,"** NOTE: I purchased this late March 2012. I believe I have an updated model as compared to the description of the product in previous reviews. **Now that my kids are a little older, my wife and I plan to do a little more traveling. Unfortunately the entire family sleeping in a large king sized hotel bed is becoming less of an option. We decided that purchasing travel cots/beds would be the solution.There were some key features we were looking for:* First, we wanted a bed that was economically sound :) I'm sure anyone reading this who has more than one child understands that when one kid gets something, the others have to have the same. In our situation we would need to purchase 2.* Second, we wanted it to be compact when stored as we have minimal vehicle space already. As with the previous note, we would need to cram 2 into the car.* Third, ease of assembly.* Fourth, durability. This and the previous note pretty much does away with an air mattress. I've had plenty of air mattresses in my time and convenience and durability have always been questionable.In searching I came across this one and another one that was very close to fitting the bill. Unfortunately the other one cost more than twice what this bed cost. considering I had to by 2, the choice was obvious.I was a little concerned about some of the previous reviews. They have noted that the center support strap is too tight and it creates an elevated section in the middle. This would obviously make the bed uncomfortable to use for anyone who had to lay across it. There were enough positive reviews that I decided to go for it and see if I couldn't adjust the bed to make it more comfortable.I am happy to say that the bed is better than I had expected. Especially so because of the cost. As I have noted at the start, I believe I have an updated model. Perhaps Regalo had read all of the more negative reviews and took them to heart. There is no strap in the center but instead there are criss-crossed straps on both sides (I have attached pictures so you can see how it's supported now). There is still a slight hump in the center from the tension of the fabric between the two center supports but it's not bad. My little girl doesn't mind and she actually asks to sleep in the bed each night.Hope this helps anyone who is thinking about buying this. Honestly you can't beat it for the cost."
8590,0,"I received one of these as a baby shower gift. The only part I really use the the handles at the side to air dry bottles. I do not find much use of the disc with bottle slots because everytime I wash the bottles, I need to wash the disc too."
31922,1,these are compatible with the ameda pump. they are a useful size (2.5 oz.) and are reusable. they are not sterile packed and need to be boiled before first use.

132261,0,"This shade is gorgeous, we have the JoJo Designs Oriental Garden. The problem is that we have been to Target, Walmart, Lowes, Kohl's and a few other random stores and still cannot find a lamp base that fits this shade. Right now it is an odd table decoration since we don't know what to do with it."
105502,1,"We looked into the Diaper Geenie, but why would you spend so much money on the refills over time when all you have to do is...take out the trash!!It kills me to read reviews where people are wanting the kinds of pails so they don't have to take out the trash as often...how long is too long? We take out the garbage 2 times a week or as needed and even when we have gone for a whole week we don't have any problems with the smell of diapers from this pail! Of course common sense applies here.We are members of Costco Wholesale and purchase their &quot;tall kitchen trash bags&quot; and they fit perfectly in this, we have even purchased the Ruffies garbage bags that smell like lavender as our baby got older and her poop got a little smellier...but the bottom line to this is keep the pail clean...even a wipedown with a baby wipe would work, and take out the trash at least once or twice a week! This is the best pail and we have given them as gifts...worth the money in the end!"
1455,1,I prefer these diapers because the swaddlers had a mesh that stuck to my babies bottom. My only complaint is that they are a smaller fit. I will have to order a size 3 next time.
177070,1,"I was a little shocked at the price of this gate, but it's probably the best &quot;wide&quot; gate available. We use it (the black gate) around our fireplace and it looks great. I feel very secure knowing that my 18 month old can't hurt himself on the brick hearth or get near the fire. Worth every penny. I did have to take it down to have my carpets cleaned and that's very easy, by lifting up and pulling. No muscle required. :)"
107132,1,"My son is 2 now and we still love our Diaper Champ!! My husband changes the bags when he takes out the trash. When my son was born, we bought a roll of kitchen trash bags (cheap ones) and those have been the best bags for the job. Please note: We tried the poopy diapers in the Champ, but we would have to remove the bags more ofen so now we just take the poopy ones outside and leave the wet ones to the Champ. I recommend this product to everyone having a baby. It is so much more superior than the Diaper Genie (I had that one first)."
78816,1,"This product definitely helps to free one from carrying around a car seat all over the airport. My husband and I can almost never remember how to put this together while we are scrambling at the airport. But it is basically easy, so wonderfully small, and convenient. I would recommend this to anyone carrying around a car seat at the airport."
150028,1,"We used the tray for the first time for our 3.5 year old son, he loved it. He used it for his monster trucks and beanie babies as well as some snacks.It was great for me too because on a normal road trip I have to twist and turn around in my seat to grab a toy off the floor that he has dropped or that has slipped off his lap, with his toys being on the tray nothing fell off. The tray is not solid sturdy but it was not flimsy either. I think it will be great on all our road trips and I would recommend it to anyone traveling with a child."
144003,1,"This is a great way to mount a gate without worrying about ruining your bannisters! Our bannisters are square at the bottom and round towards the top, so it was great to have the square and round options both in one package. The round part of our bannister also tapers slightly, but the round attachment still fits securely."
138200,0,"I got this at my baby shower and was excited but that died quickly when I realized that it has some flaws.Pros:1) Different brightness settings2) Actual constellations3) Cute!Cons:1) No option for how long you want it to stay on, like the sound soothers by Cloud B2) The lights are stationary, which doesn't always keep baby's interest for longOverall, I like it and so does my son but some improvement could be made and if it broke I wouldn't purchase another."
123593,1,"Excellent product! we take it on all our trips. It is great because it holds our toddler to sleep in, not just for babies!"
37442,1,"The reviewer who said this is ""Baby Windex"" was so right! I love it! This stuff is a little pricey, but the bottle is big and it lasts forever. I've had mine for weeks and barely made a dent (and not for lack of using it!). It's gentle and non-irritating on my brand new baby boy. I use it between baths because I don't have time to give him a bath every day! It keeps his diaper area and face nice and clean and it smells HEAVENLY. I've used it on his whole body, too. I just can't get enough of this stuff!"
177993,1,"I highly recommend this play mat. It is very well designed and our baby has gotten a lot of use out of it. The toys are at the right hight for a six week old infant to bat at, which is not the case of many mats. In addition, the mat has wonderful little attractions for tummy time as well such a crinkly leaves and dragon fly wings. In the early days of tummy time, the little pillow is also a nice feature. We no longer use the entertainment bar because at six months she has out grown playing on her back, but we have transferred the hanging toys to her stroller/car seat and they are still fun for her. She continues to use the mat for tummy time."
161471,2,"I took this bath back after opening it and finding that nothing seemed to work right. The directions tell you to press down on the center ""button"" to ensure that it doesn't leak. Supposedly you're supposed to hear it ""snap"" into place. My husband (who is 6ft 3in tall and weighs 200 pounds couldn't make it go ""snap"". Also the baby sling didn't fit securely into the bath so I worried that it wasn't safe. I took it back and got a baby sling-type thing that fits in the kitchen sink, it was only $9.99 and made by Especally for Baby."
89579,0,I thought they were the swaddlers so i was a little disappointed. But they worked fine. I think you should use cloth because it is more cost effected and better for the environment. My babe was to small to fit in the cloth diapers that we had so we had to use disposables. So I am very happy to start using cloth now that he is gaining weight. But what whatever diaper you choose you are the best mom or dad for you baby. Keep up the good work and and love them lots.
77953,1,"One of the best love gifts a person can give to their baby,has to be the softness,and fresh sented BABY MAGIC PRODUCTS.I have five children,everyone of my children used BABY MAGIC PRODUCTS only. I never had any problems. I really love their products because my baby smelled so fresh, clean, and loved."
126667,2,"I've raved about the Gigglastic in the past and truly thought Huggies made a quality product, but now I must change the assessment.With son #1, we fared well with Huggies and their Gigglastic waistbands. We had the occasional ""pee-through"", but nothing out of the ordinary. However, over the past couple of weeks, Huggies has not been able to contain the poo or pee of son #2. The blow out he had in Barnes & Noble last weekend was incredible--the poo ran up his back to his shoulders...amazing! Now, with each diaper change, we must change clothes as well. It defeats the whole purpose.Maybe the Gigglastic is better for the larger sizes. I don't know. It's unfortunate, because I want my son to giggle...with these diapers, I'm afraid it's impossible."
167444,0,"The backpack itself is what I expected however, what I received didn't match the image displayed. The one I received has red along the seams making it look much more boyish than what I was going for. Almost returned it out of stubborness, but decided it wasn't worth the hassle, given how much it was."
170089,1,"We bought this crib based on all of the reviews and a Consumer Report list. We never actually saw the crib in person prior to purchasing it, so we were a bit nervous initially. It was completely worth it, though! The crib is gorgeous, sturdy and matches our furniture perfectly! (We purchased a separate furniture set from a local furniture store, hoping the colors would be 'similar.') Highly recommend this crib!!"
120098,2,After 3 weeks of using these I went out and bought new bottles. They leak way to much and you might as well deal with spit up. Cause after you are done feeding the baby they are soaked and you have to change them. Then they are awake fussy cause they have been moved around to the point that they spit up any way. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY TILL THEY FIX THE LEAKING PROBLEM
54271,1,"I have absolutely gotten my money's worth out of this mobile. I would have given it 5 stars except that the gears are somewhat noisy and it eats batteries like candy. I haven't had a problem at all with the on/off switch (knock on wood). My baby is now 7 months old and has loved it since Day 1 and is still fascinated by it. In my book, it's a Must Have!"
7426,2,"We used the snap-n-go when they first came out...liked it then. Now with our third child we rec'd the newer version. We have an Eddie Bauer carrier. The booklet that comes with it shows the carrier and gives instructions on placement. The problem is that the Eddie Bauer carrier is only held in place by a strap - it DOES NOT LOCK INTO PLACE, like all of the other carriers would. Now, it may seem that why not use just the strap - well, the strap is the SECOND saftey mechanism for the seat...and really should not be used as the only one b/c when you move the stroller the seat moves around....the latch is for a reason, and if you cannot securely latch the carrier - they should NEVER instruct you to be able to use it - just to make the $$. We're returning it! Sorry but our child's safety should be their concern...too!"
100493,2,"This diaper is OK during the day. It is very thin, flimsy, feels really cheap, but it is sufficient to hold a medium-size mess during the day. However, it leaked all over every single night no matter what we tried. I would actually test different diapers every night, and this one would always have the most leaks all over. Cruisers did a bit better, Huggies did as well (actually as bad) as Cruisers...but, still there were leaks every night! If you are used to Swaddlers, be ready for a huge disappointment! This diaper cannot be used overnight. Our boy is 13 months and 24 lbs,and is long. Even tried a size bigger as it was suggested. Had to go back to Swaddlers...size 4 (sensitive-the only type of Swaddlers in 4) and no more leaks! There are never any leaks with Swaddlers!!! Pampers Baby Dry is the worst Pampers diaper I have ever used!!"
141532,1,"My 7 month old got this for a Christmas present. It has been her favorite toy since Christmas and we are now in the second week of January. She gets excited when she sees it in the morning and there are endless things for her to press and interact with. The songs will get stuck in your head and you'll be walking around singing, &#34;welcome to our learning farm, we have lots to show you....&#34;, but it's totally worth it!"
128701,1,"The Avent Variable Flow Nipples allow formula mixed with cereal to pass through the nipple hole with ease. At a baby's young age, when the flow must still be relatively slow, you can turn the nipple so the Number I that's embossed in the nipple is lined up with the baby's mouth. This allows the formula mixed with cereal to still pass through the nipple hole easily, but doesn't cause the baby to choke due to the formula flowing too quickly. As your baby gets older, you can turn the nipple in his mouth so the Number II is lined up with the baby's mouth and this allows for a quicker flow, and, ultimately to the Number III &quot;setting&quot;. The only two negative things I can say about these nipples is that (1) you can't find them in any store. After finding the initial two packs of nipples in a popular baby store, I had to buy the next two packs over the Internet. They weren't available in any store. And (2), there are no instructions with the nipples to explain how the variable flow works and how the numbers correlate with the rate of the flow."
47819,1,Installing this product was quite easy and has proven to be a great choice! The gate is durable and very easy to use!
47716,1,"I bought 3 of these - one for each twin's crib, and another one for the changing table. Mine came as a two-piece foam and it was no problem aligning the two pieces together. I keep these under the sheet+ waterproof mattress cover, and the ""seam"" between two pieces of foam is no problem with this setup.We also had the issue of our girls sliding down on these after a couple of hours. We tried rolling a towel and tucking it in as a ""U"" shape and that didn't work. But we finally figured out a way to keep our girls in place: rolling a towel into a ""Y"" shape and placing our girls into the ""fork"" of the ""Y"". This prevents the sliding. Here's how we do it, also pls see the uploaded image. I recommend using a fluffy bath towel(i think these have more ""grip"" to them); also, I do swaddle my LOs before placing them in the crib:- Take a towel, unfold it and lay it out flat- roll from one side, widthwise, until the middle of the towel- roll from the other side, widthwise, towards the roll #1, until the middle of the towel- take a velcro strap, a ribbon or something similar and tie one end of the towel to hold the two rolls together and prevent them from unraveling. Where exactly you place the tie depends on (1) the size of your towel, and (2) the length of your kid. Your towel should resemble a ""Y"" shape now- flip your towel over, so that the rolls are facing down, not up, place the towel into the crib and unroll slightly to allow for the width of your kid- When I put my LOs to bed, I typically align their shoulders with the top of the towel. They stay in place and don't move."
162341,1,"I love this handy little case and use it constantly. With the grandparents out of state and plenty of illnesses and long fingernails while being away from home, everything came in very handy and still does. I love the thermometer for baby and the whole family. The aspirator is small, but if you press it from the top, it works fine. The dropper and the spoon work perfect and come in super handy with medicines. The clippers are nice and comfortable to use. I love it and would recommend it to anyone."
30005,1,"The plus of this set is that the bumper is very plush and the height is also good on that and the minor minus is also the bumper, the corners of the bumper do not exactly fit to the corners of the crib for us to tie the threads. The quilt and the crib skirt are also good and durable."
34014,1,"I bought this bag to pack my daughter's seat for international trip. We were gone for almost a month and took eight different flights with it.Prior to the purchase I had checked other reviews to see if our Recaro Como seat would fit in it. It fits perfectly, leaving some seat space for extra necessities.The bag did its job and protected the seat, although it took some good beating. Half-way though the trip we had to get the bag repaired - the bottom of the bag was torn on one side. This was not because of the bag's quality. I watched from my seat as JFK Delta's loading crew was dragging bag, which probably caused the damage. The seat inside made it both ways from California to Eastern Europe and back with no damage. ****** Extra star - for that extra room. We were able to pack the space with enough diapers (Costco's sized box!) and baby wipes for entire trip!!!"
7335,1,"My daughter is now 11 months old and she received one of these when she was born. She Loves to play with the tags/ribbons on it and it is great for development because our tags/ribbons are different textures (don't know that this particular prouduct has different texture or just all satin. She loves to feel each different textured ribbon. We got ours from a different site: [...]- It is cheaper in price (a lot cheaper) and they are called baby tags. We LOVE ours and the quality is great - they are handmade there and fleece material as well.As a mom it's GREAT because it's machine washable and I can hook the tag/ribbon onto one of her little ""link"" toys and hook it to her stroller - which means we never loose it because it's attached! :) Our baby tag is a little smaller though 7x11 (w/o the tags) which is nice because it's easier to carry around and if you are concerned about the suffication aspect of it you have a little less risk since it's not as big (which I agree could happen with any type of a blanket). Hope this helps someone."
59301,2,"I have a very petite 13 month old and my house is a bit older, the spindles on my bannister are too far apart and she could easily fall through them. I needed something so I thought I would try this. There is no way to secure this tightly to the bottom of the spindles on the railing. Because the fabric is so flexible and the rope ties are too my daughter at 13mo old figured out in 2 min that she can just slide the fabric up the spindles. The clear plastic sheeting is far superior (and 3 times the price). I have the clear plastic sheeting up now and it is much safer."
76042,1,"These trays get the job done for preparing and freezing homemade baby food. I like that they are BPA, PVC and phthalate-free, which is what sold me on them in the first place. They lids fit securely and it was easy to get frozen cubes out if I left the trays on the counter for a couple minutes to thaw. I really didn't need to do anything else to get the food out.Like a previous reviewer said, the cubes are not one ounce. Like other ice cube trays, the cubes are about 3/4 ounce. That's fine, it's not like my baby has to eat exactly 2 ounces at each meal! I just keep in mind that it takes 3 cubes to equal the size of a stage 2 meal if I want to compare it to prepackaged baby food."
71917,1,so far so good...only complaint is that it is a bit difficult to unsnap out of base and seat belt buckle can be a bit difficult too...but i guess that means it is all secure. great car seat overall!
61252,1,"I used the wide opening model for 3 years with no problems. I would give the Diaper Genie all 5 stars if I didn't have to use special refills. My solution was to stock up on them so I never ran out. I never had a problem fitting any of my child's diapers through the opening - even her last diapers, which were size 6. I found the Genie easy to use. It took a few tries to get a feel for where the clips were and then it worked great. I easily taught my husband and mother how to use it, and no one had a problem. Extremely handy that the refill instructions are on the refill ring.I didn't notice any smells while it was closed. Emptying a Genie full of toddler diapers was definitely smellier than when it had newborn diapers in it. I don't think I ever had to clean the inside, although I did spray it with Lysol occasionally.We emptied the Genie twice a week, which I found acceptable. If the diapers stayed in longer, emptying it would have been smellier anyway. Once my child was two, I put mostly poopy diapers in the Genie, so I didn't use refills as quickly.Some helpful usage tips:1.) wrap up the wipes inside of the diaper. You won't get your hands dirty. If you have a bad blowout and can't wrap it because the sides are poopy, fold the diaper over and put an extra wipe or two on top before you push it down. My husband didn't wrap the diapers in the tight ball like I did and he still managed to keep his hands clean and the pail didn't stink.2.) Definitely tie a knot at the bottom of the bag... just like the directions tell you.3.) If your bag doesn't stay twisted, give the Genie a few extra twists - especially if you've got a big mess in there! Another reviewer mentioned 5 or 6 turns worked well. This should prevent the first diaper from untwisting. Also,leave the knotted end of the bag right on top, rather than pushing it down before putting in a diaper. Pushing the knot down makes the diaper sausage link too big, which may cause the diaper link to untwist in bottom of the pail. My husband used to push down on the knotted end and I think this is why the bag sometimes became untwisted when he pushed the first diaper down. I didn't have this problem.4.) When my toddler had solid stools, I flushed the lump and put the soiled wipes and diaper in the genie. I think this did wonders for stink control within the pail. For convenience, I moved the Genie to the bathroom and found its narrow width is an advantage in a small bathroom.5.) Before I started a diaper change, I opened the lid. I used the flat surface where the plastic bag is as a shelf to hold the diaper. This kept the baby from kicking into the poop before I could finish wiping. The Diaper Champ, which I've heard good things about, is round on top, so I wouldn't be able to do that.I'm having twins and will probably get a second Genie for downstairs, as the first worked so well. I'm also considering the Diaper Champ. Knowing that my husband didn't wrap the diapers well has me leaning toward the Genie. Then I wouldn't worry about poop contacting the surfaces of the diaper pail."
174119,1,"My 10 week old son absolutely loves this swing and will sometimes fuss just to get in it. We can put him in it while he is awake and he will watch the mobile (which is great) or just enjoy the rocking. He was asleep in it one night (and since he was strapped in and right beside our bed) we went to sleep and he slept 9 hours while rocking back and forth at age 8 weeks. He loves to take afternoon naps in it. The side to side cradle rock is just perfect for young babies.** We use this swing for hours every day (and sometimes even all night - 6 or 7 hours) and he is now age 10 weeks and we have replaced the batteries ONE time.The pillow is a little fluffy but he is a big boy (14 pounds at 9 weeks).The soothing colors are great because they do not stick out as the first thing you see when you enter the room.WE LOVE IT and are sooooooooooooooo glad we got it. (However, he is less than thrilled with his Papasan seat. He is not a fan of the vibration and there is no volume control.) Hope this helps new parents."
140599,0,"I was disappointed with this carrier. My newborn was consumed in it, meaning he was buried within the material. I couldn't see his face, and I was constantly worried his nose might get blocked.Also, I found the material rough. It's not a soft cotton; it's more like a canvas.Lastly, the carrier also ended up hurting my back after about 40 minutes. In the end, I returned it. I just couldn't see myself comfortable enough with its safety and structure to use it much."
45814,1,I tried other seats and this is THE BEST. Soft cushy seat. Large enough for all the parts to fit. Good for boy or girl. Easy to clean. Don't mess around with other ones. I have two. I am looking to see if the sell replacement cushions for the seats. One is wearing out after 3 kids trained on it. Hoping to find that.
162418,1,"We bought this kit four years ago for our son and have used everything. It all works well and has stood the test of time.We've moved twice since then and have lost a few items, so we plan to buy the kit again for our second baby.The eye-dropper and medicince spoon clean easily in the dishwasher. Plus, the medicine spoon is still handy four years later.The thermometer is not rectal-only, which is nice. Although it does not beep when finished, I believe the number stops blinking, so at least there is some signal of completion. We have found it consistently accurate.The case is the perfect size to fit in the front pocket of our diaper backpack. Since we leave most of the contents in the nursery for daily trips, the case can be used to hold bottles of infant pain reliever, anbesol, or any other baby medicine that shouldn't be loose in the bag.We have found this kit to be an extremely good value!"
172864,1,My son seems to like drinking water from these spouts. Every once in a while we get a little bit of leaking between the spout and the adapter. It's not enough to be annoying. Overall the product is what it says it is.
21548,1,lost a part. my inlaws dissembled it when we had to travel and now we d'ont have a part to resemble it completely. also the manual is lost. kindly send me costumer service number. but overall good bouncer.
25277,0,"I like the stuff n scuff, but my 2 year old son kicks alot and actually ripped the fabric off of the frame. I used black duct tape to do a self repair. Also the kids can't reach the pocket when strapped in their carseats. But my seats are staying clean!!"
28583,1,"We received the product without Allen key (L shaped tightening tool), which is must for assembling, but we had it already, so it was easy to fix. My wife liked it after assembling. We are 5'.5 inch, its very good for us. may not be a right choice for tall people.Overall we liked the glider/ottoman."
151565,1,We use this in our bed and love it. I like having the baby on my side instead of the middle so the covers don't get tossed over her. The flannel is very cozy for us to sleep on and it is easy to wash. Highly recommended for all co-sleeping parents.
80904,1,"I love this product! My baby loves to sit in the cart and this is perfect. Just today she was leaning over and chewing on the cart and I was so thankful this cover was there! I hook a toy on the little toy tabs and she is happy! It fits the cart at the big club member store (Costco) . It fits the little carts at the drug store and the other little grocery stores (Trader Joes). It also fits the carts at the bigger grocery stores (QFC). The only cart I have trouble with is the new big red plastic carts at Target. But we just wrap the store seat belt around the cloth backing and she stays put. Although it doesn't cover the handle that you push. I also used this on a wooden chair at a restaurant. It totally worked after some maneuvering. It's pretty, and wraps up nicely so you can carry it by the buckle in one hand with your purse and still hold your baby in the other arm. Takes a few minutes to get situated so if it's raining it's best to set it up and put baby in it inside the store. I never have to worry about my baby getting a cold, wet bum in the rain."
97283,1,"We have had this booster for 2 years now and the quality has been excellent, the fabric is hardly worn, and it is very comforable (according to my 5-year old)."
163101,1,We love this backpack and so does our son (11 months). It's great for trekking around the city as well as taking hikes in the mountains of Vermont. We've thoroughly enjoyed it so far and look forward to using it for quite some time!
38538,1,"I bought this when my son was a newborn and it was wonderful for those first sponge baths. It was ok to get it all wet (unlike the carpet) and it was nice and soft for him. I then began just laying it in the tub and again he loved it. However, its use was shortlived because he no longer lays down to bathe. And it sometimes collected the water and cooled it rapidly so the baby was laying on a cold sponge while bathing. That was the only bad thing about it."
48918,1,"The play yard is made in good size and is great overall. It does its purpose that is to keep my 10 month old, who is crawling, out of trouble. He loves to stand up holding onto to it also and i guess it helps him walk better. The only thing that is a little hard is to fold it as it is large and I am always trying not to bang to furniture."
39939,2,"Oh my gosh, this is by far the worst sound machine I have ever seen. It comes with batteries and so you would think that it would run on batteries but they are only for shipping and the demo mode...makes no sense to me. the buttons do not wok properly, you have to mash them several times to make the connection."
87456,1,"I decided to switch to Playtex Premium for my 2nd baby(I used regular playtex last time) because I liked the clear silicone nipples that are closer to the breast shape. Little did I know how AWESOME this kit would be!! The most impressive part to me was the breast pump adapter - I can pump directly into the bottle liner with or without the bottle!! I gave the kit 4 stars because it only comes with one breast pump adapter. I haven't found where I could buy just the adapter, so I'll be buying another kit since I have a double pump. My baby latched right on to the nipple and her mouth looks just like it does when she is nursing - very pleasing to me."
30894,1,"We lived abroad with my first born and we used our sit n stroll for three or four international flights a year!! The kid was comfy and as I was traveling alone with my son most of the time, I found it to be very managable with the sit n stroll and my backpack. Moved back to the states and had baby number 2--used it often as a loaner stroller to the grandparents--when they had the kids in tow--and I still used it for flights here--all in all a wonderful investment-Tips: You will need to ask for a seatbelt extender on airplanes--no big deal they have them--and you will need to raise the armrest to ""click the seatbelt"" and then lower it for takeoff.Good luck!"
17345,2,"You would have to be an idiot to buy this. Read below.This piece of equipment is unable to get clear audio reception.We live outside the city with neighbors more than 100 feet away. We have no phones, no anything that uses 900 mhz (or any other frequency). I tried 100's of different orientations of the monitor and its cord to reduce the static (which sounds like a machine gun... ha, try sleeping to that). At one point I had it reduced but as soon as the dog came in the room it started firing again.So shoot the dog and you might be alright."
183514,0,I put this tape around our platform bed and the next morning it was hanging down like a garland. Have to fix it every day now.
137302,0,"Sadly, I had to return this pillow, as it was Waaaay too big! When I ordered it, I thought it might be too small, not puffy enough, but just the reverse! I might be terrific for some folks, but I found it incredibly hard to move it around, and get into a comfortable position...and I as I am a real tosser and turner, it wouldn't work for me. Also, as I think someone else mentioned, the head pillow part was very rigid, not comfortable. Otherwise it was a great product...very good quality. But not for me."
18387,0,"I found these bottles on the site when I was searching for something for my newborn. I saw that these bottles got a 4-4.5 star rating out of over 100 people. The only thing I heard was that they are hard to clean. I am not having a problem cleaning them, it is simple as long as you don't let the milk sit in the bottle. The hard part is that THEY LEAK!!! I have the 8oz and the 4oz bottles. I only make 3oz bottles so I know it is not because I overfilled them. If you warm the bottle up in warm water (which is what I need to do since it is breast milk), the milk rises into the reservoir and leaks!!! I tried to warm it in the portable baby warmer and it did the same there. Beware when you try to uncover it, it will spill!!! You have to loosen the bottle top before warming or else there will be a mess! Otherwise, I love the bottles, they work great for the gas etc."
38860,1,"I wish I had started using the safer bather sooner! My four month old daughter loves it! We were using a plastic tub that I had received as a shower gift. She never seemed completely relaxed nor comfortable in the tub. Besides, she was growing too big for it at 3 months. I read all the reviews for the various different tubs, and decided to give this a try. I must admit that I had my doubts when I bought it in the store. Would this &quot;cushion&quot; support my daughter? Would it be safe? Would it dry quickly? After her first bath, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my daughter was well supported, safe, relaxed and happy! I just hung it up in my shower afterwards and it was dry by the morning.The safer bather works well in our standard bathtub. Don't mess around with bulky tubs that take up valuable storage space. They only last a few months anyway."
4419,1,"great bag for all dad's with newborn babies. great styling, you can't even tell that it's full of diapers and milk. The only problem we had was that the baby wipe dispenser pocket didn't actually work with any of the wipe brand's containers that we used. Oh, and the fact that it made my petite (5'-0""tall) wife look even smaller than she already is when she had to carry it. Well worth it though. We've had ours for almost 5-years now and will soon be using it for our next child."
62276,2,"I love Colgate. Both of my sons have had a Colgate mattress (the Visco-Classica 2-in-1). This mattress was a replacement for the one he had used since birth (we purchased it just prior to him turning 4). Now 9 months down the road all the ""stuffing"" is coming out of the mattress. For a couple of months I have had to use packing tape to keep it all in. My son likes to jump on his bed occasionally, and this mattress just couldn't stand up to it. If you have a tame child who will use the mattress just to sleep, then you should be fine. However, if you have an active little child like mine, you'll do better with a mattress with a damask cover that won't rip and get caught in the springs of the bed when he (or she) jumps on it."
115676,1,"I bought this stroller a couple of weeks ago for a trip we were going on. It's a lot easier to carry around than the big ones that take the car seat. I love the 5-point harness, and it folds and unfolds pretty easily (the plastic clip is a bit unruly). The harness snap is stiff, and I've given myself a couple of blood blisters trying to close it. We borrowed a friend's older version a few months ago, and ours has some improved features:-better canopy to cover baby-better handles (I think they're more ergonomic)-better undercarriage basketCONS: I'm 5'6"" and have a little trouble with the handle height. I'm not sure why someone can't make an umbrella stroller with extendable handles, but I haven't seen one for a decent price. I find that when I'm walking at a moderate/fast pace, my feet hit the wheels. I can get around this by holding on with one hand and walking beside the stroller, but it's a bit aggravating. Also, when you fold up the stroller, the wheels hit the top of the canopy and leave dirt marks. Minor, but slightly annoying when you live in a dusty area.PROS: The 5-point harness works great for my 5-month old. The basket is big enough to carry a small diaper bag. There is no cup holder, but I hear you can purchase snap-on ones at BRU. Overall a pretty great product."
159462,1,"We are so thankful that we have this bouncer, she loves to sit in this and enjoy the equal vibration all around the chair. When she has a little gas it seems to help soothe some of the tension away. I can set her in the chair and do some housework and she is totally content. You can also bounce the chair with your feet and keep the baby happy by the bouncing action of chair. For 30 dollars such a great lifesaver to give you some time to get things done and keep baby happy."
64024,1,"I thought I'll purchase this to try on my 4 month old since he was so strong that he got out of all the swaddling blankets (no matter how tight we made it) and either end up without a blanket in the middle of the night or scares on his head from scratching during the night. To my surprise, this swaddle worked really well and he was unable to get out. It kept him warm during the winter season and I do not have to worry about him catching a cold from kicking the blankets away. This swaddle is easy to use and does not restrain my son from kicking - which he loves to do. Even after many washes, the valco maintained its strength. A very nice product overall."
60983,0,"I don't know how I should review the Diaper Genie. It beats throwing diapers away in the trash can, but I've never used another brand of diaper pail. I registered for the Diaper Genie because it's such a name brand. But 4 months into this, I've run into a few problems. It's easy enough to use, but the first 2-3 diapers you drop in untwist and fall into one bag. That bottom bag can get so heavy, that you lose the ability to twist future sections. I've actually had to reach down and pull diapers out and start again. Also, while replacing a refill, a little plastic tab that secured the ""child proof"" lid broke, and now the entire top pops off with little effort. And, a plastic tab holding the bag cutter onto the lid broke off, so we lost the convenience of hanging the cutter where you can find it. I know nothing's perfect, but I think I'll go with another brand next time."
37171,0,"Cool, bag - Target shipped the wrong one so I ended up getting one direct from the manufacturer. As always I love Amazon's return policy and even with other companies errors Amazon takes care of you. Target on the other hand made this such a miserable purchase experience I will not purchase from them through Amazon again. Combine the embarrassment with the time I wasted to no avail in their store trying to get this handled quickly and it will be a while until I bother going to their locations again."
135850,0,"I had heard great things about Dr Brown's bottles so used them from the start for my baby. She has not had any colic at all and I really don't mind washing these bottles like a lot of people do. But I was very disappointed when I started using the 8oz bottles. After about a month of use, the markings on the bottle started coming off and now I can't even measure the milk properly. I have switched to playtex ventair now and because the nipples on both these bottles are similar my baby has had no problems adapting to the new bottles."
171389,1,"Works great, has one end for infants and one end for toddlers. Nice buy I think it's great to have."
103788,0,"This is good because it does catch baby's attention with bright colors and music. The infant setting, gives you a long music setting. The music is a bit loud, I put cotton taped over the holes.Not so good..when the batteries get low, you need to change them right away, it makes this horrible, scary sound, rather than cheerful music.I have had my gym for about 4 months now, and when I press the buttons on the toddler setting, nothing happens. Music is sapposed to play when you touch/pull the buttons and hanging toys.The batteries aren't low, but elmo is moving back and forth very slow, with no music, so basiclly I can't use it, after 4 months.But the 4 months it was used, it was nice. I would reccomend something else."
87521,1,"I ordered this stroller because my daughter was getting too heavy to carry around in the bucket seat - and I never had purchased the snap and go - and with her outgrowing that infant seat in weeks no sense buying now. But found that when not with my son (we used the sit and stand when he isn't at school) I needed a easy, lightweight stroller for her. This is easy to fold (you don't need to bend over to pick up into the back of your car - saves on the backaches - and I can fold it up and lift into the back of my suv with her in my other arm...) and unfold...cup holders and snack tray are convienent that most umbrella strollers don't have, wheels work great - overall I have nothing bad to say on this product. So far so good..."
47458,0,"I like knowing that my baby is safer in this car seat, and I really appreciate the head pillow that it comes with, because all three of my children have been born under 6 pounds. However, I find myself frustrated in the day-to-day use by the difficulties I have getting it out of its base and by how hard it is to engage the buttons simultaneously to move the handle. The handle thing is the most annoying. If you're not positioned straight on, trying to engage the buttons for moving the handle, it's nearly impossible. Because of this, I hardly ever move it, which makes it less safe than it would otherwise be. I would probably tell a friend to look for another car seat with the same safety ratings."
151279,1,you can see your baby perfectly and the mirror it's big so it's perfect the quality is good .. .
107228,2,"The Diaper Champ is TERRIBLE at keeping the smelly diapers from only smelling in the container. Our baby's room was constantly stinky (due to the Diaper Champ, not the baby!), and we were having to empty the container almost daily. What's the point of having a diaper disposal system if you can't dispose of diapers efficiently? Please don't buy this product unless you enjoy smelling those dirty diapers. The Diaper Champ just doesn't work."
8875,1,this is beautiful and has held up very well. I have gotten lots of compliments on this cover. l l
75194,1,"This pump works great and quickly. Its easy to clean (best if you have a steamer) and easy to use; however, the noise coming from it is so loud. I wish there was a way for it to be quieter. Still, it is reasonably priced and a good quality product."
7046,2,"Like the other mom reviewer, I always used cruisers. The latest box did not indicate that Proctor and Gamble had altered the product. The new ones with mesh liner are not as aborbent. My son leaked nightly and soaked his clothes and his sheets. This did not happen when we used the original version of Pamper cruisers."
8050,1,We have been using lil goat's milk products for the last year my son has very sensitive skin he rashes very easily and is prone to ecsema. This is the only diaper rash ointment that works and does not have an adverse reaction it clears up rash within hours and we use it every time we change him. We also use the lil goats body wash it works as well as cetaphil. Even though you have to buy it in a 4 pack I have researched and found that Amazon is the most inexpensive way to buy this since it is not sold at any stores in my area.
54831,1,"We received a bear mobile which is too plain but our baby still enjoys it. Then we decided to buy her another one, when we visited babysrus store, we just falled in love with this mobile at first sight and carried it home. We were so glad to have it cz our baby loves it 10 times than the bear one! She never gets tired looking at it, it's really a mobile revolution!"
84546,2,"I got this a a baby shower gift. It was what I had asked for but I was very disappointed after the first use. I had to keep stopping it so the milk would flow into the bottle. Plus, it was so loud I couldn't even hear the TV. Thank goodness I only had to pump a few times or I would have went nuts. I am going to buy a manual pump with my next baby. And I will definitely read the reviews before I waste $40."
139070,1,"I purchased this for christmas as well as a butterfly dreamlight. By comparison, this one has four buttons for color selection, dreamlite has one. They both turn off automatically. My 3 year old loves this and her 6 year old sister can't tell the difference. It's a great product."
134930,1,"I used them for years and can't recomend anything better. I started using them when my 6 year old son was 2 for drinking milk. I like the easy to clean opening, the only type I find good for milk. I still have the spout I first bought 4 years ago and it is in good condition. I still use it when my son does not feel well and drinks his milk in bed; I removed the valve for him because he's too old for it and he's carefull not to spill the content and it works well. I would recomend it also for all those sick people that can not get out of bed and are struggling with drinking liquids with the help of a straw, this is much easier.I recently bought more of this for my younger son and he loves it too."
39172,1,I found the Wendy Bellissimo Vintage Teaberry Collection while looking online for appropriate themes for our first daughter. We just set up the bedding in a Classic White crib in our peach colored nursery and it looks amazing!!! We've registered for all of the items in the collection and so far we are tickled pink with everything we've received!!!
22926,1,"Pros:Fits easily.Doesn't kill your shoulder (depends on your child I'm sure).We take this on vacation, when we go to the beach or something, and walk around the boardwalk and stuff like that. Everyone comments either on it or how cute our baby is, or a combination of those.Cons:I guess the safety issues are the only thing I can think of to list for a con. You cannot buy these type of slings at a box store like Babies ""R"" Us; I'm guessing because of people saying that children can suffocate. But we started using this with our child around the age of 8 weeks, and at that point, our baby was big enough that she fit such that it didn't look like a safety hazard for her at all. So I would caution someone to wait at least two months before using an item like this, but otherwise, we've never thought twice about it, and our child has been fine."
121259,0,"I ordered the bag after much looking around and I am overall happy with the purchase. The bag is of good quality and very well made. Here is what I am able to fit in it.In the 2 inside (back) pockets: 3 diapers, a small plastic bag dispenser and a small box of wipes.In the 2 side pockets (these are meant for bottles): 1 nursing apron and 1 burping cloth.In the main pocket: A change of clothes, a jacket and a swaddling blanket. I roll these items to keep the bag organized and the items easily accessible and there is some space left. I would have liked to have been able to carry a small blanket but it does not fit.In the front zippered pocket (this pocket is not very deep, which in a way is good as you don't have to dig things out of it): My wallet, digital camera, car keys, a small pack of tissues, a pack of gum etc...)In the front velcro pocket: A pair of socks, mittens... This pocket is not very useful at all as it is located just below the front zippered pocket and when that one is in use, this one becomes very cumbersome to access.In the 2 outside side pockets: A bottle of water and a toy.In the 2 outside front pockets: My cell phone in one pocket and miscellaneous items in the other pocket.Being able to hang the bag off the stroller is nice as everything in the bag is within reach. Loosing track of the regular strap is easy though when loading and unloading a child in and out of the stroller."
65260,1,this silverware was a big hit at Gramma's house for my 3 and 4 year olds. they feel grown up and yet the silverware fits their hands. I would reccommend it highly
32129,2,"While I looked for this product exhaustively and was so excited to find it, I'm sorry that I spent the extra $60 now (I had to buy 3). This product is form-fitting and has no markings or instructions to tell you which way it fits over the car seat. If, like me, you just think you can tug the zipper up over the carseat, you'll find that you are not only wrong, but you'll blow the zipper and the seam, leaving you with nothing. Skip it and just check the carseat in with your luggage if your taking it on travel...."
31239,1,"We have a small bathroom where I need to wash up bottle and breast pump parts -- this rack fits in the corner of the bathroom counter, near the sink. Drains directly into the sink and gives us lots of room to dry everything. The two tiers give space for small parts to dry as well. It's not a work of art, but it's very functional. Our bathroom would be a giant mess without this to keep things all neat and organized!"
122345,1,"I use this all the time for making baby food. Thought I'd use it in place of my full size processor for chopping, but really it only purees so hasn't worked out for that purpose.Pros:- Very easy to use- Works quickly- Not messy- Easy to cleanCons:- Only purees- Quite noisy- Only enough room for small batchesOverall, I'm very happy with this product."
179032,2,"I purchased these bottles when I was still pregnant thinking that they would be great for the switch between breastfeeding and bottle feeding. At first they were ok, a bit confusing perhaps but still working alright. Then they started leaking. I read the instructions on how to heat them up and I did it the way it was detailed and they would still leak. Not just one of them but all of them. If you're a breastfeeding mom, you know how important that milk can be for a newborn; it's gold! I would lose a few ounces which would mean I'd go and have to pump more to make up for it. So I just threw them out and opted to go for Avent Natural bottles instead. Haven't had a problem with them at all. So just save your money. Sure they're cute but I'd rather have a full, happy baby :)"
34796,2,"I research EVERYTHING (if you are reading reviews you probably do as well). From that stand point this seat looked great. We even put our 11 mo old in the seat in the store. The problem came when we actually installed it and went on a road trip. My son sleeps in the car alot. With this seat his head flopped forward, waking him quite a bit. My wife sat in the back with him and had to hold his head back for an hour! It does not recline as deeply as we think it should and we made sure it was in it's most reclined position (rear facing-has to be reclined anyway). It concerns me that with smaller infants this could cause a problem. I'm not car seat engineer but our first seat had a safety indicator on the side that made sure the seat was reclined at a safe angle for infants. This seat had no such indicator. Our first infant seat was reclined much more when it was in the safety zone than this seat. Again being no engineer, it is still difficult for me to believe that a seat that can fit a 5 pounder could also seat a 100 pounder. Also, there was alot of room around his hips and sides. Sure you can stuff blankets or what ever around his hips/ body but this is made difficult by the way the straps come around his legs. I would not have wanted to pack him in like that as an newborn/infant.I just don't think that this seat can pull it off comfortably for the baby and safely for Mom and Dad's peace of mind. You can buy 2 or more seats for advancing stages of a child's growth that actually fit him/her for the cost of this seat."
133897,0,"I bought this potty seat because of its easy-to-clean design. It looks like it would work great for a girl, but the built-in urine deflector is not high enough for a boy. Even after I taught my son to ""point it down,"" the urine went under the deflector and collected between the toilet seat and the potty seat, leaving a ring of urine on the toilet seat when an adult went to use the toilet. The seat itself is easy to clean with a disinfectant wipe."
14753,2,"These bottles were supposed to be the &quot;best&quot; so we went with them, and they were good for about a week. When you would put the tops back on and shake them to make sure that the formula was mixed - the formula went EVERYWHERE! You would have to screw the top on and off several times to get a good seal, and even then it still might leak all over and run down your baby's chin and chest. I also found that my son was getting way too much air from the nipple, you could hear it very loudly. These bottles are all in all NOT worth it, I hope that this was helpful to some of you :)"
63232,1,We bought this toy box after our first box was recalled (totally different toy box). Setup was very easy for my husband. The color is great and it looks very nice in our living room. I like that it's on wheels and the lid stays where it is placed. We have no worries about getting pinched fingers or the lid falling on their heads. It's very sturdy and my twins both stand on it together to look out the window. I wish that I would have bought this toy box in the first place - no regrets!
121109,0,"My daughter did not like this bouncer from day 1. First of all it doesnt really bounce it just vibrates, the one I had didnt have the mobile either. She always cried when we put her in it because I think she was bored. I went out and bought the Aquarium bouncer and she loves it. There is more to look at rather than just sitting there."
140819,0,"I got these thinking they were ""variable flow"", but they're actually for ""cereal"", not what I expected."
25292,1,was received folded in a circle like a sunshade. It kept some twist after I unfolded it. Otherwise good. Not bad for the price!
25302,1,"I just bought a new car and it has beautiful black leather seats. I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old. This means that both will not mix, especially in winter! My kids kick the back of my seats and get salt and mud on them. This seat protector works wonders! It was a little tough to find something under the seat to tie it down, but once I did, it stays put! LOVE IT!!! Luckily my seats are black, the protector blends in. I would recommend this product to anyone with kids who want to make sure their car stays clean!"
152498,1,"I bought this bed for my son when he turned 15 months old. He had destroyed his ""hand me down crib."" He loves trucks so this was the perfect bed. As the previous review said it adds safety also and I am not afraid that he will fall out. The night light is great eventhough my son doesn't need it but it just adds that red glow to the room. I think its a great investment and when he grows out of this bed, I am sure it will be a great yard sale item if we don't decide to have more kids."
142105,2,"I am all for babywearing! Much more convienent that lugging a huge car seat around and far easier and cost effective than manuvering a stroller! However! This carrier makes babywearing a pain in the neck (and shoulders and back, and arm pits, and boobs! - and that is just for the wearer!) The baby gets to dangle like a starfish, and is separated from the heat and sounds of the wearer with all this material.Also, it really does require two ppl to get the baby in and out safely, and that is with a willing, awake baby- forget about pulling a sleeping baby out of it!And, this thing costs too much, and the baby out grows it so quickly! (size adjustable?! For a month and a half!)To top it off-- you have to be very clever to breastfeed it this contraption.Bottomline- if you want to wear your baby, (There are SO many benifits to you and baby)-- I strongly urge you to invest in a sling, or wrap, or pouch that is easy to get baby into to (the whole baby, not just the torso), one that is actually comfortable for both wearer and baby, and one that really adjusts to baby's size, up into toddler hood.Baby Bjorn just doesn't any of that for me! And the simple cloth carriers are less expensive too! :D (and can be made from organic materials!)"
26927,1,"30 weeks and the pressure on my pelvic area and back made walking very uncomfortable. I needed support for work, sleep and yoga. I purchased this one for work since the band width is discrete. Wore it today and wowsers .... it lifts the belly up a bit relieving the pressure and pain!! It also provides enough constraint that my back is supported. I wear this over a cami so that I can use it daily without needing to wash often. It stays put and doesn't interfere with pulling pants up & down for the repetitive bathroom trips :)I purchased a full belly band that is flexible for yoga which provides support but doesn't restrict. For sleeping, walking, and lounging around the house, I purchased the Gabrialla maternity belt since it has a very wide back support.For the price and the results, you should buy this! I went with the recommendation of buying a size up and glad I did. I'm 5'5 pre-preg 112 and currently 145. I purchased the medium and it fits nicely on the tightest setting which will give me some room to grow with it. I'm knocking one start because the distance between the adjustable widths are spaced out too far. It would be helpful if there were in between clasps or if they were closer together."
19270,1,"We got this as a gift for our first baby and loved it! It keeps the baby straight in the car seat so they don't slump. I'm not a fan of wrestling with props and blankets, and no other headrest we tried even worked a little. We loaned ours out after our first baby, didn't get it back, so it was put back on our must-buy list for baby #2."
110237,1,"I'm a penny pincher but having gone through 2 of the cheapest possible glider/ottoman combos, I decided to go a step u pand get this one. Not expensive by any means but certainly not the cheapest. Boy was I impressed. I LOVE rocking in it with my baby. It looks great, cleans very easily (our new baby is a spitter), and glides like a dream. I would, and have, reccommended it to anyone. Great deal!"
54759,2,"I agree with everyone else that has had a negative feedback for this item. Like many others, I thought this would be the ultimate mobile for our son...with all the stimulating colors & animals & stuff. I feel very lucky that it hasn't fallen on our baby's head like many of the other people claim. Our problem has been that after only about a week the mobile stopped turning...only the music plays. I took it back to the retailer and got a new one...we've had it going for 5 days and it too has stopped working. HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS OVER-PRICED MOBILE: IT WILL EITHER FALL ON YOUR BABY'S HEAD, OR THE ANIMALS WILL STOP ROTATING (if they even work at all). Save yourself the time & money & frustration. The company just blows people off and will not properly handle complaints.I will never buy another product without seeing what other people have to say about it here at Target.com. This is twice I've been burned by products that I could have avoided if I would have come here first."
70382,1,"My baby girl was born with a full head of hair. When she got the cradle cap, none of the usual remedies worked (oil and petroleum jelly just gooped up her pretty hair). This foam shampoo worked wonders, and got rid of her cradle cap in no time. It smells good too, and the scent lasts overnight. I plan to keep using it forever, and I'm going to give it to all of the expectant mothers I know at their baby showers. It is a little pricey, but you get a lot and only have to use a little at a time, and like I said- it really does work."
55753,0,"Works good when I can get the button to push in, which was only half the time my first week with it. I called customer service and they were very helpful. They told me to send them the cord, and they will send me a new unit. For now, 2 stars for the warmer, plus 1 for customer service. Will re-review after new unit comes in."
133474,2,My baby dropped 3 of these bottle on the floor and they cracked open. For what they cost you would think they would be a little stonger. I e-mailed the mfg twice and still have had no response.
107319,2,"I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ. It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn't contain the smell. Babies 'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again. I would say it's a product default. We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out. Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they're soaked, it wouldn't fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we'd have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers. I'm pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails."
18528,1,"We absolutely love these bottles! We have used them with our son since birth and have been very happy with them! Others may think they are expensive, but they are cheaper than buying those stupid liner refills for the Playtex bottles. Never again will I buy those things! (we used those with our first son, and it sickens me to think of how much money we wasted on those things)As for the added &quot;work&quot; of cleaning, we just throw them in the top rack of the dishwasher, and they hold up like a champ! Our son does well with the nipples, and even switches back and forth between the tall models and the wide-neck versions. My favorite ones are the wider, ergonomic ones, plus they fit in the dishwasher a little better. You won't be disappointed in these bottles! They are perfect for all babies, with collic or not."
13973,1,"Avent bottles are the closest to mother's breast as far as the nipples and the shape and quanity it holds is great. It is very easy to pump breast milk into. I have tried other bottles but i keep coming back to Avent they are the best. All Avent products are superior to all others.Mom of 2 children and one on the wayI will only use Avent for my kids.ThanksAna Soto, New York"
145734,1,"I purchased this for my then 5 month old daughter a month ago. She loves it! She doesn't care for many of her other things (swing, bouncer seat) but she'll gesture or jump in my arms to let me know she wants to be in it lol Once she's in it, she goes to town jumping away & playing with the toys =)"
12093,1,I'm pregnant with twins and have found it impossible to sleep comfortably since about 4 months along. The wedge supports my belly while I sleep so it doesn't put pressure on my already-aching lower back. I actually got two so I don't have to move it when I roll over at night. I don't think I'd survive this pregnancy without my wedge pillows. Highly recommended.
147145,1,"Although the picture is a little hard to see, this is a really gorgeous diaper stacker. It is delicate and sweet, and also very well made. Perfect for a new little baby's room. I would definitely buy this again and it would make a great gift."
114294,1,It is convenient for carrying.Extra tray could help keep clean.The price and quality is good.My son loves it.
183650,1,"This Boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well. We've washed it in the washing machine several times, and it's very durable. If you're looking for a soft, simple, durable Boppy slipcover, I'd highly recommend this one."
2874,1,"You will never regret to get this boppy, babys love it, they sleep on it in the afternoon, much better than use a pillow under your arm,but you can find the same thing at Wal-Mart for ten dollars less, the one at Wal-Mart has Spill Proof cover, this one has soft touch material."
115462,1,"It's gentle, it's organic, and it's without artificial ANYTHING. I have been using the liquid soap and the bars for years, and our family uses Dr. Bronners exclusively. I recommended this bar of soap to my sister who was using a special soap for acne, when she switched to this her cleared up drastically. I used the liquid tea tree soap and left it on my dog for 15 minutes when she had fleas and it worked like magic! I use this soap on my son and when he plays in the bath and puts his hand in his mouth after they have been in the water, it's one less thing I have to stress about, because there are no nasty chemicals in this marvelous soap!"
111514,1,"This is a great manual pump. It meant to be used when milk supply is well established. It's quiet, comfy, and extract my milk efficiently. I can use it in my car (and everywhere) and don't have to worry about running out of battery. Most importantly, I can adjust the suction force and rhythm for my own preference. Unlike some other pumps out there, I can clean the smallest passage of the Lansinoh pump throughly with Dr. Brown's tiny brush. Just be prepared there are more small parts to clean than the other pumps. Hints, the 4 stars."
9602,1,My son is a big 20 month old so finding a potty chair for him has been very hard. This one is perfect in size and there is additional room to grow. If you are looking for a plan jane potty seat that does what it says then this is the one.
133941,1,"This warmer is just great. I read about the brown wipes, water spills, etc. but we haven't had ANY problems. As long as you keep the pad wet nothing turns brown. Even when we've forgotted to wet the pad for a long time, only the pad has dried out & turned brown- none of the wipes ever did. They just dried up a bit & weren't as warm. And once you re-wet the pad it turns white again. Also, I read that another poster could only get the pop up feature to work with a certain brand of wipes but we've used lots of different wipes & they all pop up fine. I've opened the lid several times & never had any water spillage either. The lid is curved so all the water stays inside the warmer, even the condensation drips back inside when you open it. I really love it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because the original we got as a gift didn't work at all & we had to return it & get a new one. That one has worked just great."
1003,2,"Going from Swaddlers to these was a HUGE mistake. The name ""baby dry"" should be a joke, because the diaper gets damp very fast, and ALWAYS smells like pee. It's not my baby either, I have to change out the diaper about twice more than normal and most of the diapers are barely heavy. Seems like such a waste... should've bought the smaller amount to test first. It's odd how the same brand could have one type vastly superior to the other. Again, go with Swaddlers, we had ZERO issues with them. ""Baby dry"" is a lie."
122066,1,"I, too, had a little frustration getting the straps all set up...I'm just not patient when it comes to reading directions. The first time I used it...I thought there would be no way I could ever get my baby in it when I was alone. Needless to say, the 2nd time I gave it a shot, I was able to get her in no problem. My husband and I aren't skinny people, and the lumbar strap wasn't big enough for us. I had my mom...QUEEN of the fanny packs...check her collection and she found a strap that we could extend it...so it all worked great! My 2 month old is very comfortable in the rear facing position and sleeps the entire time we are walking! Works better than pushing a stroller when walking a dog, too!"
167986,1,We are very happy with this product. We love the pee strip telling us when our little one has a full diaper.
152570,2,"I actually bought two of these in the diva urban style. I have two girls 11 months and 29 months. It wasn't big enough for the two year old it only went half way up her chest. She is not that big either--- weighs 29lbs. I really liked the way it looked and the material but for the cost I couldn't see keeping it. I don't think it would have lasted through the winter. I wish they would make them bigger. So I ended up purchasing the Kiddopotomus brand ""Go Cozy"". It is not as pretty and it secures with velcro but it is much larger and it goes up to 4years. It is also much less expensive."
880,1,"I love these diapers as far as fit and for during the day wear, but my 6 month old son soaks through them almost every night. I used pampers with my daughter and did not have this issue, so it might just be that boys pee more in the front so thus it has more holding in the front. they are still a great product and for sure a great value!"
155538,1,"I needed turquoise crib sheets to match a homemade quilt. Was surprised I couldn't find sheets that would work anywhere! Was happy to find these sheets online, although I was worried the color wouldn't end up matching. The color is great, perfect!!! It's a boy's room, and the color would be great for either. Infact I would say it matches the color on the screen exactly. They washed well, quality seems good (very soft cotton jersey). The baby hasn't arrived yet, so not sure how it'll wear."
149981,1,I liked this item very much. I did think that it needed to be a little more solid though. But overall it's great for snacks and activities.
72604,2,It was a waste of money and my baby can't suck anything out of the spout we were excited about it but are now made because it was a waste of money
176166,1,"I bought this item and the Built NY Thirsty Tote, Dot No. 7 for the 218 ounce Kleen Kanteens we have. The totes fit the containers perfectly and keep the contents of the bottle icy cold. I love that the top of the tote unsnaps so I can hang it on my purse strap. So far, the construction is holding up well."
41305,1,I have read quite a few of the reviews and was surprised to see the complaints about shipping time. I live in upstate NY and have ordered these twice and got them in 2 to 4 days both times. I figure why carry them home from the store and pay tax on them when I can have them shipped to my door so easily.
63646,1,"Love using this in shopping carts, but it is a little more difficult to get into high chairs. My 9 mo old ended up grabbing a glass of water on the table and dumping it right in the middle of the seat while we were trying to get her in. Everything was soaked, so we ended up just putting her in the high chair without anything. Also, I get a lot of comments about how ""fancy"" it is when I go to target or the grocery store - as if people are saying that it is extravagant. Maybe it is, but she loves having easy access to her toys attached to the loops and I'm happy she is not putting her mouth all over the cart. A win-win in my book!"
45910,1,"This product is the best 'Santa' present we bought this year for our infant son. He is only 5 weeks old, and he LOVES this mobile. Santa set it up on his play mat and we placed our son under the mobile on Christmas morning and he played for over 30 minutes right away. He is currently playing again, swatting at the mobile and coo-ing and kicking. It is adorable to see, and he is definitely focusing on the cards. We have all black & white cards on the mobile right now, and I can watch his eyes track from one card to another. I did not find them hard to attach, as others have noted. What I like best about this is that it CAN be attached to his play mat so he can lay and play on the floor. I did not want a stimulating mobile for the crib, since it is my hope that he will actually SLEEP in the crib. This is perfect, we just attached it to a link-a-doo instead of setting it up on the included arm. We will be able to hang the mobile up higher on the playmat by taking it off the link-a-doo as he gets older, too. Right now, it is the perfect height for his little arms to swat and make contact with the cards. Or, I think it would be a great mobile for the pack n play as well. Love this toy, highly recommend it if you are looking for something for your infant to play and interact with! I like that it will grow with him with the interchangeable cards and more complex designs. Wish we had it for our first son!On a side note, I took one of the cards off and set it up in front of my son for tummy time and it doubled the amount of time he was happy on his tummy just to look at the b&w; design!"
72823,2,"We used this almost daily for over 2 years. It is easy to read and use and my son has loved it as a bath toy also. It is durable and well constructed, but the batteries cannot be replaced. The first sign if the batteries going dead is the green light will cease to function. (It actually still works, but is so dim as to be useless.), then the yellow, then the red, then about two weeks later it is completely dead. We are having a hard time without it, as the other backup thermometer we have is a chemical strip and very hard to read. I would recommend buying this from a brick and mortar storefront, just because if it has been sitting around for a while and the batteries are dying/dead you can easily exchange it. If the batteries were replaceable it would have gotten 5 stars with a doubt. I do understand though, that it is difficult to make a safe and reliable electronic item that is designed to be fully submersible."
140204,2,"I bought this stroller last week for my 2 daughter's age 11 months and 3 years. I was beyond dissappointed. This jogger should have never been created. The entire design is horrible. First off, the front tire does not swivel. This is a huge consideration when buying a jogger. This stroller is only usable if you ONLY go STRAIGHT. you can not turn what-so-ever. You have to lift the stroller and slide the tires accrossed the ground to go in any other direction. So if you think about it, you have the stroller that is 30lbs, and 2 kids weighing a combined 70lbs! THat's 100lbs to lift to take a curve or turn! Not only are you jogging but you need to be a weight lifter too. Second, the only back support and adjustment for both children to sit up or lay back is an adjustable strap. And this doesn't allow for a straight up sitting position. the seats eem to hold the children crooked ( I'm not the only one that has pointed this out) so that they are sinking in towards the center of the stroller. Third of all, it is described on the box as folding compactly. After you take off all 3 tires, you still can't fit it into the trunk of a large sedan.I guess you get what you pay for. Of course this is the cheapest duo jogger around, the only real thing that is attractive about this product."
42316,1,"Makes everything so much easier. Grocery shopping, walks, going anywhere. Plus as a bonus no one tries to touch her because that risks touching me or looking creepy :) My daughter enjoys being in it far more than the car seat and I feel like it keeps her warmer, especially now that it's getting cold."
128609,2,"This one is ok, but the exterior material pills very easily and becomes rougher with every wash."
112721,2,"Like many of the previous posters, I have been using Pampers since my son was born almost two years ago. The new ones are terrible. They leak to the point that my son wakes up because he's soaking wet every night (necessitating a diaper and pajama change, which completely wakes him up, so it takes a good hour or two before he settles down and goes back to sleep). I'm hugely disappointed, have contacted Pampers Customer Service but no response yet. In the meantime, am also searching for a new diaper."
146757,1,"Literally, the single best purchase of my life! My daughter has been obsessed with the jumperoo since day one and bounces herself to a state of bliss every day. We bought it when she was 5 months, because since week 10 she has been happiest when standing supported and bearing weight on her legs. We thought she was ready because she could sit unsupported and had very good muscle control. She goes in the jumperoo several times a day for as little as 5 minutes and would sometimes stay longer than 45 minutes if we let her. She has gradually improved swivel technique and can whip around between the toy stations with ease now. She really responds to the music, which is jump-activated, and the overhead toys are great. The jumperoo is how I get everything done during the day and is just an all around lifesaver. Assembly was very easy, and the cloth seat is washable. We take it with us to all the grandparents houses, and can even pack it in a large suitcase for flights."
170613,0,"We just bought this for our 8 month old daghter today and while the assembly is easy there were some broken clips that hold the seat on. This could have resulted in injury if I hadn't noticed it. The car is so cool I did not want to return it , so I customized it a little bit by puching holes in the seat and using some strong twine to attach the seat. We are going to call the customer service number on Monday and complain, and maybe get a new seat, and hopfully get them to recall and replace these seats with some better quality seat clips before any babies get hurt. This car walker was made in China, and with all of the recalled toys from China lately I am also concerned about possible led in the paint, who knows. It seems like a good walker and it has many features, that make me want to keep it, and I still think it deserves at least 3 stars. I really like the wheels, and how easy they roll on our wood floors."
49395,1,"This play yard is the greatest thing to happen to new mothers, espicially ones that garden, since the invention of disposable diapers! I bought two and an extension panel, which make for an ample size playpen. Inside, I put a Little Tikes climber, a Step One ladybug sandbox filled with pea gravel, and a Playskool Grow-With-Me picnic table, and he still has plenty of room to romp. I can garden without having to pull him out of the fish pond or retrieve him from a newly planted bed of tulips."
103978,2,"I bought this product about 6 weeks ago and was incredibly excited about using it for the first few days. I had been pumping manually for almost 2 weeks using the Isis manual. My baby was premature and unable to breastfeed so I had to resort to pumping every few hours to feed with a bottle. At first I was overjoyed with this product. It worked better for me than the manual pump and cut my pumping time in half. Then, a few weeks into things, I started having problems with the pump itself. Sometimes it would suck when I released the handle and release suction when I pressed it in (backwards). Then sometimes it would flash a red light continually for no apparent reason. Other times it would be working fine and just stop for no reason in the middle of pumping and just revert to a green light but not do anything when I pressed the handle. Then the other half of the time it would work just fine.I called customer service to try to get a replacement and was shocked to learn that they would not help me. They insisted that I send back the pump so they could check it out then they would see what was wrong and then maybe send me a replacement. Well, as any lactating woman knows you can't just go days or weeks without your pump. I could not believe that these people were telling me that I would have to figure out an alternative on my own. The customer service rep actually said to me ""You know, you can just use the manual pump attachment included for the next few weeks until we can figure out what is wrong with your electric pump."" Well, that's not really an option since you just told me that I have to send back all of the components included in the package my pump came in now is it? My point is that for $350.00 you should receive a little better service. It's not my fault that their product is defective so why should I have to be out several hundred dollars for a pump that doesn't work. My only option is to buy another one to use while they are checking out the messed up one they sold me. Either way I am screwed and their customer service dept couldn't seem to care less. I already own almost every Avent product made so totally switching to another brand isn't really an option but I will never buy another product from their company. I have never experienced such terrible customer service or company practices in all my years as a consumer. Think twice about buying from them because if you ever have a problem with a product you will be out of luck. Also, their bottles leak half the time (even when properly assembled) and the newborn nipple is WAY too fast flowing for any normal newborn.*** Two months later I have continued to use this pump when it will work and use a Lactina when it doesn't. It takes me twice as long to pump the same amount of milk with the Isis as it does the Lactina and When I use the Isis exclusively for several days on end my milk supply starts diminishing..."
175253,1,"I love these little bowls with the lids. The lids fit on tightly. You can actually put puree in the bowl, snap on the lid, and throw it in the diaper bag without worrying about leaks! Fabulous. I make my own baby food and freeze it in small portions, so these bowls also work perfect for thawing. I put a serving in the bowl, snap on the lid, and put it in the fridge to thaw overnight. They are lightweight, so they also make a good ""toy"" for the baby in a pinch. I would definitely recommend these to a friend."
83924,0,"Everyone who sees us whip this out thinks it's the coolest thing, and it is a great idea. It's very portable and a better alternative than trusting my monkey child with a real plate or putting his food on a gross table. But he mostly rolls it up or pulls it off the table. Also, the material it's made of attracts filth of all sorts from everywhere, so stored inside a diaper bag it tends to come out with hairs and weird dust on it. It's a little tough to clean, too. But still, better than nothing."
112840,2,"Was pretty disappointed all in all. The idea behind these are great, and we use all different brands of green & eco friendly products, but these weren't the best diaper that we have used. The cotton product that we use for absorbency all bunches together in the crotch area. It all bunches up and then they leak out the sides. They are very very thick and bulky, and almost none of her jeans fit up over the diapers. Even walking seemed pretty hard because of all the bulk between her legs. The close tabs on the diaper are also the old fashioned stick tape tabs that just tape onto the plastic belt around the top. Once is all you get, and if you are potty training like we are this is relatively a pain, usually we just have to throw out the dry diaper and get a new one. Which is also very costly. I gave this product 2 stars because I love the idea and for babies that are under the crawling age I think that they would be great! But they definitely need to revise the product and update it a bit at least for toddlers."
80781,0,"These pullups work well for us as overnight protection for a potty trained preschooler. They fit well, absorb moisture well in case of an early morning accident, and my daughter loves that she can choose from two designs each night. The down side is the sides rip easily when pulling them up. Just a little too much oomph in the pull and they pull apart. And they have a strong scent, which doesn't bother my daughter but I'm not a fan of."
163798,1,"This product definitely saves space but I've had a hard time cleaning the tray. Yes, it's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that I end up hand-washing it. There are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that I'm always finding places that I misseed washing. Trust me, the baby will manage to get food there too!This product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing (I've seen this on some highchair models)."
116692,1,"I purchased the Cardinal Gates Patio Door Guardian because my little ones kept opening the door and trying to sneak out of the house to play. Rather than stand guard directly in front of the door, I thought this would be a better option. When the product came, I was surprised that a 7/16"" drill bit was required. That is pretty large for the average homeowner and didn't fit into either of my drills (which have a 3/8"" chuck) after I went to the store and bought this drill bit. This may be because I have a manufactured home and everything is oddball sized, however, the upper plastic track that you are supposed to screw on did not fit in the space between the top of the door and the track. Because of this, I am using this product without the upper plastic track that comes with it and it still works just fine. The bottom line is I haven't seen another product for this purpose that looks like it is designed as well as the patio door guardian, and I did search for a long time."
97519,1,I love this stroller. We were hesitant to buy it because of its price but it is totally worth it. It's lighweight and easy to use and fold. The basket is not easily accesible when using the car seat on top and that's the only concern I have so far.
126089,1,We have been purchasing Huggies through three babies. I've tried other brands but my husband and I both feel they 'blow-out' more than Huggies on a regular basis. Purchasing this product through Amazon Moms makes it a great deal.
233,0,"I really wanted to like these diapers. They are soft and have really nice vibrant colors, a nice change since I use Huggies usually. I also love the slight baby powder smell. It seems people either love that or hate that. I find that the Baby Dry diapers run small. My baby is on the small side, not even 16 lbs. yet and Baby Dry in a 3 fit him perfectly, there is no way they could work for up to 28 lbs. My son had a couple of leaks in these diapers and it was always up the top because they just don't fit snuggly around the waist like Huggies do with their extra elastic around the waist band. I am betting these diapers would do well for baby girls and for chunkier babies (although you might need to order a size larger) but to get a good fit around the waist for my baby I will have to return to my tried and true Huggies in spite of no nice smell, faded pastel colors and a not so soft diaper. Whatever works though..."
167234,1,"I was a little skeptical when I looked at the price of this car seat, but it came HIGHLY reccomended and I figured what the heck... Simple to install with the latch system both front and rear facing. Very easy to get level unlike my Graco Safeseat. It is very secure. No wiggle room at all. The best part about this seat is my sons comfort. He loves it. He doesn't get overheated or too cold in it. He falls asleep almost instantly once the car starts moving! I am very impressed!"
104434,1,"After trying for hours to fine one available in local stores, I went with the net search.Shipping was fastPacking was excellent.All items in box arrived in good shape.This is a well made and sturdy gate.Working with a another person makes it go much easier.Instructions left a little to be desired as far as final assembly, but you can figure most of it out on your own. I did use the glue strips to position the cups. So far have not had to go back and secure the cups with a nail or screw. But we are talking about a 7 lb puppy right now.You need to pick up the gate a little as you press the tab to make it work smoothly.It will swing shut with authority, so be sure no one is in the way.The ability to open the gate either way is a big plus!A great gate at a great value!"
69539,0,"My 4yr old refused to use this as it was very uncomfortable for her in her toddler seat. I, on the otherhand, loved it for myself when she refused to use it on our trip."
117221,1,"I bought this gate for my daschund mix to prevent her from running wild over the house and it's been fantastic. The build quality is top notch and not cheap looking/feeling like those plastic gates you see at stores like PetCo and other places. It looks great in our house and serves it's intended function very well. If your dog is well trained, it can be used for bigger dogs but if your dog likes to jump on things/go wild, this may not hold back a larger dog such as a Golden retriever or German Shepard if they put weight on it, though I haven't tested that assumption. It can be a bit confusing to put together at first but once you understand it, it's pretty simple to adjust and make stable."
68295,2,My daughter just got her first diaper rash at 7 months old. I bought this when she was born for instances such as this. It was a pretty bad rash. I slathered some of this on and my daughter literally tried to crawl out of her skin. She was almost hyperventilating and screaming. It was terrible.Why would you put Cetyl Alcohol in a diaper rash cream? I'm assuming that is what caused the immense pain. I also tried A+D and Extra Strength Desitin. The Desitin worked the best. None of the other brands made her scream in pain.
109365,1,"I love these for when your baby is teething--put in an ice cube, and it's an instant fix! Even my older daughter liked them as an 'ice pop' when the weather was hot. They are kind of a pain to clean if you put something like apple or peach in them. But my baby has also gotten tons of use out of it that way, so definitely recommended."
6559,0,"We love Pamper Cruisers. As a mother of twins, we have had to try to find the best diapers. Pampers may be more expensive, but they don't leak. I would rather pay more for a diaper than have to keep buying cclothes becasue they are destroyed."
101242,2,"I was trying to save money by going with these instead of some of the natural diapers (a few cents more per diaper) but I quickly regretted it. I've never had leaks with the natural diapers but these leaked every night. Little gooey balls came out of the diapers and stuck to my daughter's skin whenever they got wet, which I didn't like either. I was so relieved when the natural diapers I ordered to replace these arrived, and I will never use these again!!"
35911,1,"I just had my 3rd baby and someone gave this carrier at my shower. At first, I was thinking that I would return it because I already have 3 other carriers that I used with my older two... that being said, I always complained about how much the others hurt my shoulders, neck and back. I read some reviews about this wrap and decided to give it a try. I have to admit that when I opened it up I almost put it away before even trying it. It looked a little weird and I wasn't quite sure it was worth all the fuss. I stuck in the video and watched it for 2 minutes and decided to try it. It took me about 5 minutes the first time to figure out how to make it comfortable for me and my daughter but after a little fiddling I put my daughter inside. I walked around and tried it out... checking out it would feel... LITERALLY, within seconds my daughter was asleep. I realized that this gave her a cocooned ""womb-like"" feeling and she was so happy and relaxed. The next day I put it on to go for a walk with my family and again, she was asleep in minutes. I walked for about an hour and when I got home, realized that I wasn't in ANY PAIN at all. The carrier didn't pull on my shoulders at ALL!!!! I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah, just for fun put my 18 month old inside also and he loves it as much as the baby!!!! I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS CARRIER!!! Oh yeah, after the 2nd day I was able to whip this carrier on in about 30 seconds flat. It's way easier than any of the others... it just looks a little intimidating, but if you try it on it's AMAZING!!!"
136935,1,My daughter is not really interested in the toys that are attached. The musical toy sounded sick right from the start and she doesn't mess with the squeeker. I always bring other toys. This product is really easy to use and serves its purpose. It could have more padding . I use an extra pillow for support.
62467,1,"have been using the playtex system with my second daughter (who would not take any other bottle). the liners are handy, like the fact that they are bpa free and that you can switch them out."
90121,1,"I've tried many diapers over the years and I've found that Pampers are the best. They fit well, provide the right amount of ventilation so our babies don't get a rash and they hold a lot of liquid. My only complaint is the price. They are so darn expensive!"
42152,1,"This is the best hamper I've ever owned, We ended up buying a second one since I 'borrowed' the ecru one for myself. I ended up getting the pink one for my daughter.It made it so east to do the baby's laundry since the mesh bad is so light, I was able to carry it easily when I was recovering from a c-section and needed to wash the baby's clothes."
80370,0,"Mini Crib mattresses are a challenge to buy... there aren't many, and they never have them in the stores so you can check them out in person. That being said, if fit our Emily well, would have liked it to be firmer/smoother. Its fine for a newborn, but not enough support for long term use."
179700,0,"I LOVE this invention!! I so wanted to stop every single person I saw hauling & lugging around a car seat about this product! It's a smooth ride, pulls easily, my little man loved it... it was easy to push forward too... We bought it on all the positive reviews & recommendations fo friends. Indeed, in the states, we were never asked to take it off, & they would just take it over to a larger scanner at security & return it... in Japan we found that have the car seat face down, still attached, it through their scanners! So it really was worth the efforts!The only issues we encountered... is that though other reviewers & the box both said it wold work with the Safety First True Fit Convertible Car Seat... it did NOT! The car seat kept shifting & falling off the ribs... the more we tightened & cinched to the point the backboard was bending & the tether strap piece was pulling up... the worse it got... that the teeth on the security strap were stripped off. I recommend that the tether point be at the bottom of the backboard so as to help aid in the load & the shifting. My son is only 14 moths old & 23 lbs.... this shouldn't have been an issue. I was careful going over bumps to prevent the shifting but nothing worked. He didn't wiggle or fight his seat... so I am not sure what went wrong. This was a newer modle too... July 2010.All this said & the poor star rating, we are buying another one just to make the trip back to Japan. We really can't see living without it! It totally beat lugging a stroller around & fighting security with it!"
50562,1,I LOVED THIS PILLOW! So much my husband got jealous of it :o) By second trimester I needed something to help me sleep comfortably and this did the trick. I since passed it down to my sister while she was pregnant and she too agrees it is a must have.
72006,0,"I bought this stroller because I bought the matching car seat the britax companion. However, I think I would have not bought the stroller if I had known its capabilities. The stroller is very light weight and easy to open and close with a little technique that I use (to open- push the grey handle down and then with your foot push down on a little black knob until the stroller locks) Although, when the stroller is in its fully reclined position you are unable to use the storage compartment,and there are no cup holders. Although it does come with a handy diaper bag that conveniently attaches to the stoller. Which can hold quite a bit of diapers, travel pack of wipes, extra clothes, a few toys, and a bottle of water (about the size of a crystal geyser bottle). As far as maneuvering the stroller, its okay, I do alot of walking and even some stroller off-roading- and so far its held up but its hard to move over lots of bumps or not quite equipped for dirt paths, and not for one handed use, (ours veers more to the left side). and the sun shade is not deep enough to block the sun out of my daughters eyes. All in all it does the job, and is great with the infant car seat in it."
144438,1,"I have used this product for years. My husband and I are just thrilled that we can now order them in bulk through Amazon since it is cheaper and we never run out. When I use to purchase them in a store I would purchase as many 25 or 50 count bags as they had on the shelf, since many times the store would be out of stock in them.I love the fact that we can carry just a few in our diaper bag. It is great when you go to a restaurant or to visit family or friends and if our daughter has an accident we don't feel bad when we leave a diaper in their waste basket. The fact that each bag smells like baby powder and seals the ""stink"" in the bag when tied shut is great when they are sitting in the garage or outside trash for a few days prior to the trash collectors coming around - ESPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS!! I recommend these to EVERYONE that has a baby and my parents and grandmother love them too. I know we couldn't imagine changing a diaper especially a stinky one without them. Our 23 month old will now grab one out of the basket and bring it to us and say ""oooh...stinky"" when she needs to be changed - it is so cute. My brother just had his first baby, a girl, yesterday and I plan to take them a box to get them started - especially since they live in the county and their garbage is only picked up every other week. I was planning on purchasing them several boxes and having them mailed to them but my baby niece showed up in the world 3 weeks early - so it kind of threw me off."
55453,2,"I would not recommend this product! My baby likes warm food so i ordered it, thinking life will be easier. It does not work! I tried to use it, and it did not work, I had to use a microwave instead."
51197,1,"Well worth the money! This is a high quality necessity! I was initially shocked at the amount my husband spent on it, but its worth every penny and I've already gotten so much use out of it!I firmly believe that EVERY pregnant woman should have one of these! It has been such a lifesaver! My husband got it for me for Christmas and I don't think I'll give it up even after I have the baby! It is nice and soft, yet firm enough to hold its shape, mold to your body and provide support wherever needed.The main picture shows a woman holding it in front of her like a body pillow but I've found that my favorite position is with it behind me. It is long enough to act as a pillow for my head and to wrap my arms around, supports my entire back, and then wraps forward between my knees. It also coils up to support me when I'm sitting in the living area watching tv, and does a great wrap-around thing that will replace the need for a boppy!I would definately suggest also buying the separate cover for it. You'll be spending LOTS of time with this item since it does so many different things and having a cover that you can take off and wash will be much appreciated."
121025,1,"We have used several different types of cloth diapers ( prefolds, fitteds, pockets,etc.) and I think these might be our favorite. We have only had them a few weeks, so we can't comment on how well they hold up over time, but so far, we love them. We haven't had any leaks, even overnight, they are very soft, and they dry in a reasonable amount of time. They are also really cute, and very reasonably priced. Just be aware that they are very large. My daughter is almost three, and has plenty of growing room. This is good for us, because she has Down Syndrome, and it will probably still be a while before she is ready to potty train."
106092,1,I own 2 diaper pails (one for upstairs and one for downstairs). My other pail is the Diaper Dekor which is my favorite of the two. This pail is a close second to the Dekor. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my diapers sometimes get stuck and it seems to smell a bit more than the Dekor. To operate this pail you put the dirty diaper in the hole at the top. You then pull the handle which turns the top over and dumps the diaper in the pail. There is a weight in the top that helps push the diaper into the pail. Occasionally the diaper will get stuck in the pail. When this happens I have to open the pail and push the diaper through with my hand. This doesn't happen too frequently so I'd still buy this pail again.The pros are that it is less expensive than the Dekor and it does not use proprietary bags so it saves you money in the long-run.
128577,1,"The glass bottles are perfect...no plastic to worry about leaching chemicals, dishwasher-safe, surprisingly durable to being dropped by a 15-month old... My only complaint is they came with latex nipples that were hard, as if they were old. I just threw them out and bought the Evenflo silicone nipples. Other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase!"
65755,1,We absolutely love this mobile! Especially the lights that project onto the ceiling and twirl around. Great product! Would recommend it to anyone!
98280,1,"This diaper works very well for night or day. Organic cotton is on the inside, against baby's skin. I have both the snap and velcro kind and I like them both but I like the snap better. I have tried about 30 different kinds of diapers and this is in my top 3."
133758,0,"There is a difference between the 3 kinds of Pampers wipes, not just the cost... and we're not sure what it is besides the cloth material that makes the ""Sensitive"" better... don't have the time to figure it out, tho. She likes them better - case closed."
103164,1,"Read this review with the knowledge that our little one has not yet come along, so this is a review written on our limited experience thus far!We purchased two of these strip covers for our entertainment area where cords are readily accessible. We are confident that our son will not be able to disassemble these for quite some time - and once he has that sort of dexterity, he'll be old enough to understand not to stick his fingers in outlets. The locking mechanisms are effective in keeping it closed while in little, curious hands.As per the reviews that say the opening on top is wide enough for little hands to enter, they're absolutely correct (my hands will almost fit inside so baby hands slip in without a problem). However, we covered unused outlets on the cord with the simple plastic covers and then put these on. No safety precaution can be 100% - but between the individual outlets being covered and the whole strip being covered, we feel confident our little guy will not be able to out-smart the entire contraption before we see what he's trying to do and intervene.My only complaint is that more color options weren't available. There is absolutely not a single piece of white anything in our entire living room so these stand out like sore thumbs. But that's the price we pay to keep our kids safe!"
84871,0,"I purchased this crate in size large for a 45lbs Pit mix. Let me start off by saying the build quality is great. It is very easy and straight forward to put together. The brown is definitely darker than pictured but is very nice. I was looking for something that is more pleasing to the eye in my home and I have to say it looks really good. If my review ended here i would give it five stars.Unfortunately, I have a bit of an escape artist and two stars have to be knocked off just because its not meant for my dog. I was hesitant to make the purchase in the first place. Based on the interior of the crate having the wire crate, I felt that it would work for me and went ahead and ordered. Unfortunately the wire is spaced a bit too far apart. After a week of no problems, my dog just decided she didn't want to be in there anymore. She proceeded to tear holes through the wicker and squeeze herself out. Its amazing how small of a hole a determined dog can squeeze through. So I suppose I should have known better with my dogs track record of escaping every crate i have had so far. She is just too smart and powerful for this type of crate.If your dog is similar to mine, i advise looking for something else. If you have a less mischievous dog and your looking for a well built crate that looks great in your home then look no further. Its a fantastic crate that is well worth the money for that type of dog. If you have an escape artist in the family, then it would be better to light your money on fire because essentially that is exactly what i did!"
142159,1,"I have tried a few different carriers and this is my favorite. The back support is comfortable and supportive and it didn't have to tighten to the point of not breathing like some people have stated. it fits me perfectly at 5'7"" and my husband is comfortable at 6'3"" (I cannot say for shorter people how it feels). It I can say anything negative about it at all it would be the fact that my sons legs/ feet get cold - for that I recommend matching your carrier with a Papooska, I got one as a shower gift - it hooks on the front pack and my dughter loves how it snuggles her in. All in all, I love this carrier and recommend it to all of my friends. I realize the price is steep but if you plan on carrying your child for any lenth of time and you care about your back then price should not be an issue."
162774,1,My son (22 months) loves using these while were away from home. They keep his snacks in the cup and my son occupied while in the car or stroller. I love these cups!
20910,1,"LOVE these diapers! Honestly, I think every little body is built a little differently, and one diaper will not fit every baby perfectly. But these are worth checking out. I tried them looking for a good, cheap diaper and these were recommended by a friend. After reading various reviews I was a little worried, but gave them a go. And I am so glad I did! They have never leaked other than a few overnights, but they sure did put up a fight those nights and even the ""night time"" diapers have had a hard time standing up to my 14 month-old daughter. They are thin, inexpensive and I actually like the smell better than the ""pee smell"" we'd get with others. Only cons- a little crinkly sounding and somewhat transparent (which can be a good or bad thing depending on where you are and what you have). Give them a try, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was!"
64589,1,I was looking for a small gate to block off an enclosed area for my jack russell and this worked great. Easy to use. Great for small dogs!
56579,1,"these are really nice and good quality the only downfall is if you put them in the dishwasher then the bolts on them rust, so I suggest a hand wash"
47101,2,"Be extra sure you want this before ordering as it is difficult to return. We tried to find this in a store and could not find it anywhere so we could not test it out in person, and we ordered from Amazon. After receiving it we realized it was not really what we were looking for (although it seemed like a well built, quality product) so we initiated the return process with Joovy. TWO MONTHS LATER we finally received our refund. Joovy customer service is extremely unorganized. Basically everything they told us was wrong and had to be re-done. They lost our return, they could not find our order, they could not find our receipt, they dragged their feet and were in no hurry to help, one thing after another, they kept saying one thing then another, a complete nightmare. We ended up purchasing theEddie Bauer All-Terrain Tandem Stroller Bryant Collectionand we love it. It is less expensive, more flexible, carries more, and the rear seat folds down horizontal so our infant can sleep. The one drawback is that it is heavier. P.S. Amazon customer service in handling this return was outstanding, 5 stars."
93633,0,"I bought this potty for my 2 and 3 year old boys. My 2 year old fits on the potty very well, however the opening and the height of the potty seems two small for my 3 year old. They love the music but the battery keeps dying. They figured out that if they stomp on the floor near the potty, then the light goes on. Now it is a game. The sensor only works if your child goes a lot at once. My 2 year old gets frustrated when he goes and the music doesn't play. I also have a problem with leaks, and I do make sure that the bowl is in snug. My children like to use the potty, and thats what really counts."
10832,2,"After washing product once it begin to peal up with little fuzz balls. Product is not very durable, I would not recommend it to anyone, there are better products out there."
60543,0,"I bought the Eurobath becouse all the reviews stated how good it was. It was great for 7 1/2 months! My daughter is really active, and she did not want to lay down while I was bathing her. So I tried the sitting postion but she just slipped and slided all over the place. It actually became quite dangerous! I now have the Safty 1st seat that attaches to the bath tub. I will have to see how long this will last."
66384,2,"These handles are great, but the description that lists the colors you may get is incorrect. I received a blue set and a pink set. Having a correct list of the potential colors would be helpful as I would not have ordered these if I had known I may get a pink set for my son."
93659,0,"We returned this product because the musical rewards would go off randomly with nothing passing in front of the sensor. Interestingly enough, often it would fail to chime when you DID pass an object in front of the sensor..."
151748,0,"I had been looking at this shelving unit for quite some time. The design is gorgeous and I love the colors. I finally ordered it from Amazon - it took about two weeks to get to me. There were about 20 wood pieces and a hundred screws and bolts. It took me over two hours to get the shelves together (you need two people) and another hour of extreme frustration to get one of the swinging doors on. The second swinging door was utterly hopeless to screw on straight and I am pretty good at putting stuff together. So, I now have this unit missing a door which is such a drag but it looks okay. Again, the design is very pretty. But the hassle to put it together and the lack of a second working swinging door makes this a RISKY PURCHASE. I'm not sure I'd buy it again in hindsight."
154079,0,I like that this product is chlorine free and unscented as I do not like those chemicals on my baby but this wipe is VERY thin.
105427,1,"My husband & I had received a tip from another parent that this was the must have item. I had always hated that the diaper genie had to have special bags, I was just going to get a regular garbage pail & use that. That is until we heard about the Diaper Champ.I absolutely love it. It is a complete life saver all around. No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together. Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers. A little tip to keep the odor down. I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray. Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent. Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one. It is a sure winner. You'll save a lot of money by using this one."
109453,2,I LOVE the idea of this product but the material makes it very difficult to clean out. My son loves chewing on cold peaches and bananas etc but no matter what we have tried they all mash into the netting making it a 25 minutes task of scrapping it clean with my fingernails and a pipe cleaner. I threw them out after 2 washes from frustration.
58376,1,"These were great for the first two weeks. So far we've had no diaper rashes and are planning to use the next size up when my son fits into them. For now, we are using the Huggies Newborn b/c my son is long and no longer fits into the Pampers Newborns. After two weeks, he started to have heavy bowle movements and they leaked at the top b/c the Pampers aren't long enough on the back. The next size up is considerably larger (for his weight). After reading the reviews, we were not sure about trying the Huggies but they have worked out fine, they just don't hold as much. They're a nice inbetween and I'd recommend those too."
72701,1,"Very perfect, I very like ,This is a very good experience . The next time will continue to be in this shopping ."
28865,1,"This is a great glider for the price point. It was well packaged, so that nothing arrived damaged, and putting it together took less than 15 minutes. I think for this price, the product is excellent."
124918,1,Our seven month old daughter does not like being on her tummy so she does not like to crawl or attempt to crawl. She loves kicking and we got the Johnny Jump Up Bug to help her use her legs more without having to be laying down on her tummy. She loves it. She now loves sitting up and kicking her legs and making herself move around. Since Johnny Jump Up Bug does not have a tray it is easy to get her in and out and she has not come close to pinching her fingers like the reviews for jumpers that have trays usually state. We are very pleased with the quality for it's low price and will use it for our future kids.
113443,1,"When we were looking for an extra booster chair to take to Grandma & Grandpa's home, we first bought the Safety 1st -Grow With Me. The tray was very difficult to take off and put on. Then, we tried the 1st Years-Swing Tray Booster. I was very disappointed with the product as the pivot point on the seat back was already broken when we opened the box and for some reason, there was a gap of about 1/2 inch between the sides and where you connect the back. So,essentially, there was no way these would have connected---bad design.So, I finally read reviews and bought the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster! We have been VERY PLEASED with this product and having tried the two I mentioned above, this is a far superior product! It is a well thought out design with a lot of added features I did not expect.1) Covered tray---this is excellent so when you do transport the booster, you do not have to worry about the baby's eating area getting dirty. It also works great after you eat when the baby has already made a mess and you rather just clean the tray when you get home.2) the carrying strap is a great idea as most of the time, our hands are full with either carrying the baby or the baby's things.3) The restraining belt is a nice design with 2 clips making it easier to strap the baby in and take the baby out.4) The ability to make height adjustments is nice.5) The tray can be taken off and inserted EASILY plus it has multiple adjustments for putting it closer or farther away from the baby.Overall, we are VERY HAPPY with this product--this is definately the one to get for portability and ease...I give it a 5 out of 5."
38271,0,"I loved the extensions, but if you have a strong child, this can be pulled down. Would be good for pets. - Returned the item."
59510,1,"I have this attached to my sons changing table. Keeps things nice and neat. Only gripe is when you are low on diapers and you try to grab only one, more will come out because of the big opening on the bottom. No biggie though, Just keep it stocked! :)"
125713,1,"Cute book, arrived with seam coming apart. We fixed it and it seems to be ok now. The kit inside is very nice to have. I believe it will be a great book just the one problem, but pages are nice and book is nice."
179276,2,"I bought at least 3 dozen of these bottles before my second son was born. I soon learned that the bottles were a pain. First, my son could not get anything out of them, he would be crying to drink and very little formula would come out of these bottles/nipples. Finally I used them with a Gerber nipple and the problem was solved! Then the leaks began, if the bottles were not sealed perfectly (and sometimes when they were) they would leak. Then the cleaning issue. They come apart at the base for the vent and the rubber seal to be washed so it's extra little bottle parts and washing for Mommy. I would not reccomend these to anyone. I am pregnant with my third baby and will stick with Health Flow.!"
21293,1,"I bought this for my 2 year old son for his 2nd birthday because he loves jumping on the beds and couches. He absolutley loves it and I love that it runs out all of his energy before bed. He calls it his jump jump and uses it everyday. I would absolutely recommend this product for energetic toddlers that like to ""jump jump""."
70924,1,"this was a baby shower gift, my friend still uses this after 1 year. great investment, it was sturdy and the colors were bright."
74112,1,"This is my third double stroller that I have purchased, and by far the best one. My 3 year old loves the fact that when he is tired of walking he can sit. It is much easier to deal with in the mall or huge crowds. It is a lot lighter than the other two double strollers that I have had in the past. Overall I love it and would recommend it to anyone!"
167624,1,I used this for my son until he was about 6 months old. It was awesome - he fell right to sleep whenever he was in it since his flailing arms tended to wake him up. There's plenty of material to wrap around even the largest infant and it's easier to figure out than the whole swaddling with the regular blanket thing.Just know that eventually you're going to have to stop using it and the transition will take some time. My husband and I went through some sleepless nights after we stopped using the blanket since our son had to get used to sleeping without it.
165860,1,"I order this item almost every month my daughter has been in size 3's for about 5 months or so. You can not beat the price on this site its pretty amazing. However, I have noticed that with each order it takes longer and longer for them to arrive. Its pretty annoying that they cant seem to get them here any faster and so dont wait to order them if you are going to need them within the next 2 weeks order them cause chances are they will take that long to get there. Pretty sad but with the price I guess they have to mess you up somewhere. I was disappointed because I went off the last time I ordered and the amount of time they took and this time it took 3 days longer. So I had to run to the store and pay full price :(All in all great product Pampers always are but be careful ordering from here when your in a rush!"
131962,0,"I bought this because I live in a one bedroom apt. and don't have a lot of room. A bouncy seat AND a swing? It sounded perfect. For one month it was wonderful. I put my newborn twins in the swing at about 3 weeks and it would immediately put them to sleep. They enjoyed the swinging more than the vibrations. The babies also seem to enjoy the nature sounds. I don't use the music function. The vibrating part gets weaker as the batteries run low. The swing also swings with less force as the batteries run low.After a month it broke. I bought new batteries, but that wasn't the problem. The motor made a sound, but it wouldn't swing. I took the thing apart twice and put it back together. Nothing. I had to call Graco directly because it was past the 30 days that I could contact the online store I bought it from. Graco was very nice and they sent out a replacement motor. It took a week to get here (not so great) and it didn't solve the problem. SO I called Graco again and they said they would send out the non-motor side of the swing because it looked like it was that side that had stopped working properly. They sent me another motor!! So I called them again and AGAIN they sent me the wrong part!It's now been a month that I have not been able to use the swing. I had to speak with a supervisor to persuade them to send me out a new swing, but they insisted that I send in the old one first and then I would have to wait for it to get there and then wait another two weeks to get the replacement. This was unacceptable considering that I have already been unable to use the swing for a month. Finally they agreed to send the new swing and I'm waiting for it now.Do all of these break or was I just unlucky? I'm looking forward to being able to use this swing again. I like it enough that I'm willing to give it another try before I go out and buy a new swing altogether."
92911,1,"Before I purchased the My Cot, I read the reviews about it. Reviewers said their children complained it was uncomfortable because of the horizontal support bar that ran thru the middle. I was concerned but figured I'd put a thick blanket over the cot. When it arrived I was so happy to see that the cot has been redesigned without the support bar! The support now is reenforced fabric so it's very comfortable.My 3 year old son loves it! it's also extremely easy to set up! I'd highly recommend."
55495,0,This product is Okto me but not really good. It can't makes the milk warm enough although it doesn't need too much time.
112133,0,"I tried the cruisers on sale when the Pampers Baby Dry were the same $ amount. I was unhappy with the results. It leaked more often than not. I couldn't put him to bed in them. He had several ""blow-outs"" with them. I won't use them ever again. I'll stick with the pampers baby dry or seventh generation."
31618,0,"I bought the Munchkin Dora 2 packs and my 1 year old loves the images and easily can drink from them, but they leak too much. Also, the stopper inside comes out easily and you only realize it once the water is allover the floor and you baby is crying because she slipped in the water. The images also fade very quickly. I bought them because they were similar to drinking from a regular cup and now need to research what other cups I can buy."
111432,0,"This is a great idea but it is executed with one serious limitaton: it can't be used with the modern ""decora"" style outlets. Those are the ones where the plug sockets are housed in a single rectangular unit, with two screws above and below to attach the cover. This works great with the old style plugs that have two oval plug sockets and a singe screw in the middle to mount the cover. Unfortunately we had our entire house rewired and can't use a single one of these that we bought."
177423,0,"Mine just didn't work with this pump. It wasn't operator error - it worked, it just didn't work well, and it didn't work equally well on both breasts (one is larger). I had to go with an electric, and even then I still would have been better off with a variable shield."
158591,1,"Bought this for my bigger-than-average 8 month old son and I love it! I bought an XL and this would probably fit most kids till they are 18 months old or older.Perfect with a onesie for warm summer nights when you still want them to have something covering them. Excellent quality, supersoft fabric in an adorable print. I have washed it frequently and it just keeps getting softer. Excellent quality zipper, too. Highly recommend."
88166,0,"after reading the wonderful reviews submitted by scores of people on these playmats...i went out and purchased one for my 3 1/2 month old----the first five minutes were great!!! it seemed as if we had gotten him heaven on a mat, but then, then came the crying. you see this is a wonderful toy for a baby who does not like to be held all the time. it is great if your infant is use to lying down and entertaining himself. my baby will play with the toys, sitting up---and since he's not old enough to sit yet by himself---guess who ends up having to play with him----??? so i have decided to now get him one of those stationary entertainers---let's see how that works."
38599,1,"This is a wonderful product for when your baby out grows their infant tub, but can't sit up yet in the big tub. My son loves laying on this during his bath - he loves having lots of room to kick his legs! As long as you follow the drying instructions, you should have no problems with it. Love it!"
53041,2,"First the positive -- the brown cushions fit our coffee table perfectly, will definitely protect our lil one from injury, also they are aesthetically pleasing.However, the tape is completely horrible and considering you need the cushions to stay on --this is a significant issue. Both my husband and I messed with the tape for nearly an hour before we were able to get it to stick, and even now, I am fairly certain that my daughter will be able to rip these off."
46740,1,The swing was recommended by a friend and given as a gift. I also read the reviews on Amazon and that helped too. The baby love the swing which makes everyone happy.
15617,2,"This is junk!My 20 month old grabbed the top corner, pulled & ripped the whole cloth door OFF! Fortunately, I was right there because he headed straight for the stairs! I had to sew the Velcro together with some heavy-duty thread. I would not recommend leaving your child alone with this gate for one second.I will post some pics latter..."
78155,1,"We were looking for something foldable , sleek, comfy and good enough to seat the supported sitter. We bought this when we started our 5 month old on solids - he has never complained to sit on it and he has even napped sitting on it a few times! Love my purchase!"
50431,0,"this pillow is ok, it helps with my back pain but its a bit high for my neck. I normally like smaller pillows so that could be it. Also i dont use this when i sleep at night, its a bit constraining, especially that my bed isn't too firm so i sink in with this large massive pillow. Also as a pregnant lady, i wake up alot at night to make bathroom visits, and its kind of annoying to get out and into this pillow.....I mostly use it when i watch TV or sit in the living room...."
118808,1,"I bought this for my 5 yr old who just hit the 40pd mark. He was so excited to be a big boy! It fit him well, with room to spare, he loves the cup holders. I love the fact that it is easy to use and that it recieved 5 star rating all-a-round for safety by the government web site. I almost bought him the newest version until I found out this one rated higher."
122932,1,"I ordered this swaddler because it states that it can be used from newborn on. I have yet to use it on a newborn, I'm still preggo. However, I did babysit a 2 month old for a friend and used this blanket and he loved it. She had told me he didn't like to be swaddled but in this blanket he slept soundly and did not fuss. I purchased other swaddler blankets for my daughter that used velcro to secure and I was not fond of the sizing or the velcro. With this blanket, gravity, and baby weight is secure mechanism. I would recommend this blanket to any parents. Can't wait to get daily use out of it!"
178440,1,"I had a different carrier w/ my first baby and that one killed my shoulders, especially when my son fell asleep. It seemed like his head weighed a ton. I am wearing the baby bjorn right now and my 9 week old daughter is asleep in it and it's just fine. Very comfortable and she doesn't feel heavy. It definately distributes the weight more evenly than other carriers. I also have a hotsling which is kind of awkward for me and she cries in it...this one works like a charm. She was crying her eyes out 5 minutes ago, I strapped her in which is so easy to do by yourself and now she's sleeping. The carrier I had with my son was a nightmare to put on alone, to me that's useless!"
102011,2,"I first purchased this stroller because it is light. After using it for 6 months I find that it is in fact dangerous. I was taking the car seat out of the stroller when the support bars which hold the seat in place fell to the ground. The screws had come out and keeps coming out. I found that the basket is useless. When the car seat is in place, there is hardly enough space to access the basket. The parent's tray keeps coming off and I often find parts that had come off in the trunk of my car. I'm purchasing another stroller because the one I purchased is dangerous."
50572,1,"Even when I was in my first trimester, this helped me sleep so much better and eased my backpain. Every pregnant woman needs one of these!"
89870,0,"Nothing special to report here, was looking for an overnight diaper for my 21 month old, it does an adequate job, only one or two leaks out of the diaper, but that may have been because it was loose or she was in a position where it was apt to leak. Not bad, not the best, but works well enough, maybe there are other brands out there that perform as well for less dollars."
67483,1,"I actually purchased these as a gift on my daughters reccomendation. As she is about to have baby number 4 I think she is qualified to advise me on gifts for new babies. Thank you, Teresa M, Cawthon"
183790,1,I found the HMF Replete powder to be amazing. My friend recommended it to me when I told her that I felt I was having a terrible candida episode from taking antibiotics for a bad cold. I found relief immediately from the symptoms of the candida! I ran out and tried something less expensive that I bought from my local vitamin store and it can't compare. I was just about to order some more of the HMF Replete when I was asked to do this review. It is worth every penny!
68533,1,This little pacifier pod has been a great addition to our diaper bag. We always know where the binkies are and remember to check for them before we leave the house. Good for keeping them clean and us organized.
136775,1,"You can read all the other reviews on this product and I agree with the good ones! All the features are wonderful, it helps sooth my 4 month old, yada yada yada. The reason I'm writing this review is to help those of you who have thrown away the instructions before reading them..(I mean who needs instructions on how to operate a baby toy... he he he). Anyway, after using this toy with my infant, my only complaint was that the light was too bright and not adjustable. So I read a couple of reviews on the product and everyone was boasting about how great the adjustable light was.... well I checked out LeapFrog's website and found the instructions in PDF format.. Just click the light button, then adjust with the volume control... Wonderful! Could it be any simpler? This is a really great toy and I highly recommend it. I wish I had it when my 3 year old was a baby."
22775,0,"I just opened up the box and was surprised to find that the fabric print is noah's ark, which certainly wouldn't have been our first choice since we aren't religious. I thought it was probably worth posting this info for others since I can't see that it says so or shows it clearly on this ordering page."
108183,2,For a hand pump this was very uncomfortable. It wasn't as powerful as the Evenflo that I now use. Plus I would have to work twice as hard. I used the pumbe about 0-2 times a day and after only 3 weeks it broke. Part of the main area cracked off so that it was no longer air tight. I sugest that you invest the extra ... and get a better pump.
86378,1,I am very happy with this product. I live in apartments and have had no noise issues whatsoever.
156165,1,"My son loved this seat to the nth degree. He long ago out grew it but still enjoys the music and singing voices naming the fish, lion and bird. We took it away from him at 13m for our newborn to start using; he refused to stop playing and would crawl in and sit there dancing with his feet hanging off the bottom just happy as could be. Our newborn rarely got it to herself without him coming to show her what he knew about it so she was not as enthrawled as he was. Anyway, the batteries last forever and we used both the vibration and lights daily. I'm sure someone will disagree with this, but our daughter slept in this for her first 8 weeks perfectly. We needed her to not wake the house every 3 hours and as soon as she ate the vibrations soothed her back to sleep. Im happy that was a fleeting need she had."
124516,1,"I bought this set of stacking cups for my great-nephew, who recently turned 1 yrs. old, for his birthday. He loves them! I have been told they are some of his absolute favorite things to play with, so I am very pleased with my purchase!"
30318,0,"This is a fine product for the price. The quilt is really cute and all accessories are holding up very well. However, the bumper doesn't tie at each corner, it does fall short at almost every side. The crib skirt is pretty flimzy and difficult to put on. But it's a pretty set and I think worth the low cost. Also, I wouldn't describe the blue as any variation of navy; it is much lighter, more like cornflower."
83144,2,"I'm sure this is a product many enjoy, however, I would borrow someone's after the baby is born to see if your baby will enjoy it. Mine did not. It was hard to maneuver, I felt like the baby was too constricted, and worst of all he screamed when placed in it."
80645,1,I got a savings code out of parents magazine and stacked it with the coupon for 1.50 off and the discount for subscribing. You can't find a lower price. You can cancel it at anytime which is very nice. I liked these better than pull ups as they seemed to fit better on my toddler. They were more snug and don't have velcro on the sides so she cant take them off other than to pull them down which I think is good to learn for potty training.
101388,1,"Chain was as described, the price was right, and arrived as expected. It is very durable in holding my daughter's 20+ stuffed animals."
150418,0,"It's nice, not great. It's small, very small and for the price I would've expected something better. I need another baby hamper and I just can't see myself spending this much again, it just seems overpriced now."
73840,1,"The product works great as intended. It keeps track of feeding time and stuff. However, we stop using it after about a month. We have our twin babies back and forth between their bedroom and living room. It's too much of a hassle to go find it and reset the timer. Also, it cannot keep track of how much they ate and how many times they pee or poop. We end up making a chart on a wall and enter it by hand. It would be nice if Itzbeen can do all of the above."
2927,1,"I had received this Boppy product from my shower and have used it everyday since. If you intend to breastfeed your baby, hold your baby for long periods (and want to sit on the sofa comfortably), take pictures of your newborn propped up, get this product. It has helped me immensely with breastfeeding alone and every NEW mother knows how hard this can be. The Boppy is an &quot;extra hand&quot; to help support your fussy new one who is learning how to breastfeed with you! Definitely a must have!"
84292,1,"I bought this swing when my daughter was 7 months old and have not had any issues with it. She immediately loved it. She loves to be outside and watch her surroundings. She is now 11 months old and still loves it. She is very comfortable and content in it, so much she has even fallen asleep. I have not had any safety concerns with this and it has not tipped at all. I do not allow other kids to push her though."
47972,1,"My sister's second child learned to crawl and walk right about the time her first mastered the stairs. Their first gate gave up the ghost so I got them this one after my sis picked it out. I like it better, but I rarely need to use it. They seem happy with it and my little nephew can open it (and close it behind him, he's very careful about that) without too much effort."
107410,1,"The first month-and-a-half that we owned this product, it worked perfectly. No problems with static, we could understand someone talking on the other end, it picked up every sound (could easily hear the baby breathing), and we had no trouble with losing the signal in our 2400 sq ft home. However, after that time, we started to intermittently hear static over the sounds from the baby. This lasted for about a week before we were only hearing the static with no transmission from the baby's unit. Of course, we were very irritated by this since it rather defeated the purpose of having a baby monitor. We didn't have the sales receipt, so we didn't think we'd be able to return it to the place of purchase. Thus, we bought a monitor from another company. However, we absolutely hated it and were missing the features of the Summer Infant monitor. I decided to call the company and complain, only half expecting them to do something about it. I was quite surprised (and pleased) by how the company stepped up to support their product. They took the necessary information and agreed to send us out a new one at no charge. Unfortunately, that monitor was stolen from our front step (as evidenced by the FedEx delivery confirmation). I called Summer Infant back, and even though I couldn't prove that the monitor had been stolen, they sent us another one at no charge to us. The second monitor arrived without incident and so far (it's only been about 2 weeks) is functioning perfectly. However, should we begin to experience problems again, I wouldn't hesitate to contact them. Now, even though I have been very pleased with the company and like the monitor in general, I can't give it a 5 star rating, mainly because I think they at least need to add a feature where you could manually change the channel. We assumed that the occasional split second gap in transmission you hear is the monitor searching through the channels. Said sound gap can be somewhat irritating, although, I haven't noticed it as much in the new monitor (they did say they had changed some things since our model was manufactured, so this may have been addressed)."
955,2,these daipers are no good to use.. always leaks and gives diaper rash.. not worth the money.. Pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers.
167300,1,"My husband's Mom bought one of these for my daughter when she was just turning 1 and was ready to turn around and face front. She just turned 4 and we are still using it and it still looks and feels great. The fabric and the chair itself are very comfortable for my daughter and the chair is very sturdy. The way it is designed, it's hard to explain but when she is sitting in it the sides and back kind of envelope her a little bit to offer a little side protection.The cover pulls off for easy cleaning and the rest of the seat and the straps can then be washed with a hose or in the tub, if necessary. Installation was no problem either. I have a '99 Jeep Cherokee so I have no Latch system and have to use a shoulder belt but have never had a problem getting a tight fit. I've taken it out before so someone could ride back there and it takes less than 5 minutes to get it back in. Size has never been an issue either, but we have plenty of room back there. It might be an issue in a smaller car but really, I'm glad she has plenty of room in her seat and some extra padding in case she needs it.I just bought a Britax Frontier for her which she also loves and fits in well, and my now 1 year old daughter is going to inherit this seat. It may be a little more expensive than the other seats out there, but it's worth every penny and will last a long time."
79868,1,"Yes, it takes two hands to operate, but it does the job we wanted it for. Kitten has given up trying to unspool the TP. Yay!"
57826,2,"The diaper holder is a great convenience. The warmer unfortunately is more of an inconvenience than anything else. The lid does not close tightly enough, so all the diapers dry out. By the time you get to the bottom ones, they are so dry and burnt, you may as well use cold wipes!"
33239,1,"This is one of the best purchases we have made! We have an 11 month old son. Around 5 months we decided it was time to get a gate for the top of the stairs, but we have a staircase that is 52 inches wide. This really limited our choice of gates.After looking at what was available, we decided on this gate. I was impressed as soon as we took it out of the box. It looks really nice, unlike the baby gates we've seen at other homes. It is also very sturdy...our son is pretty strong at 11 months, and he can grab and shake the gate without a problem.The installation was a bit tricky. It took my husband about an hour, which for something with only 6 screws is a bit long. The template was off, and he found one of the screw holes he drilled was about 1/4 of an inch off.I would give this product about a 2.5 for ease of installation, but a 5+ for sturdiness and appearance. Since the install was only 1 hour, and we've now used it for several months and really love the gate, it deserves a 5 star rating."
46089,0,"I was initially intrigued by this mobile's low-tech simplicity, but it did not keep my son's interest for very long. I ended up clipping the WF art cards to another electronic mobile."
180252,1,"This is an awesome product! I've purchased and tried to use two other breast pumps, one of them being the Avent Isis. Neither of them worked very well or were as easy to use as the Harmony. There are very few parts and it's extremly easy to take apart and put together. I highly recommend this product!"
72676,1,"I love this Born Free training cup. The spout is nice and soft and my 6 month old loves it! I bought it when she was teething and put some ice water in it. When she chews on the rubber spout, cool water drips into her mouth and seems to provide some relief and distraction. She does manage to get the water all over herself, but for summertime, it's an added form of fun. So far she is learning that she has to put the spout end in her mouth, and that she has to tip the cup; she's also getting used to swallowing the liquid when it comes out into her mouth. All in all this cup has been great fun for her and something new to learn."
119045,1,"I LOVE this pillow. Most amazing breast-feeding aid ever! Doesn't kill my back and is comfy for baby. Beware of the color. It seems on the page that you will be purchasing an aqua colored pillow. It actually is light blue, which I don't mind but was a bit disappointed. I was hoping for the exact color as the picture displayed. Overall, great purchase!"
132942,1,This diaper pail is great because it can hold a lot of diapers and has a great little flap that keeps the diaper smell trapped away. I totally recommend this product.
151038,1,I bought this for my sister's car. It stays in there all the time and my daughter absolutely loves it. She loves ariel which is the main reason that I bought it. No complaints.....
182462,0,"It's a fabulous moisterizer. Thick, not greasy. Used it on my hands and they felt so soft for hours. However, the smell is pretty strong for a baby and it is a masculine sandalwood type of smell. I gave it to my husband to use, it will suit him since the smell is so masculine."
19145,0,"I have to admit I'm not much of a baby-wearer to start. My son doesn't like to be confined. But, that being said, this sling has been a life-saver a handful of times. Once when he wouldn't nap in his stroller at a friend's BBQ I put him in the sling and he passed right out. And it's also comes in handy for the grocery store when I don't want to mess with the baby bjorn. I'm giving it three stars, however, because I don't think this thing would hold up with daily use. It seems a bit ""homemade"" for that and I don't trust it to hold my son's weight entirely - I am always partially holding him, carrying some of his weight."
13663,1,"The freestanding pet gate is a huge improvement over the permanently mounted or the pressure held gates. It provides the necessary security and yet is easy and safe to traverse or move. Additionally, it is a beautiful piece of quality furniture designed to compliment any home. My only regret is that I didn't know about these sooner."
124313,2,"This fell off after about 2 weeks of use. It seems so flimsy anyway that I didn't bother to put it back on. I'm wishing I had spent a little more money and got a more secure toilet lock, because I'm going to have to end up doing that anyway..."
20197,1,"These are the first VentAire bottles I've used, and I'm impressed! The air bubbles really do vent out! My baby wasn't too great about taking a bottle before, but he actually started drinking from these. He seems to like the nipple. I like the angled shape of the bottle because it makes for a more comfortable feeding.The one draw back to these bottles is that there are two extra parts to clean. But if I'm washing a bottle anyway, it's really not a big deal. I also like that the bottom comes off because It allows for better cleaning."
15810,2,I love how it keeps the baby nice and warm!But when I washed it the the Velcro shreds and makes a mess and unable to be used.I have followed the instructions.I returned it thinking it was a defect come to find out the 2nd one did it too! Besides that I did not even dry it! Very upset about it!
1512,0,"Still the great diapers we've grown to expect from Pampers, but I wish there was some way of knowing whether or not the diapers possessed the wetness detector strip. I'm neither used to nor fond of the squeeze test, so I much prefer the visual (in addition to the inevitable vocal) signs."
132336,0,"Got this after friend said had to get a wipes warmer but didn't use the warmer function much. Felt like it was wasting electricity and drying out wipes. So we mostly use it unplugged (detaches from most of cord/plug). It is a very nice case for wipes otherwise and works as advertised. It's heavy so it stays nicely in place when you're trying to pull a wipe out one handed. Pull out wipe first and hold in hand a little to warm up as getting ready for diaper change helps. We also live in warm climate so that helps. If you live in colder climate/house, a warmer might be more useful."
113951,1,"Our son is VERY big for his age. He was too big for the typical restaurant highchairs, but not old enough to understand that you must remain seated in restaurant booster seats. We got this chair after much research and we absolutely swear by it!! We throw it in the back of the car and it's ready for restaurants, fast food and great-grandma's house! We love the straps (back, bottom and crotch) and when we aren't using the strap around the bottom, our son plays with it to keep out of trouble. The best feature is the ability to change the height of the chair to fit the table!! It's so great!!!!!"
105325,1,"I love this product. It's easy to use, there is no odor, and it uses regular trash bags instead of expensive refills. You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck. It is a little stiff to open, however, this is a good thing when your child is old enough to open it themselves."
14388,2,"After breastfeeding my baby girl, I decided to switch to a bottle and chose these because of their ""reputation"" of being ""good"". I would definitely not recommend them. She had more milk on her than in her! I have switched to the Playtex VentAire with great success."
105543,1,This was a product that the new mother had chosen as one of her preferred gifts. I was pleased with the quality & I know that the new mother found this to be invaluable in the nursery
174169,2,Like all the other reviews i like the way this swing looks and operates but the swing is to fast for baby! heck i don't even think there are six speed settings.. each one is fast with little or no variation between. if i felt like timing the rocks per minute i'd guess the lowest to be 45 per minute and the highest 47 or so. don't be fooled by the six speed gimick.
96327,2,"i hate it, it leaks, separate to 5 parts to wash, and diffcult to put it back together, will not recommend this to any friends."
80478,1,I like that it softer and slimmer than Huggies. It helps me know when I should change my son diapers. I only wish it has elastic in the back to protect the leak soil.
68525,2,"When I saw the price of roughly $30, I thought that's reasonable for a case of six, as that is about what I used to pay when buying refills at Target. Imagine my dismay when the package arrived with one lousy refill! Very disappointed! I guess it was my fault for assuming I was getting a case, but $30 for one refill--I could have just upgraded to a new Diaper Genie for that price. Boo. Hiss!"
95222,0,"I liked this bottle warmer because my BreastFlow bottles fit well in it. And from reading other reviews, the bottle doesn't have a button at the bottom that needs to be pressed to turn it ON. So, it's ON when it's plugged in. I like it. It was working well... until today. It just stopped working. I wiggled the cable & connector around and NOTHING. We didn't even use this for 4 months! And, we only use it 2 to 3 times a week. I am so disappointed. I'd like to purchase this item again, but it may be worth trying something else. The problem is, there really isn't anything else."
30777,0,"Picks up a lot of interference versus the previous monitors we had (in the same spots), reciever makes a lot of noise if transmitter is turned off first. Nightlight is a nice feature, otherwise it's rudimentary. Have not been happy with graco baby monitors durability either."
29986,2,"The crib I have bought is the standard size. Another crib set I bought from other place fits well. But the bumper in this crib set is too short in each side and the ruffle can't be put on, either. I have to return it."
142222,2,"This is my second Bjorn. I can't believe I thought this was a Swedish product. Talk about false advertising. My poor baby has licked so much of this....how awful! We have really tried to rid our home of made in China baby products. It's not easy.I think it's really shameful that Bjorn pretends it's a Swedish product. Imagine the fat margins on this product!! It's about the same price it was 10 years ago when it was made in Sweden.By the way, my son is 18 lbs and after 20 minutes or so, this carrier hurts."
115023,0,"We bought this pump as an emergency backup. It is good enough to be a cheap item that you keep in your car, but I'd never have considered this to replace my Medela Pump In Style Advanced.The reason why the dual pump gets lower reviews than the single is that the second pump is daisy-chained off the first -- so you're getting the same amount of suction for both breasts (you can use only the one at a time, though). Not conducive to pumping more than a couple of ounces, if you're lucky. The four-ounce capacity of the bottles is rather optimistic, in my opinion, especially since the entire unit can run on 3 AA batteries.So, if you're stuck somewhere and desperately need to pump off a bit of excess, you can use this unit. It rates better than a manual pump simply because at least you don't end up with sore hands as well. Understand, however, that you'll still have to hold onto the pump(s) as you go -- so driving while pumping is out of the question!"
133253,1,"I really needed a new set since I had my son 17 months ago. I used the one from the hospital for that long, steamed multiple times a day and just wore it out. I felt I wasn't getting the same suction I used to so switching really helped. It fits the symphony pump perfectly."
109800,1,Good quality here. My 8 year old fell off the bed and broke her arm so we wanted to try and make things safer. I know this is for younger kids but it seems like it could keep her safe and I can rest a bit easier until she become less of a wild sleeper.The length is good and I like that it's metal mostly.
173990,1,We finally found a swing that our daughter loves. She loves to be rocked in the swinging motion and after two weeks we finally found this swing to work the best for her. I think it swings slow enough on the slowest setting. Some other users may disagree. It is definitely worth the money and would recommend to anyone!
149282,1,"Very cozy, great for watching TV on the couch or in bed. I chose this over a regular ""J"" shaped pillow because you don't need to wrestle under the sheets to roll over. I only gave 4 stars because I feel that the leg portions of the pillow could be stuffed more firmly. I'm only 5'5"", I'm not sure the leg portions are long enough for someone over 5'9""."
175475,2,"I read the reviews and thought...hoped this product would be adequate for my simple needs: holding back a handicapped housecat. Well, it can do that, however it is remarkably weak and poorly designed. I had low expectations for the price and was willing to take the chance, but in hindsight I would have paid twice as much for something twice as strong and more secure in closing and opening. Really...I don't see this gate holding back a rambunctious cockerspaniel let alone a toddler. To say I would not trust this at the top of a stair for a child would be an epic understatement! I'm sorry...wish I had a kind word here, but if I owned the company I'd rename and remarket this as an ""economy small pet gate."""
74968,1,"I have a [...] daughter with special needs and she is into EVERYTHING!!!! I needed a gate to keep her out of one of our rooms (the doorway was larger than a normal door and so a regular gate would not work). I had tried blocking the room with furniture, however she would figure out how to get into that room! I found this on line and WOW! She can not get into this room at all!!!! She has tried! She tried to pull it down or climb over it and she is not able to get in. Also, this is very easy to step over for me (I am 5 feet 2 inches). I am very happy about this product and have nothing bad to say about it!"
10847,0,"I have all three sizes of these pads. They work great on changing tables and for cleaning up messes. I carry one in the car and one in the diaper bag. However, they are not the softest products on the market and pill badly when washed. I am careful not to use them anywhere that my son will be on his stomach for fear of him getting the pills and fibers in his mouth and nose."
82840,1,We got the sleep sheep as a shower gift and have used it almost every day for 8 months. After all of this use we have only changed the batteries once. I loved it so much that now that I'm buying one for a friend.
125616,1,I ordered this for my grandson. He loves it! I may order another one. Thanks!
152286,0,"I was excited when I discovered this product b/c I thought it would help me transition my baby from sleeping in the bouncy seat and into the crib. It didn't end up helping much. I only tried it once. My baby would always cry if I put her in the crib awake/drowsy. When I turned on this vibration it did help her go back to sleep. However, 15 mins. later, the vibrations turn off automatically which woke her up and she was screaming bloody murder and it was even harder to get her to go back to sleep.There is a function that you can turn on that auto detects when the baby moves and turns on the vibration again. I didn't try it, but it wouldn't have been helpful for me since the second the vibrations stopped my baby woke up anyway. That is just how she is, even with her bouncy seat. So I don't know if it is necessarily the fault of the device. I wish the device had an option to just leave the vibration running.We did find use in the night light function, using it in the middle of the night when we had to administer tylenol - just turned it on and woke up baby slightly, then turned off and pat her back to sleep immediately without having to pick her up."
129316,1,"My 5 month old loves this toy. When she was learning to grab things, this had plenty of parts for her to grasp. Now that everything is going into her mouth, it also acts as a great chew toy. It rattles for a little extra entertainment as well. I can't wait to give one as a gift to other new moms."
31099,1,"I bought this stroller nearly a year ago, when my baby was a newborn and my older daughter was 2.5. I had a Graco infant carrier that fit snugly with the universal adapter, but now my baby sits in the front with the snack/cup holder tray. I have been everywhere with this stroller--airport, Disneyland, zoo, malls, walks in the park--and I still love it as much as when I bought it. The parent organizer is the perfect size for my wallet, sunglasses, cell phone, iPod, keys, and water, plus extras like Kleenex and hand sanitizer for the kids. Then I stick my spare diaper & changing pad in the basket underneath the seats, and I'm good to go all day! In the airport, I actually stick the baby in my Ergo and load up the front seat with our carry-on luggage.My 3.5 year-old loves this stroller as well. It's true that with the infant carrier on the front seat, she couldn't quite sit up straight on the back, but that never seemed to bother her. She loves having the option to sit, stand, or walk when we're out. I get compliments on this stroller nearly every time I use it.I read many reviews before settling on this stroller, and it's important to know that this is not an umbrella stroller or a jogging stroller, and it doesn't have the conveniences of both. But I wasn't looking for a side-by-side stroller because it seems like those never fit anywhere, and I don't like the design that has one child sitting behind and practically underneath the other child. This stroller is light, but long (which it has to be, since it's carrying two children). It doesn't exactly turn on a dime, and I have to slow down a bit more to go up and down curbs without a ramp (again, because it's carrying nearly 60 pounds of children). But I've never had any problem with the wheels like I read in other reviews.I drive a mid-size SUV and it takes up half the floor space in my trunk. It can get smaller if you remove the canopy and tray but I've never needed to do that.I would absolutely buy this stroller again, and I have recommended it to several friends. It is exactly what I wanted in a double-stroller."
77713,1,"This chair is small enough to dump under the stroller, allowing us to visit restaurants on our route. At 6 months old, our son is not ready for most high chairs that the restaurants provide.Pro:- Easy to carry around- Easy to store in an apartment- Looks nice- Son seems comfortable in itNeutral:- You really need to know how to use it (i.e. read the instructions!). Pitfalls like having a chair underneath or using on a one legged table are important to avoid.Cons:- We haven't used it enough to have problems cleaning it yet, but like others have said it seems hard to clean.******RECALL******Also note that if your chair has metal clamps (like in the Amazon picture above) it is subject to a recall. The company will send you some nice new rubber grips to put on the clamps to reduce the chance of slipping.[...]"
52075,1,"Our baby gets very hot no matter what he is resting in, especially his car seat. What we love about the Baby Bjorn Air is the breathable material that keeps our baby from getting hot after a few minutes. In addition, it's much easier to strap together than the other carrier we had. It takes all of about a minute to get him secured. Finally, our baby feels so safe that he actually naps while I am doing chores around the house. Best $80 ever!"
78528,1,"I worked full time and thanks to this pump I was able to breastfeed for a year!!! Due to the size, I was able to inconspicuously take this to work with me and pump 10 oz in about 20 minutes on my breaks. If you are not drinking enough, then you will not produce enough milk - that is not the pumps fault! My daughter only had a few formula bottles the entire time I was breastfeeding. It is a little loud, but the size and price was the most important thing to me!"
163399,1,I was veey pleased with the high chair. The delivery was very good. It was e My very thing we wanted. Nothing was missing.My grand daughter was very pleased. She is expecting her first child in April.
122752,2,"We have a convertible car seat that doesn't have a canopy to protect our newborn from the sun so I bought this shade, hoping it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it didn't. We installed the canopy on our car seat, which is rear-facing right now due to our baby's small size, and it only provided a little bit of protection. The sun was still shining right in his face. Maybe it works on the smaller infant car seats but it didn't work for us. :-("
109575,2,"I thought it's a good idea to introduce finger food to my baby by starting with this fruit feeder. However,the material of the mesh was not soft enough (at least for my baby) and kind of hard for the little one to take a bite. He only put it into his mouth once and never wanted it again. I still give it two stars because he still play with it sometime and will chew on the holder part of it as a teather, so two stars for being a teether instead of a complete waste."
19000,1,"I was looking for something to take to family get-togethers and didn't want to haul my full-size high chair to and fro. I looked into boosters and was not wanting to spend too much but wanted something I felt was safe to put our daughter in. This wasn't the cheapest nor was it the most expensive. But, we have been very satisfied with it. The thing I really love is that the tray stays on. Yes, a little tight to snap on but we don't want our daughter to be able to pop it off. She actually loves to sit in it. It's a breeze to clean up and can be folded up and taken anywhere. We are doing a road trip to see family in May and this will definately be taken along. Oh yes! The other great thing is when you no longer need the straps and tray you still have a booster for those youngsters that are still in need of a regular booster."
167987,1,"I used these with baby #1 in 2010. So glad they're still around. They have BOTH ubilical cord cut out, wetness indicator, and they have never leaked on me."
107803,0,"I ran out to buy this at the suggestion of a lactation specialist in the hospital where I delivered our first child. She swore by it; however, I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS! Most mentioned the neck breaking and sure enough the neck cracked within 5 weeks of purchase and I only used the pump twice a day. I felt this item was a bit costly to be so fragile, so I called the company and they tried to imply that I was using ""hard"" water to wash the bottle. Ridiculous! Nevertheless, they sent me a free replacement neck and nozzle and since I don't use it as much now as before, I don't know whether it will hold up longer. The manual hand pump makes regular usage uncomfortable for your wrist, and I found that the rubber breast guard gets soft and floppy against the warmth of your skin, thereby releasing the hold and making spillage unavoidable. I didn't want to pay the extra money for a better unit, but in hindsight I should have."
184643,1,"I bought this sheet as a spare to go with the bright imagings theme. I washed it in hot water and it fit perfectly on my standard sized mattress. It is soft, the color stays after washing. I recommend this sheet to anyone."
64450,1,"I absolutely LOVE my new pet gates! They are PERFECT! No more killing myself climbing over the children's gates that were way to high to climb over hundreds of times a day! They are very well made, sturdy and well thought out when designing. I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone! In fact I am ordering 2 more tonight!"
125714,1,I love this baby book. I love how it has a foot print kit inside.
120793,1,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, and went with 4 because my gates (I have two) haven't failed in any major way yet. We've had them for about six months and my daughter hasn't been able to knock them out of place, even by ramming her wagon into them repeatedly. And they're not as expensive as some gates, which is a big part of why I got them.The main reason for this review is to share a way to hold the gates open when they're not needed, like after bedtime. I keep a size large binder clip on the vertical bar closest to the door (ie, the latch-side bar below the plastic part with the two screws). When my daughter isn't around, we flip the binder clip's arm out so it prevents the door from closing all the way.Otherwise, here are my gripes: the instructions make a fuss about how the gates can never be used without the screw-in wall mounting cups. But that's exactly how they're sold to be used, as someone willing to screw holes in the wall has no reason to buy pressure-mounted gates. Also, the pressure-mount pieces have a textured rubber pad that serves no purpose other than to hold them in place in lieu of mounting cups. It would be fine to sell the gates as for use with or without the mounting cups, but the instruction's admonishments to always use them are clearly disingenuous preemptive litigation defense, which I find very annoying.As for the gates themselves, the top latches pretty much never work, but the gates can be used without them. The bottom latches aren't too dependable either and the gates often swing out one way and then the other before latching. And one of my gates doesn't always automatically swing closed like it should. None of these defects have mattered to me yet, but they could be problematic if you have a more aggressive kid (or a pet) and disaster would result if they got through the gate -- for example, if you put it at the top of stairs. Finally, some of my rubber pressure-mount pads look like they're coming off. If they do, the gates will be much less dependable.So 4 stars for now because of the relatively low price and lack of major failure. I'll try to update this review if the latter changes."
77872,1,"I bought these Huggies diapers online for a great price with free shipping. When I opened them up, I noticed that the diapers were thinner and more rough (my son has dry skin around the waist and legs from them) than the ones I had just purchased at Target. Just a coincidence or do they make a lesser quality for online bulk purchases??"
86071,1,"I purchased this from a local store when I was pregnant and loved the product. A year later I dropped the monitor down a flight of stairs and the video portion broke. I lived for two weeks with just the audio when I broke down and bought another one. Once you can see what your little one is up to in his crib, you won't want to go without it! The range is pretty decent, we're able to garden outside and it just barely reaches our fire pit out back maybe 120 ft or so? The picture is excellent even in the dark. My only minor complaint is the battery doesn't last long enough on the monitor so I have to keep it plugged in at night or I'm awakened by the sound of static when the battery dies after about 6 hours on a full charge. Still, I recommend this product to my friends and family!"
33719,0,"This would be a fine product if you have an opening with wood on both sides, but do not use if its just drywall. Within 2 days the supporting hardware pulled out of the wall and left the gate unsafe and useless.Honestly though this could be a very nice product in the right situation."
64220,1,I absolutely love this stroller. It is so easy to use and is great for traveling. I make sure I take it wherever I go. I highly recommend this stroller to everyone!! It is a definite must have.
119200,1,"We got this at our baby shower and I kept on using it until a few days ago - our baby just turned 4 weeks :-).It really helps in latching the baby on and seems comfortable for him. Also, especially if it is a ""big boy"", like ours, having him on it makes it easier to hold him. BUT: while it is not rocket science to put it on, it takes some ""experience"" to do it one handed, with the baby in the other...I sure would recommend it at least until the new mom figures out how to nurse the ""relaxed"" way, with the baby in your lap."
52124,1,"Great price compared to the very expensive Britax Regent[...]and Sunshine Kids65 [...]I did a ton of research to find a 5-point harness for my 2 year old who is 45 lbs. I based my decision on price and reviews from various websites. This seat is comfortable, light weight, and easy to install. My only concern is the shape and position of the bunkle. After adjusting the crouch strap to the 3rd position (the one furthest out), the bunkle still digs into my toddler's cute but rather chucky thighs. I would recommend this seat for the budget-tight family; however, if you've got the cash go for the Britax."
149486,1,Never had a leak with these; never had a diaper rash. What more can you ask for such a reasonbly priced diaper?
98649,1,"My two 1/2 year old outgrew his last seat (too tall for shoulder harness points), and I wanted a really safe seat that would last the remainder of his car-seat/booster years. It fits quite well in a 2008 Toyota Rav-4. The set-up was easy. It's a heavy seat, but we're not moving it from vehicle to vehicle. It is apparently as comfortable as it looks. My son naps quite well in this seat. He recently set a personal record with a 3-hour nap on a cross-country trip to see family. He actually looks comfortable while sleeping as opposed to his last seat in which he looked like a chiropractic ad while snoozing. I'm quite pleased with this purchase."
114490,0,"I bought this booster seat to complement the exact same one I bought a few years earlier for my first child. There are so many things I like about it. I like the removable trays, the portability, the way it folds up for carrying, the straps to secure it to a chair, the built in seatbelt, and the height adjustability, all for a reasonable price. However, when I received this one, for some reason, there was no hole in the carrying handle on the back of the chair unlike the other one I own. This made it much more difficult to carry. That was the only disappointment."
39342,1,"We borrowed our neighbors exact same chair, only it was almost 15 years old... it was magnificant... so we bought this one! It is exactly the same except with better safety straps (thank GOD) and as easy to use. It fits any table, folds down compactly and can go to restaurants or on vacation with you with little to no hassle. My 3 year old sits in it at 35 pounds (1 pound from the recommended limit) and it doesn't budge. The tray on the front can give you fits. It is too snug and a bit of a finger pincher but you truly don't need it. I recommend this highly. It is a bit more expensive than some others that come with extra, extra safety features, but we tried the less expensive, more &amp;amp;quot;secure&amp;amp;quot; seats and they were a hassle and not compatible with all tables. Stick with GRACO! They seem to know what they are doing."
92677,2,my three year old son can open the sliding door by pulling on the door until this door lock snaps off the door.Going with a bar style lock.Save your money.
152738,1,"Love it!! I've had the mc claren for my first child but had such a sore back from bending down all the tiime.This looks like a bugaboo but is better, its higher, and slimmer and easy to get into and out of restaurants and shops etc..Ive had it for my little girl since she was born and she sleeps in it like it's her thrown!I wedged one of those pillows so infants don't roll in the stroller and she sleeps sound and safe since birth.I thoughrally recomend this stroller!!x jodie"
85722,1,"I bought this table cos of the affordable price range and am so proud of my purchase , I used bins for storage nd it's been working perfectly for my 9 month old son ever since ... I Plan to use it as a toy storage rack later, so definately a value fr ur buck !!!PS had no odor issues or bad paint chipping off like few of the reviews say"
91555,1,"I bought this stool for potty training. The steps were a nice height. It's a very nice looking stool, it doesn't look all tacky or cheap like many of the plastic ones, or even some of the painted wood ones. However, since it was used for potty training, it took some... abuse, if you know what I mean. It doesn't look like it did when I bought it a few years ago. But, it still looks nice. In some bathrooms we have used it in, keeping the bottom step pulled out makes it big and interferes with the door opening. We actually just keep the bottom pushed in all the time. I realize in hindsight that the bottom step was not very useful for us. Our kids needed it for a very short time - the top step is low enough that they can climb onto it. The only thing I don't like is that it's pretty heavy, and the kids like to push it around between the potty and the sink, but it's a bit hard for them to move."
46599,1,We use this rail on our king size bed to protect our daughter from rolling off the bed when she sleeps there.
5161,1,"I bought a case of these for my daughter who weighed 13 pounds at the time and was wearing a size 2 in Pampers. When they arrived I could barely get them around my daughters waist! They are super soft and good for the environment but please note that they run small. I would suggest ordering a size up to be safe so you are not stuck with tons of diapers you can't use, like me!"
91646,0,"We recieved this playmat at our shower along with the Baby Einstein playmat. My son LOVES the Baby Einstein mat but is pretty bored by this one. On the Baby Einstein mat, he kicks his feel and waves his arms while smiling away, but on the Fischer Price mat he just lays there.The toys are hanging too high for him to hit to activate the bird's movement, and on the flip side, the bird hangs too low. I tried lowering the toys with some extra lincs and one of them hit him in the head and since they're hard plastic, it made him cry. I have to position him with his feet next to the base of one of the bars so he can kick the bar to activate the bird. The bird just doesn't interest him at all, it moves pretty jerky and doesn't have anything flashy to attract and keep his attention.The mat does have lots of cute things for tummy time play, the one advantage of this mat over the Baby Einstein mat. But I'd still say that if you have an active little baby who's hard to entertain, this playmat isn't for you."
26359,1,I just had my fourth baby in October and really researched prior to choosing a swimg for this baby. Here are a few reasons why I LOVED this: 1) hanging mobile (swing w/ mobile GENIUS) 2) plug in (save $$$ on batteries) 3) Colors (decorative and able to coordinate!)Well worth the money - Take it from a mom of 4!!!
19583,1,"That's what you use this for? I got these as a gift without the box and I just pop these suckers in when my girl need a lift before I go out on the town. Everyone loves touching my boobies when I wear them and it adds protection to my cargo! Plus, it feels great when someone is trying to lick you with these things on. I would highly recommend this product to anyone, breast feeding or not!"
86965,1,"I have bought these bottles since my son was born now he's 3 and I just had a daughter and they are our fav. my baby has gas problems so this helps just when i bought they shipped 2 blue and 1 green I was looking at picture and was trying to purchase girl's colors so they dont ship as shown, but amazon is so great they gave me a credit and I still kept the bottles."
85505,1,Great product! Baby fits just right with this insert. Great price and speedy service! Thanks again for the great product.
86870,0,"I wanted to love these but I just didn't--but it's completely personal preference. I used Avent bottles in the past (no liners) so I thought I would try something different for my second child because I had friends that just raved about these. Maybe it was just that I was used to the non-liner system from the first go-round or maybe I didn't like the extra step...but after going through the few included liners, I decided it just wasn't going to happen and I went back to Avent. My friends said they liked them because they didn't have to wash them...but you have to wash the nipples and rings anyway, so what's the big deal about washing the bottle, too? So, the bottles are perfectly fine...I just ended up preferring another style."
157623,2,"I am not happy with these cups as every time my son, who is 12 months, gets the lid to come off. Will be getting new ones."
87791,2,"I guess some babies love this mat, but mine could not have cared less. The toys that hung from it did not interest them. I hung the Tiny Love Trio of toys from it, too, but they were bored by all of it. I'm glad it was a gift and that I did not pay for it myself, because I got very little use out of it."
94252,1,"I bought this to take with us on our trip. My son loves his Jumperoo, but too big to take with us. So I tried it out for the first time today and he had huge smiles the whole time, he was up and down SO high, he likes it better than the jumperoo! He also loves to spin around in it. He couldn't get enough. But best on an empty stomach-- he spit up 3 times :). What a great price too!!"
23418,2,"I have had to replace the batteries several times on this unit and I've only had it for a few months. Last week I just replaced them again with brand new Energizer Max batteries ([...]), and they lasted two days. Yes, I said two days!! Who can afford [...] bucks every two days to maintain a [...] dollar unit? I think I'll have to live with a little stink, 'cause the cost stinks alot worse. Thanks for flushing my money down the toilet, The First Years!"
170723,2,I received this sheet and was immediately disappointed. The quality is very cheap and it wasn't a perfect fit. I am surprised that this is made by Graco - usually their products are good. I would not recommend buying this. I would buy a regular crib sheet instead.
143033,0,My husband and I have been pretty happy with this product. It's true that the lid breaks within the first week no matter how delicately you open it and the opening is too large so it doesn't tear off one wipe at a time. That is why I am rating it with 3 stars. It serves it's pupose though. You get nice warm moist wipes each time. We haven't ever had them dry out or brown on us and our baby likes the warm wipes. Wipes cool so easily once they hit the air it almost seems pointless but we like it for using warm wipes on her face and hands too. It would be a great product if the two major problems were fixed. We just open the lid each time we need to get a wipe out.
168362,1,I recently subscribed to Amazon Mom to have these diapers regularly delivered. I have been very pleased with the quality and have had no surprise leaks. The price through AmazonMom is fantastic and saves me the trouble of hauling 2 little ones out at the last minute in winter to pick up diapers.My only complaint is a slight chemical smell. It's not enough to deter me from using them but it is enough that I notice it each time I'm changing my daughter. We have tried several brands and use Target brand for our older daughter (20 months) but don't like the quality of the generic brand for our littler (4 month old) daughter and you can't beat the convenience of having them regularly show up at your door step. We will definitely stick with Pampers Swaddlers for a while.
56980,1,"Actually my daughter loves it. It does exactly what is needed, where it is needed. Easily keeps my granddaughter safely out of harm's way."
75540,0,"We decided to purchase this along with the Aspen 5 drawer chest to match our Storkcraft crib. At a quick glance, the pieces are beautiful; however, I caution you get what you pay for. I think for the price, the quality is pretty good. But if you are looking for good sturdy pieces I may suggest looking elsewhere. The assembly was not all that difficult, but you can tell the quality of the products used is not there. At least four of the knobs for the drawers came with holes drilled too large for the screws to attach them to the drawers. Our one dresser came damaged, but Storkcraft's customer service was excellent and had replacement parts shipped free of charge to our house in about a week! I think that is wonderful considering we are on the east coast and they are located on the west coast! All in all, these will get the job done and are nice looking for the price we paid. However, I do look to be buying another set of dressers in about 5 years depending on how rough the kid is with them."
45610,0,"I was looking for something that would help my son to enjoy tummy time and encourage him learn to crawl. Unfortunately, this didn't do the trick.The music feature is fairly nice, with 2 settings and touch sensitivity, so the baby can activate it if he pushes the right area. There is also a little squeeky toy in the mat that the baby can find, if he's so inclined. The toys are cute, but they never really captured his attention.The mirror feature was a big selling point for me, as children his age are supposed to enjoy seeing their own reflection, but again, my son just wasn't interested.The bottom line is: He got bored very quickly when I put him down on this mat. It was alot of money to spend on something we never use."
65471,0,"I've tried a few different creams now. This one is just ok. Not fantastic. It is kind of thin and a little runny compared to the other's I've tried. It did clear up my son's rash, but I like buttpaste better and am currently using Weleda Baby Calendula Diaper Care Cream, which I love."
76715,1,Bought as a baby shower gift and it was a hit! No one had ever seen it before so everyone enjoyed it and got a good laugh out of it. The mom loved it!
106049,0,"The first 6 months I had the diaper champ I thought it was fabulous! A breeze to use, the older kids can flip the lid, only uses regular trash bags. I had no issues with it at all. Well, as you more experienced parents know, the REAL test is the more ""big kid"" diapers that are a result of a child eating all kinds of table foods!Without being too gross, I have to say that the odor is absolutely unbearable. Its just as bad as all the rest including the Diaper Genie, the Fisher Price diaper pail and for the awful stench in the baby's room, I might as well be throwing the dirty diapers in a regular old trash can.This works fine for most diapers. Take your toxic ones to an outside trash bin."
129111,1,"I love my icoo targo stroller except for one thing: the sunshade is too short. So I bought this sunshade, as it's the only one that's custom made for the rock star baby edition of the icoo targo (don't worry, it fits the regular targo too). This was a great purchase. It's practical, durable, and pretty. The baby can see out and you can see in when you're pushing the stroller. It's breezy so baby can still enjoy the fresh outdoor air, but the mesh is tight enough to keep out small gnats. Raindrops flow right off the material, and best of all, it provides UV-50 protection. If it's hot outdoors, our baby is kept at a nice moderate temp inside. The entire contraption folds nicely & easily fits into the targo's zippered pocket. The only downside is that if you like inserting the stroller seat facing you, the velcro snaps do not have a place to latch onto. However, it's not a big deal for me as the the entire shade hangs nicely with and without the snaps. Our baby likes to open the sides of his personal privacy shield (people standing about 5 ft out can't see your baby) and peek out occasionally. I docked one star bc 1) when it first arrived, there was a factory chemical smell that went away after we aired out the shield for 1wk outdoors and 2) it's pricey compared to the other generic sunshades that are available. Note: I have never tried this with the bassinet, so cannot comment on the bassinet fit. Also note, as far as I know, after doing extensive research, this is the only available sunshade that is custom made for the icoo targo strollers. Luckily, it's a pretty decent, good-looking shade."
44541,1,We use this for our little son & they're a great fit- he grew into them from 7lbs.
175743,0,"The other reviews on this amazon site must refer to another model, because what we received has the swaddles totally integrated into the sleep sac / cannot be removed. This said, it's a great swaddle. Velcro is very sturdy and baby won't break free, though sometimes teh swaddle portion kikes up over her head/mouth area. The length is great as our 2 mo old kid is 99th percentile and still fits in it (she does not fit in the cotton sleep sacs of same size/same brand - go figure). The only issue is that the three layers of fleece on top when swaddled are way too hot even for New England winter. As such we really would only use this if our heating broke for whatever reason..."
34756,1,"When I first started researching car seats, a friend told me this was the only way to go. After reading these reviews, I was a little skeptical, but we decided to give the Alpha Omega a try. I'm so glad we did! This car seat is so comfortable for my daughter. She loves it! It might not have been the easiest to install, but show me a carseat that is!!! I think the biggest problem is that people are not patient. Take your time at installing and fitting the harness to your child and you will love it!!! As far as the straps twisting... again, show me a carseat where the straps don't twist every now and then. The most important thing is that my child is safe, comfortable, and happy in her Alpha Omega!"
118517,2,The grate is now made with plastic instead of metal. This makes it very hard to push the food through. Basically it will only work for foods like sweet potatoes and foods that are already very mushy. Even very overcooked peas wouldn't go through the grate. Maybe it would work for canned veggies? Would not recommended...
60610,2,THIS THING IS BIG AND BULKY AND SLIPPERY WHEN WET. BEST ONE IS Summer Infant Mother's Touch Large Comfort Bather
147344,2,Watch out! I paid for a NEW Mobicam from Amazon and received a USED unit. The seal had already been opened on the packaging and the units inside were clearly quite old and used (lots of wear and tear). Be careful about buying online from Amazon!!!!
172173,1,"My husband and I were too nervous to bathe our newborn daughter in the sink and she hates having sponge baths. We used this tub with the sling in it for the first time last night (the night it arrived in the mail!) and she loved it. She relaxed in the sling like it was a hammock. Make sure you adjust the sling before you put baby in it though. We put her in and water got in her ears because it was adjusted a bit low in the water. Also, it could be a drowning hazard. Watch your baby! I am looking forward to bath time now. This tub makes it a whole lot easier and fun"
129457,0,"Can't give it any high rating b/c product wasn't for my own use, I don't like to leave ratings for products that I don't personally use, but the person that requested it didn't give me any negative feed back so this product apparently met their needs."
95673,0,"Doesn't fit as many stuffed animals as the pic appears. Can't put ant of our daughters big stuffed animals n it, just the medium and little sized ones."
146931,0,"I got this mat because mainly because it was the best looking one I could find. Many cheaper mats offer the same padding, but I spent more primarily for the look of this mat. However, we've had it now for only about 6 months and it is already looking terrible. We have it in a room with a lot of windows (but live in a very cloudy area, so it is not in full sun often) and within about 4 months, the yellow faded and is now about the same color as the ivory tiles now. I know I should expect some sun damage, but that much that fast?! Very disappointing. Other than that, it's been fine. Creates a safe space for my baby boy to play. We had no issues with smell that the others mentioned and I like that it's BPA, etc., free. However, like I said, the main reason we shelled out more for this specific mat was for the aesthetic, which is basically down the tubes now."
160504,1,"We decided to purchase this product because my daughter though her stand alone potty was a play toy. We specifically picked this design because it was Dora. It fits great and she loves it. The only thing I do not like is the lip attached to the front, I am assuming it is there so the pee does not go out, but it kind of gets in her way when she is trying to sit down."
6155,1,"I bought this seat for my 7 month old, and she immediatly loved it. I had origanlly bought the marathon thinking it would be great for her to grow into, but even with our explorer it was just to big and bulky. This seat was perfect! I now have a 2004 accord which is equiped with the latch system, installing this seat was a breeze using the latch. Just make sure to carefully read the owners manual it can be a little confusing. My daughter is now one and facing forward, this seat doesn't budge and inch, although when it was rear facing I diden't feel that it was as secure as it should be, I guess because there was nothing holding onto the back. Anyhow I highly recommend this seat to anyone willing to pay a little extra for peace of mind, easy installation, and of course the most important thing the safety of your child. It is of course a little pricey but with all the research I did this was by far the best seat.."
173148,1,"good value for the price, used in our 2007 jetta to save the seats. works great and car seat does not slip."
79549,1,"We decided to purchase this wagon after considering all the available two-child transportation systems. Our 3.5-year-old, and shortly thereafter of course her 18-month-old sister, had begun to refuse to get in our double stroller. We live in the city, and walk everywhere, so it was becoming difficult to get around (I would end up having to carry one or both of the girls and push the stroller!). This wagon has fit our needs very well, with just a few cons.Pros: (1) Kids love facing each other and its set-up as a wagon is definitely more appealing to them than the traditional stroller design. We facilitated this by building it up as a ""wagon"" and always referring to it as such. (2) It folds very quickly and compactly, which is great for day care stroller parking area, public transportation, and the car. It's a little awkward to carry (especially if you are also carrying a child) but definitely manageable for short distances. (3) The seats are wide and roomy so comfortable for the girls, and they are low enough so that my older daughter can easily climb in and out as she wants. (4) The wagon maneuvers forward and in a circle very smoothly...which is a necessity because it doesn't back-up very well. (5) Last but not least, it looks unique and sporty...We have also been stopped by many people (24 over one weekend on the boardwalk in Ocean City NJ!!) asking us about it. Even passersby (especially men!) who don't stop us will comment on what a ""great"" or ""cool"" stroller it is, and wonder why you don't see it more often. So many people have asked us about it that I am considering keeping information sheets on me to hand out ;) It seems to me that Fisher Price should market this more, because people do seem very interested in it.Cons: (1) As others have noted, the seats don't recline and are quite upright, so when my 18-month-old falls asleep, her head has to tilt awkwardly to the side...but I did know this when purchasing it. (2) Pulling the wagon does take some getting used to, but I have taken some rather long walks, even uphill with no problem. I do wonder why they couldn't make a version that you could push like a stroller, because it seems like this option would appeal to even more people (perhaps more the adults than the kids). (3) The lack of storage was potentially an issue, so from Fisher Price website, I purchased the attaching Active Gear backpack (which holds an amazing amount of stuff) and the matching cooler pack (which carries lunch for 2 kids well). Note that the points of attachment for the bags are only on the back of the rear seat, not both seats (as I had seen in the product description somewhere). However, the strap for the cooler pack does fit over the back of the other seat, so both bags can be carried together. (4) I love that it has detachable canopies, which do provide some shade from sun, but these tend to detach rather too easily, and they are a little flimsy....often now we will simply leave them off unless we will be out in the mid-day sun. (5) The only relatively major complaint I have is that, as noted above, it does not back-up very well (the wheels seem to awkwardly turn inward when you try to back-up), so I have gotten into some tight spots (e.g., elevators) that require some maneuvering to get out of....the maneuvering is much easier if I ask my older daughter to temporarily get out of the wagon, but of course this is not always convenient. Also, the wheels do extend the width to somewhat wider than a single stroller, but in most doorways and shopping aisles this has not been a major problem (though sometimes when making a turn, the wheel will get stuck on something in the turn). This also just takes some getting used to.In sum, I think this wagon was the best option for us, and despite some minor design issues that could be improved, it's working out great!!"
181591,0,"This swaddle is so-so. We have twins and both are able to get loose when they are determind which renders it useless for the purpose.They are now 2 months old but were 6 weeks early at around 5lbs - it was very useful for the first month.I have tried 2 other swaddle blankets and I recommend the ""amazing miracle blanket"" - especially for babies 7lb and more.Unlike this blanket the AMB has no velcro and relies on the baby's weight to keep secure. This translates to a much more robust solution."
95164,2,"What a huge waste of money. I have a Pump in Style Advanced which I love. But I leave it at work and one day, I was staying home sick when I realized that my baby was at daycare and my pump was at work and I was in trouble. So, I went out and dropped $150 on the Medela Swing. I was pleased with my purchase since I liked my pump in style so much and I thought this would be fine for very occasional use. First of all, the swing has increadibly weak suction. It took me over 30 minutes on each side just to get my breasts down to a comfortable level, not even to empty them completely! I shudder to think what this one sick day of pumping will do to my supply for the next few days. Plus, the little white flange doesn't open and close with each pump like it's supposed to. As a result, your milk gets trapped in the little yellow flap and then flows up into the tubing! If you are buying a breast pump, please please please shell out the extra money for the Pump In Style."
57521,1,"this is adorable and so worth the money. totally outdo's any of the play mats you can find in the stores. my baby is only 2 months old and is already intrigued by the frog and butterfly and her first coo's were at the frog, I even found her holding his hand. I know once she gets a little older this will be even greater. most playmats just have a patterned mat that the baby can lay on, but this is great b/c it has sides and the objects on it are all 3D. love love love it"
181196,1,My sophia loves her tummy time mat! It really is great and has lots of neat things to look at. She will play up to an hour on it which is great for me!!
131327,1,"I'm not using these for potty training - just using them as a diaper for my one year-old - they are all I use during the day. My husband thinks they are so much easier to get on and off than regular tab style diapers. I use Cruisers at night, though, b/c the few times we have tried First Steps at night, we have had a very wet baby and bed!"
165141,1,This product is perfect fit & does not leak. my daughter does a good job on testing the product &this item Pampers passes with flying colors. it is good value to buy from Amazon for great service.
77955,1,"I purchased the Eddie Bauer Designer Seat along with the stroller for my first granddaugher. We have been totally satified with the performance and durability of the seat. Cleans easily, five point harness is wonderful-makes us feel like we are giving her the best protection. The base with one hand snap in feature has been a life saver for my daugher since she is expecting her second child soon, does not require additional time to secure. I highly recommend this product."
67720,0,"not as big as i thought, couldnt find any sheets that would fit the bed. with toddlers in the home it was hard keeping the items on its shelves from staying off the floor. would have liked some types of cabinets or something to keep little hands off. overall worked well and did its purpose for ages newborn to 15months."
42464,1,"I LOVE this wrap! I have the Maya sling and the Ergo carrier and by far the moby wrap is my favorite! It is so comfortable and my 9 week old is so snug in it! I have been using it since he was 2 weeks and it's been a life saver. I mainly use it around the house, it is so long it is difficult to put on out in public places without it dragging on the ground. Overall it is fabulous and I highly recommend it!"
167338,1,"It's been 3yras since iv bought a carseat, but after a lot of research I decided to buy this one for my 10 month old. It is extremely soft, and very sturdy. When I received it, I was a bit overwhelmed on how to install it because it looks like a different installation process. Thank goodness the instruction are attached to the carseat. Took about 5 min for me to install, and boy..is it secure. It doesn't move an inch. My daughter seems to love it too. She can peek her lil head up and see around now, rather then her infant car seat. I would def recommend."
121178,1,"I bought this directly from the Fisher Price website for I believe the $35- $40 range on sale. I like it just fine. It fits easily in my bathroom and I can put the baby in it while I take a shower. She can get by 15 minutes with no vibration or music until she gets bored. Then she will get by with 15 minutes of vibration and music before she gets bored again. By that time, I am showered and dressed. I wouldn't pay the regular price for it though."
162529,1,"My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born. We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old. I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily. It does leak at the hinges. My daughter is very comfortable in it. Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm. It does fit in the kitchen sink though. I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub. It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher. She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!"
115988,1,"THE BEST & my new gift for all new moms""I loved this cream! It has a very nice sweet smell that makes you think of ""baby smell"", much more than the medicinal smell of lanolin creams. It was much more moisturizing and soothing than lanolin could ever be! It was not sticky but more the consistency of lotion that was less painful to put on than lanolin. Lanolin comes off of sheeps' skin and is basically ""sheep sweat"". It's in most lotions and chapsticks on the market in the U.S. and is the #1 allergen according to dermatologists.""-mother who majored in Biologicial Science and Anatomy"
111575,1,I ordered this product after reading the positive reviews willing to give it a try. I am solely breastfeeding my newborn but needed to start pumping to prepare for returning back to work. I had the medela double electric pump but the suction was not strong enough for me to get more than a drop. Not sure if there was something wrong with it but on the first try with this manual pump I got 3 oz of milk. Yes my hand got a little tired the first couple of times but nothing horrible. It is not to time consuming 10-15 min per breast for me. I've been using it only at home but will take it to work with me when I return in 2 weeks to pump from work. Overall Great and I am so glad I ordered it!!!
52726,1,"This chair was WONDERFUL when our baby was a newborn, it was about the only place he'd sleep! But by the time he was 2 months old and looking to explore things, he became bored quickly. We added a toy bar and he was okay, but prefers the bouncer chair now. It's perfect for newborns to sleep cozily. I recommend this for all moms!!! We have bought 3 people these as gifts and all 3 also love the chair. The bouncers sit the babies too upright and this has just been perfect! Our chair has also gotten a lot of use, we have borrowed it to my sister-in-law and after that one of our friends is going to use it!!!"
80685,1,These Pamper pull-ups are constructed well and are strong enough to handle mistakes. There were a few pullups in the box that had their sides torn which was bothersome but overall they did there job well.
87320,1,"I find these to be quite convenient for giving my baby breastmilk from the bottle. With the Playtex One-Step storage system, I pump directly into the liner and stick it in the fridge, and then I can pop it in a nurser when it's time to feed. My husband and other caregivers are quite glad at the ease of putting it all together when they're juggling a crying baby.As advice to others, I wonder whether the original nurser gift set might be better, because it comes with multiple different kinds of nipples, whereas this set only comes with the silicone slow flow. We've lucked out, in that my baby seems happy with it and switches easily from breast to bottle and vice versa; however, it might have been handy to be able to try different kinds to see which the babe likes best. The shells in this set are more modern looking, but I can't see how that matters. I'm pretty sure the pieces for both are interchangeable. Nice that the silicone nipples in this set (and all the other pieces; latex nipples are less hardy) are dishwasher safe, and can be repeatedly boiled for sterilization if desired.The short shells in this set are fine, and it's easier to reach in the bottom to squish the liner with your fingers (to help it collapse; the drop-in liners are relatively more shape-holding than regular liners, so they can suck in air), but usually my baby has more than 4 oz at a sitting; in the 8oz size shell, the burper is nice (it's hard to reach in when the liner is less full), but it doesn't squish the liner all the way, so we end up taking off the shell and using our fingers for the last 2 oz or so. I have never had any problem with leaking.I like the disposable bit of this system, since the nipples, collars, and lids take up enough space and cleaning effort without having a bunch of bottles around as well. Liners are pricy if you use a lot (about $5 for 50 at Walgreens), but since we only use a bottle a day, it doesn't seem like much. They also freeze easily. This set came with one adapter for a breast pump (I use an Ameda Purely Yours, and they fit together perfectly), and the One-Step comes with another, so I can use the double pumping without buying any other pieces. Overall, I'm very happy with this set."
48729,1,"I bought this for our new pekeapoo, who doesn't know her boundaries yet. It is a great play yard. It not only makes the shape shown, but you can pretty much conform it to the shape of the area you are putting it in. It seems very sturdy, but may get pushed around with a bigger dog/children. The height is great. The only flaw with it would be it's look. It kinda reminds me of a gray milk crate. The design could be a little more for interior use. Other than that, great product for the money!"
177018,1,"Our baby loves this player (especially the rain sound). You can definitely get by without it, but we found this portable player to be quite convenient. We took it with us whenever we went to other people's houses or restaurants to help our baby go to sleep more easily in a different environment. It does eat up batteries terribly, but we use rechargeable ones that make it much more cost efficient (recommend NiMH rechargables instead of NiCad, because NiMH have more power, can be recharged over 1000 times, and [most importantly] have absolutely no battery &quot;memory&quot; like NiCad's do (which prevents NiCad's from being fully recharged))."
135267,1,It was a good deal with the covering with it and it was nice and plump. Yes will be telling friends and family. The price was good for Ive paid more for them before.
62330,1,"We purchased 2 ""Bundle Me"" products but when the box arrived in the mail, they had sent only one product. I contacted Amazon and they were apologetic and without asking any additional questions they sent me the 2nd product. However, this required us to wait an additional week for the product to arrive in the mail. I thought that Amazon should have at least made good on their mistake by sending the 2nd product via an express shipping method, but they did not. As for the Bundle Me product iteself, our twins enjoy it and it helps keep them nice and warm as we enter the colder weather."
116962,0,"I really like the design of this tub, with the molded seating areas, which our current baby tub does not have. Unfortunately, our 95th percentile in height daughter is too long when she's seated in it - her feet are already hitting the baby seating area, so back it goes. We've since gotten a EuroBath, and she has room to grow in that one."
58793,1,"I have used it for almost 4 months. I use Avent bottles and this saves time and hassle to sterilize them.Now, I don't use it, my baby is 8 months old, but for the first 4 months of his life, and my new motherhood, it sure was a help!!!"
21938,0,"While you might save money buying this online, the photos do not really let you see the 'grain' of the wood. I purchased this in 'espresso' which to mean means a DARK wood, and this wood is extremely grainy...if you, like me, do not like grained wood than skip this crib and choose another where you can get it in a darker/more solid color. Or definitely view it in person first!"
158948,1,"These bottles saved my son's tummy. He wore a Pavlic Harness for the first 2 months of his life so he was unable to move and stretch out his legs enough to allow his bowels to function properly. After screaming for 2 weeks straight we finally tried these bottles and found the solution to his discomfort. We kept using these bottles all the way up until he was 15 months old and weened from the bottle entirely. They did cost more than the other bottles, but for us it was well worth it. There was never a bubble in the nipple and the seals stayed tight. I gave these 4 stars only because we don't own a dishwasher so the washing was hard to keep up with, having so many parts. If we had a dishwasher it would've been 5 stars, easily. However, I would recommend purchasing a larger quantity of bottles so washing does not become an issue."
118608,1,"This is what I expected, except I thought the piece that the food goes through should have been metal, and it was plastic. I don't know how the plastic will hold up grinding things like meat. Time will tell. (the picture shows metal, but it was plastic.)"
41191,1,My husband and I have tried all kinds of diapers and I have to say that in general Pampers have just WORKED for us. I mean I have very little complaint with their diapers (with the exception of their newborn diapers which didn't work with either our skinny son or chubby daughter.)But about the Cruisers. Absolutely first rate absorbency. We used these at night with both children until they turned three and had only one leak in all that time (and I think that was an 'installment' problem dad had--LOL).[At three we switched over to Pamper's Goodnites. It was just easier to get the kid's into them and the waistband is more comfortable.]Five Stars. Best diaper on the market from our experience.
102460,0,"I loved the fact it attached so easily and perfectly to our crib (Munire urban). Also like the way it looks. The music is pretty terrible though. At least you can turn it down though. My son does love to watch the leaves though, so I do not regret buying it."
26367,1,This is a great swing! Our baby loves it! The seat reclines in many positions so we were able to put him in it the first couple weeks after birth. Our first son had a swing with batteries and we ran through so many D batteries. This one you just plug in and let him swing away!! The music that is plays is also very soothing. Great swing. Love it!!!
105621,0,"Our experiences with the Champ have been mixed. Not only have diapers gotten stuck in the cylinder and been torn in the &quot;dropping&quot; process, but they also get stuck when the champ is moderately full. The odor does leak quite often when in a small space (the closet) or even when in the bedroom. Not to mention the pure stench when changing bags. It's enough to knock out a postpartum mom with strong &quot;smell indicators&quot; still working.The convenience of using regular garbage bags is definitley the biggest plus in this contraption."
23213,0,The organizer seems to hold its purpose which for me was to hold all of my frozen milk it one compartment (without being all over the freezer). However i did not think it held the bags upright very well. I had to just throw them in the case however they would fit.
114664,1,"The Fisher-Price Booster Seat is exactly what I needed. It is very easy to strap onto my chairs, the grandkids are secure, and it is very easy to clean and store! You can use the tray or slide up to the dinner table depending on the age of the child, or depending on whether the family is eating or you're just giving the child a snack. I'm very happy with this purchase."
28624,2,"I got the package in a somewhat beat up condition with a big tear on one of the edges with a wood part exposed. Thankfully there wasn't a mark on the wood so I was relieved. I put the chair together in minutes and was pretty happy. I was even happier that the ottoman didn't have to be built at all. That is, until I started pulling apart the plastic covering the cushion. As I was removing the plastic from underneath of the cushion, I noticed a crack that ran edge-to edge for the support part of the ottoman cushion. Basically, if it was ever sat on, it would just break in half. Also, two of the legs supports were cracked pretty badly. I hated to have to go through the trouble of disassembling it to return it, but there was no other choice. Stinks pretty bad."
3606,1,"good for the price, nice color, , big and tall seat, fast and free shipping."
159279,1,"This bouncy seat is worth every cent you will spend on it. As a new mom of a colicky newborn, this seat was our saving grace. The vibrations and wave sounds soothed him as a newborn and now he loves the music and watching the bubbles and star spin. He hasn't gone a day without sitting in it since we brought him home from the hospital and I don't see him outgrowing it anytime soon (he's five and a 1/2 months old) It is a definate must have for new moms of colicky babies. I love it, he loves it and if it ever breaks, we will gladly spend the money to buy another one to replace it! FIVE BIG STARS, thank you Fisher Price!"
148504,1,"This pillow works very well but takes up half of the space on a king size bed. Technically the wife owns that half, so, no biggie. :DMight be too big for a queen size bed.Also, would have preferred an easy storeaway bag or something, because you cannot just leave it lying on the bed and its too bulky to store in a closet. Hence the 4 stars."
143546,1,Straight review. I like it. the color is too dark though. but I can take it.
79332,1,"I received this set at a baby shower back in 2005. It has held up really well. My only advice: with a retail price of $232.00 and even an Amazon price of $152, it's still too steep. I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever ""made"" the bed. Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees. The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib.I do especially love the lamp, switchplate, mobile and 5-pc wall hanging from this collection. You could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone."
182808,1,"I did some research before buying this carseat and found that it was just as good as some carseats that cost $100 more! One of the best features is that the car seat is so light! My daughter loves her car seat, she's nine months old and a big girl, but still has plenty of room to grow. And the best feature of all is the price!!! I don't know why anyone would spend more on another car seat!The only thing I would change is to add a cup holder or something to it."
27322,0,The stroller is great and does its job but the straps to seatbelt my child in are very tight and I end up not using them at all. I cannot seen to adjust the straos eighter.
38879,1,"We gave our son all his sponge baths on this &quot;pillow&quot;. He seemed quite comfortable on it. We never used it in the tub or sink because I ended up using it so often throughout the day! Our son didn't like sleeping on his back, but when he slept on the SaferBather pillow, he slept alot longer, and everyone was happier! We also used it as a place to set him down in a hurry, and to take pictures! THe nice thing was you could pick up the pillow and him if he fell asleep in the parlor, for instance, and place him in his crib,pillow and all.It didn't come with a removable cover, so I stuck it in a pillow case and pinned it for easy cleaning.Once he was able to arch his back and nearly roll, we stopped letting him sleep on it. And now that our he'too old for sleeping on it (it's flattened out some from the extended use!), I still keep in in the bottom of his oversized bassinet, near the changing table, where it's OK that his legs hang over the end of the pillow. It makes a great, comfortable place to set him down after his bath, or when changing outfits. I wish I'd had two of these, one for the bath, too!"
50221,0,"I was so excited to purchase this potty. My son was still using the seat from his baby potty chair and putting it on the big potty (so he didn't fall in.) When I saw this, I thought it would be wonderful because I could get rid of that extra little seat that was probably a germ bank. I think the idea is great if you purchase it while your child is still potty training and doesn't have a preconceived notion of what a potty should feel like. My son used it for a month (I insisted on ""giving it your best shot""), and he was consistant in saying that it hurt is bottom. Sure enough, he would have a pretty red ring when he stood up. My son is slight of build, and is not very heavy. However, he does enjoy a good ""bathroom"" magazine, so he sits for a good 5 minutes. Another thing to consider in my review is that he has always used a padded child's seat. This may have led to a tender bum bum. Who knows, but I will be taking it off, giving it a good home at a friends house, and purchasing another cushy seat to replace the one I threw away."
44767,1,"I bought the Sunshine Kids Radian after doing a lot of reaserch to find a convertible seat that could fit along side two boosters. It's tight, but works like a charm (no need for another mini-van!). The seat couldn't be any sturdier- construction is great & I feel that my baby is safe in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the difficulty with installation."
160995,1,"My wife bought me this bag and I love it. It's great that it doesn't look like most diaper bags. The camo pattern is great. The zippers are strong and well assembled. There is plenty of room for everything you need, but it's not so big that it feels cumbersome. I highly recommend this bag."
18622,2,"Most &quot;joggers&quot; do have stationary front tires and you will have to lift them up a little to turn. The problem I found with the Little Tikes jogger is when you are walking, it pulls to one side and is hard to operate. I was disappointed because I have purchased so many Little Tikes products and have never had a problem with any of them."
73081,1,"I bought the first floppy seat when my son, Gabriel, was just barely sitting up. The infant carrier was bulky and heavy. I found this to be a big help. It's easy to take along because it folds up nicely. It's great because when I put Gabe in the carraige, I don't have to worry about the hard metal or all the germs! It also keeps my hands off the cart so I can get him snacks, hand him his Binky with out worring about washing my hands every 5 seconds. I now have the newer one (blue) with rings on it for Binky clips, toys or anything really. I keep the new one in my car, the older one stays in my husbands car. I also keep at Grammie's house for when Gabe and Grammie go out. This has served as a pillow and a rain shield on many occasions too. I just think this is the most wonderful thing for everyone! Oh and it cleans so easily! Just toss in the washer and dryer and you're all done."
43744,1,"The extension was easy to install with good instructions. I LOVE that I can use this gate in a larger door, because of this extension."
127311,1,Very nice crib with great features. This is the second one we have purchased for our grandchildren and are quite happy with the quality and options. Arrived quickly also
101613,1,"We monitor 2 children. Rather than scan, as some have mentioned, for a while we put both receivers by the bed at night and put one on A and one on B, so we got continuous monitoring of both children.But we do get the POPPING noise! So now I also have a cheap Safety 1st ($16) monitor in the baby's room-it works great...and for my 3 year old, we use this one but if it is popping, I turn it down pretty low because he will yell or come to my room.Love that it recharges! The cheapy I have in the baby's room does not, it has to be plugged in...so if we are watching tv in the den, I use this one to monitor her.So overall I have been satified. I tried many other monitors trying to find 2 that would work together. That was like looking for a needle in a haystack. I did have one Sony 27 channel that I liked, and it worked with our original that we used with our first child, but it often beeped in my room saying it was out of range. So I took it back and got this one.I am having a problem that has just started, the sound shorts out on one of the receivers...if I jiggle the volume dial it comes back but goes out again in the night. I am going to contact the company."
31731,2,"brush actually works great, but i see chunks of sponge coming off almost daily after use. not very well made for durability."
90897,1,I purchased the Economy Pack of Pampers because it was such a great deal. Diapers are essential for babies and can become a big expense for parents. I was able to send several months of diapers to these first time parents. They have been much appreciated.
28721,1,"It is a great price, the cloth is smooth, it is pretty sturdy, although I am 180lbs and I can tell the chair would eventually break if I was not careful when sitting down.All in all, I recommend, but not for heavyweights that like to throw their weight around."
111437,0,"I bought this because I thought it would work well to help hide a rather long cord going to our speaker under the TV. However, there were no prongs on which to wrap the cord, and the covers only slide on, so it was rather difficult to maneuver. However, I had another problem safety area with a large charging box outlet, and this was large enough to hide that completely, so it ended up working well."
183767,1,"I bought this blanket and two other Baby Star blankets for my new grandbabies. These are the most luxurious blankets ever! I took the blankets to someone and had the names embroidered on the satin before giving them as a gift and I can't tell you how everyone at the shower loved the blankets. I recommend these blankets as a high end baby shower gift. Personally, I bought mine on sale on Amazon.com for $17 to $19 each. I am just sorry I didn't buy up the entire stock of the blankets when they were on sale."
11166,1,"I'm a big ""value"" person - I want to get quality for my $! I felt like I got it with this Pack and Play. Our son slept in the bassinet portion until he was around 4 months old (instead of an actual bassinet) and we used the changing table feature instead of getting an actual changing table. The storage area clip on feature was great too in the early, newborn days, for keeping the little things you need on hand. Once our son moved to his crib, we occasionally used it to contain our crawler during the day, but now it's mostly for going to the in-laws.Overall, really like this product.The only cons I can think of is that it is really heavy when closed up - not something you would want to take with you on an airplane trip - it would be a huge pain and expense. The other thing is that it can be tricky to set up/take down, as the collapsible sides don't always click in/out as easily as I would hope. There seems to be an order of tasks that if you follow it will come together much easily. Spend a few minutes with the instructions!"
34050,1,"We bought 2 of these before a trip with my 2 kids. It fit the large car seat for my 4 year old as well as the infant car seat and base just fine. It was much easier to get around with a stroller and luggage. I would recommend getting this one versus the rolling one. There is already enough luggage and the backpack makes it much easier. We had some problems with the zipper breaking on one of them, but amazon replaced it quickly. Make sure that you use these just for the car seat and don't let your husband try to shove in lots of heavy things, it makes them awkward to carry with more than just the car seat. These bags are also great for storing car seats so they don't get dirty or damaged."
177712,0,"This is in response to the person opening a day care and looking for mattress for the porta cribs. I found a mattress store in Des Moine, IOWA called SLEEPLAND USA that will make a mattress in any size you want. I bought a mattress from them for my daughter's cradle and one for her porta crib. I love them, they are each 3&quot; thick, a lot thicker than other mattresses I found. It only takes them one day to custom make your mattress and they are also very reasonable in price."
148733,1,"I purchased this pillow after spending countless nights with body pillows and sleeping pillows surrounding me and my stomach. This pillow accommodates a healthy twin (or more) belly and back. It will even fold enough so you can ""Diva Lounge"" on it, lay inclined on your back to prevent heartburn. I can't say I'd use it as a nursing pillow but I can see this becoming an every day pillow even after pregnancy!"
113025,0,"Purchasing a matching dresser to go with out crib & changing table online proved to be difficult bc there are hardly any that have decent reviews overall. I went ahead and purchased the Storkcraft Aspen 5 drawer Chest in Espresso bc I have the Storkcraft crib in espresso as well and I wanted to ensure that they were a good match.When the box arrived I realized that it was not going to go together quickly as the box was only about 2 feet wide but very long. That meant every single aspect of this dresser had to be assembled. No part of it came preassembled. Several pieces had strange indentions (not through the stain but almost like bruising? very strange and difficult to describe), and in the corners of the top of the dresser the veneer is already starting to chip away from the pressboard. There is very little actual wood (if any?) on the whole piece. The drawer faces and sides of the dresser seem to be real wood but I can't be certain. Some of the pieces don't seem very accurately cut either but with a little tweaking you can make it work.Overall though it is a very nice looking dresser once you get it put together. It isn't necessarily all that difficult but it is very time consuming (about 2+ hours) and overwhelming at first when you start pulling out all of the necessary pieces. Also - the instruction manual has ZERO words; it's all pictures and only a few of the pieces are marked with stickers so it's pretty much a guessing game as to whether or not you have the right piece at any given time. Again though, it isn't as difficult as it seems at first.My review is based on my expectations of the dresser vs. what we received. We would have sent it back due to the imperfections but honestly didn't want to deal with trying to fit that many pieces back into such a tiny box! When comparing this dresser to the Storkcraft crib I was very disappointed in the difference in quality."
147275,1,Perfect to start my newborn in! She sleeps in my room with me and a regular bassinet they grow out of so fast! So this bassinet is bigger so she can stay in longer. They changing table being connected is great to! It would of been too much for me to get up in the middle of the night and go to the baby room across the house to change her. Also I have a 2 year old that rooms right next to the baby room so the crying in the middle of the night would wake her up and that would not be good! Vibration and nature sounds are a plus also! Love the design too!
10790,0,"The bottles are fantastic for storing milk either in the freezer or fridge. It is much easier than struggling with storage bags and you don't have to worry about the bottle breaking and wasting your milk.The reason I give this 3 stars is because the nipples flow too quickly. When inverting the bottle, milk comes out at about 2 drops per second. I thought the nipple design might slow the flow when it was in a mouth so I let my 3 month old son try it. He was choking on the milk and gasping for air because the milk was coming out too fast. Had I not removed the bottle to slow him down frequently, he would have finished 3 ounces in 2 minutes. When I feed him from an Avent bottle with a newborn nipple, 3 ounces normally takes him about 10 minutes to finish, which is almost identical to when he is breastfeeding. I was told by a lactation consultant that any bottle should require the same or more effort than breastfeeding to decrease the chances of your baby becoming a lazy eater and preferring the bottle over breast. Needless to say, I'm keeping the bottles and throwing away the nipples."
33644,1,"We've been using several of these cups for about a year now. Have worn super well and have not had to replace any valves yet unlike some of our Nuk/Gerber cups--which we've had for less time. These playtex cups cost a little more but are definitely longer wearing & the replacement valves are much less in cost than the Nuk ones. Nuk cups are cheaper, but valves are way more $ to replace."
152139,1,"The set itself is super cute. I saw it at Babies R Us for about the same price as here, but was determined to find it cheaper. I did at Sears.com. Now the set I bought is only a 4 piece instead of 6 piece. It includes the bumper, crib dust ruffle, fitted sheet & quilt. It does NOT include the valance or the diaper stacker. I paid $79 plus $5 for shipping and a few dollars for tax. That's a difference of $100, if you really want the valance and/or diaper bag they are sold separately on Amazon, and you will still pay less then the price here. So its a great set, but make sure you shop around!"
175046,1,"We just LOVE our duckie tub! I've been using it since my son was 9 months old (because it's VERY hard to use if baby can't sit up by theirselves yet) I think it's so much safer for your baby to be in this cushioned, air tub than to be against the hard bathtub sides. You also only have to fill up a small area for bath time, and you just pull the plug when your done with it. You really don't have to deflate it...ours stays inflated, in the corner of the bathroom all the time. I also think this is a very durable product. My son has drug his duckie all around my house, and it's held up with no holes for over a year now. I actually even bought a couple more for the grandparents houses, to make bathtime safe and fun for them too!out of all the products that I've purchased for my baby since day 1, this it the one that i recommend the most!! I don't know how we would of done bathtime without it!"
4549,1,"ITEM CAME JUST AS PICTURED, FAST SHIPPING AND GREAT QUALITY! LOOKS GREAT ON MY DAUGHTER'S DOOR...WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING TO FIND A GREAT QUALITY LETTERS FOR A GREAT PRICE!"
22046,2,"I usually don't write reviews, but I am compelled to voice my opinion on this particular product. I usually sing the praises of Medela products. However, these pump and save bags are terrible!!!! I have an entire freezer full of stored milk; all of which are sealed in these bags. Now that I am back to work, I have had to defrost several bags at a time...daily. Without question, there is ALWAYS 1 bag that is leaking. The leaks are usually not from the zip top, rather, it has burst along one of the the seams. I only fill the bags with 2-4 ounces, allowing for adequate expansion when the milk freezes; trying to ensure the best I can that the bags won't burst open...and still I am finding leaks.For all of you breastfeeding moms, we all know that breast milk is ""liquid gold"" and we have to work SO HARD to produce it. It pains me to see even an ounce of milk wasted in such a manner. Don't waste your money on this!!!!"
162325,1,"Daughter was very pleased when she received it unexpectedly, after her good news! She's very picky also...just loved the quality and organizational value of the set! Very nicely packaged. Would highly recommend."
143718,1,"This is a must-have in our family! I didn't know that I would need it and so I didn't get one until after baby arrived, and I'm so glad I did. We use it everyday, and it's so easy to take on and off. Baby stays warm and you don't have to worry about a flap being over her face or having to use a blanket that will just fly off in the wind. Great value!"
123798,2,"I bought this manual pump w/o doing any research on it and what a terrible mistake! Compare to the Medela Harmony & Avent ISIS I got later, it is a absolute joke - I couldn't get a drop of breast milk out and it hurts like crazy.If you need a manual pump, do yourself a favor and avoid this one. You cannot go wrong w/ either the Medela or Avent one though (Medela Harmony slightly better IMO since it is BPA-free)."
57925,1,"This thing is great!!! It has an automatic shut off button when the bottle is warm, so no bottle goes too long and risks burning the baby, it has a night light so it's easy to find in the dark during those late night feedings, the water is easy as heck to measure out, it has an ""on"" button that illuminates when on...then shuts off when bottle is warm...so no need to unplug and re-plug (great for when it's 3am and you can't remember to unplug it!)It holds Avent bottles, curved bottles, and regular bottles...who can ask for more!!I did alot of research, and there wasn't much information on this particular product, but every review I read about other warmers just didn't sound ""intriguing"" enough for me to purchase....so I took a chance on the express bottle warmer and boy am I glad I did!!!"
131343,0,Used it to protect my new car. It works okay. Interfering with the seatbell bucket a bit.
85401,0,"For starters, if you have a queen size bed, this takes up a little over half the bed (sorry for your partner, but you're pregnant so who cares?). Yes it is comfy and supportive, but being surrounded by all that pillow is HOT!!!!! And my baby was due in February, so the hardest part of my pregnancy was when it was the coldest. Consider that when purchasing this pillow, because I did not. Also trying to roll over onto your other side while 9 months pregnant can get complicated when you are all tangled up in this thing. BUT unlike the ""L"" shaped pillows, this ""U"" shaped pillow did offer back support."
91536,1,there was static when I first turned it on... but i switched it to channel B and the problem was solved!!! and I dont have to have it on very high to hear my little preemie's soft cries... it works well for us.
35946,2,"I just bought this today, granted for my older son so it may be great with newborns, but I have a 13 mo old (he is really little) and isn't walking yet and loves to be held so I thought this might make it easier to carry him and it holds up to 35lbs. Well he wasn't comfortable, it took me watching the dvd a few times to get it on correctly and its hard to smooth out the material like it shows in the pic. Its just not comfortable for bigger kids like it claims. I will be returning mine first thing tomorrow and with the next baby I will be ordering a sling from another company when we have our next baby, which we will be doing AP (attatchemt parenting) with, I was hoping this one would be better and I could use it but no"
117847,1,"I bought this bench/toy chest for my granddaughter. (I don't know how to rate ""educational value"" for a piece of furniture.) Her mother put it together (I just held the parts steady) in about half an hour: directions were clear and easy. It seems durable and sturdy. It has a little drawer (handy for small parts) and holds a pretty extensive doll collection. It is appropriately sized for a 4 year old (and probably would be fine from birth to maybe 6 years old). The decoration is lovely, with muted pinks and lavender, and fits a little girl's room. I'm only sorry I did not buy it when she was younger."
53739,1,We got this bed rail for our son and it was the longest one we could find. The length is great for little ones going into a big kid's bed. It is added safety and an extra peace of mind for us parents. Would definitly recommend this product!! The only thing I would have liked is if it was just alittle taller.
40420,1,"In my opinion these are the best diapers out there. They are a bit overpriced, but the material is soft and breathable, and I think the shape is more comfortable for our baby."
81387,1,The stroller is difficult to collapse. I also don't like how the tray has to clip on and off. I do like the weight of the stroller and I like the covering and basket on the bottom.
121039,2,"I started out diapering my son with Kushies Ultra AIOs when he was about three weeks old. I didn't like them because:1. They took EONS to dry.2. They leaked out of the legs. My son has fat little thighs and they still gaped.3. My son got horrible diaper rash from the cold, clammy wet cotton being up against his bum.The only thing I like about Kushies is that they are easily accessible to people who might be interested in cloth diapering but really have no idea where to start.Long story short, I ebayed them and bought Fuzzi Bunz. We are both so much happier! Fuzzi Bunz are more adjustable, not much more expensive, and dry in just a few hours of hanging indoors. And the pesky diaper rash went away with the Kushies!"
29198,0,This step is well constructed and safe but not very high. My 2 year old still can't reach the sink or countertop with it. About all it's good for right now is reaching the light switches which provides endless entertainment. I think it would be best for an older child that just needs a little boost.
19750,1,I got this at my bridal shower and just bought it for a family member's shower gift. It is wonderful especially if you live in a home where your bedrooms are upstairs and your kitchen is downstairs. It doesn't make bottles or jars really hot. It makes them room temperature which is perfect!
83137,2,"Received as gift, taking it back ASAP! My daughter screamed her head off every time I attempted to ""wear her"". She was literally folded in half! Also, only if you are in your senior years and your [chest] have reached your knees, will this carried work for breastfeeding!Also, for people purchasing gifts for new mothers, there is a reason we spend time registering for gifts. We spend lots of time researching the best products, so why not purchase what we register for, not what you think is a better product. The first few weeks are hard enough without having to make unnecessary returns. (This product was not the carrier I registered for...was told I picked out the wrong carrier...don't think so)"
1727,1,"Pampers Baby Dry diapers are fantastic. There are no leaks, and they fit our baby girl great. We also tried Huggies, which were awful. Huggies actually broke down and left polymer beads all over our babys bottom. We were very unhappy with that. So we have gone to exculsively using Pampers Baby dry diapers. No problems at all."
116482,1,I bought this as a gift for a baby shower. Was a little worried about the stitching not being pink but on the red side but when I received the bag it was hot pink and so adorable! I love it. The zebra print looks fuzzy like a zebra then has the laminated material over it.
107595,2,"These won't stay up for nothing!!The suction cups are worthless and aren't even suction cups honestly!!!!But.......I do like the design and size and whatnot of these so I might keep these and just go buy some kickass suction cups and replace the P.O.S. ones on these shades.But other than that , these are worthless!!!!"
101404,1,"My daughter has so many different Barbie sets that it was hard to keep track of what went with what. So we bought one of these and some white screw in metal hooks at the hardware store. Then I went to work, I hung this sideways on the wall with the hooks. Then I took all of the Barbies and organized them into big zipper Ziplock baggies, then just clipped the baggies onto the organizer. It worked so good, she can take one baggie down at a time and put them back just as easy:) It looks good too!"
77282,0,"We bought this swing for our new baby. It was a great swing at first, with the neat starlight show, rotating mobile, variable swing positions, and decent music system (well, it's not going to win awards, but better than most toys). All-in-all we've been delighted with it, except that the mobile & lights failed after only 3 weeks of using the swing. Nothing abusive was done to the swing. Annoyingly, we had bought it a little before the baby was born, and the warrantee was expired. My wife has found numerous reviews online that reflect our experience.In short, it appears to be a great product that's designed to self-destruct. I suppose this makes sense from a business perspective. This has a pretty limited useful lifespan for a single baby, and it would be easy for a dozen or so durable swings to serve an entire community."
100803,1,"I notice so many people complain the shipping problems, I just want to tell my experience, I ordered it on 22,Oct,2004, and received on 27,Oct,2004. What a fast shipping!!!"
87984,1,"This is such a great item for babies. The colors are perfect for their developing little eyes. My 3 month old is really amused at the little mirror that hangs down, she sees herselfand laughs. It folds up easy for travel and is sturdy enough so you don't worry about it toppling down like some other brands.5***** for this great gym!"
80310,2,I bought this mattress for a mini crib and it ripped at the seam the first day. It isn't very firm and it is very thin. It is a poor quality product that isn't worth the money.
76054,2,The product description claims that each cube in these trays holds one ounce of baby food or breast milk. That is simply not true. Each cube holds one half of an ounce (1 Tablespoon) not an ounce (2 Tablespoons).
155696,1,"The package came on time and in new condition, everything the seller said it would be. Just beware that colors really vary. We order two packs and neither were, to my taste, cute. However, the baby doesn't care :)"
22544,0,"I purchased this for a new granddaughter's visit.....subsequent visits as she grows and other grand children.I also purchased the sheets Amazon suggested. They don't fit and will go back...which begs the question, why did Amazon recommend them?I looked in vain for a mattress to fit this but could never find mattress dimensions. Once I received the Pack & Play the instruction manual states use no mattresses.....no loose sheeting, etc. Again I wonder why Amazon suggested a fitted sheet with a 5"" deep pocket....for this Pack & Play.So my question is...how does one put a sheet on this thing, or am I to lay my sweet grand-dot on the plastic cover of the very firm pad that it came with?And REALLY! you shouldn't use a mattress in this? While the pad is soft enough for a newborn....any baby heavier will ""bottom out"" on the thin pad it comes with and be sleeping on the hard support.So this gets only a 3 star from me. Because I am puzzled as to how to use it, if I will use it, should I return it.....are there better options out there? Come on Amazon don't sell us bogus side products that won't work with what we purchased...and give us enough info to know what we are buying. That means you too Graco.Now any suggestions from those using this item as to how to put a sheet on it (and where to find those sheets) do you use a mattress etc, would be greatly appreciated.Thanks.Happy new grand mum"
22883,1,"I was really interested in ""baby-wearing"" but didn't want to spend $70 on a sling. I ordered this because the price was attractive and the reviews of the other ""Lite-on-Shoulder"" slings got good reviews. This is a very well-made product and it is also very pretty. It adjusts and works very well. It is taking me some time getting used to positioning my little one in the sling but went to the website and there are many videos that demonstrate how to do it. I did not find the pamphlet that they sent with the sling to be very helpful. The pictures were very poor quality and I am definitely a ""visual learner"". So if you are anything like me I suggest watching the videos. Overall, a very good product for the price!"
166778,1,"We had already purchased a bunch of Huggies Ultratrims, when we received a free sample of the swaddlers. It was too bad there were only 2 samples and we had whole box of Huggies.The swaddlers fit and hold the mess a lot better then Huggies. We have not had any leaks with these, while there had been plenty with the Huggies. They are so soft to the touch. Plus they have a really nice baby smell :)Of course when amazon.com had them for 7.49 they were a much better deal. Oh well!!"
46808,1,Ordered a few of these letters. They are so cute and have a very nice finished. Price was very reasonable as well.
147614,2,"This hat was just way too small. My daughter does have a large head, but I ordered this when she was 5 months old and it was too tight."
54400,1,"I wasn't sure at first if I liked this mobile, but my son made the decision for me...he absolutely LOVED it! He's seven months old now and about a month ago had started to grab it and pull it down, so I had to remove it. I know it's only recommended for under 5 months old, but my son loved it most at 5 and 6 months. If you can lower the crib mattress, it's great to keep as long as you can. We both miss it so much now that it's gone! Buy this mobile - it's definitely worth it's weight in gold to keep your child entertained and (for my son, at least) to help him or her get to sleep."
136837,0,"It's a pretty skirt. That being said...It's very long. Once the crib mattress is lowered the whole way, its on the floor."
75394,2,"Be careful! your door need 90 degree angle for this product to mount. Besides, the attached screw is in bad quality and easy to bend. The attached screw could not make a straight punch because it's too easy to bend(very soft)!!! I punch lots of extra failure holes becayse of the defect screw."
2316,0,"We have two children under 3 who wear these diapers on a regular basis, and I have to say it's hit or miss with them. We've had a number of them fall apart really, really badly, with a huge mess to clean up. Just imagine all the stuffing coming out of the diaper, all over the place, with urine on it - BAD. I know that there's a warning about some sort of crystals being left on the kids bottom and to not be alarmed and we've had that too, but for the whole inside of the diaper to fall out all over their bed and the floor? Yuck. That's a bedding change and wash, bath for the kid, and vacuum AND deep cleaning for the carpet. I've never had that happen with Huggies Little Movers and much prefer those diapers over the Cruisers. Still, this is what we buy if there's nothing better on sale. Even with the occassional nasty random falling apart of the Cruisers they're STILL better than Luvs, which is coincidently the same company (P&G)."
153486,0,"We have enjoyed these, but the tub I got only had four blue tablets, so we are rather limited in what colors we can make."
65979,1,"My son had allot of problems with colic and digestive upset. He was switched soon after birth to Nutragamin because of this, and still spent MANY MANY hours a day fussing and crying. We purchased the Dr. Brown bottles before he was born based on the reviews and started to wonder if they were really helping so we tried a regular Gerber bottle and the results were horrible! Even though his colic was still terrible he very rarely spit up until we tried the other bottle. My conclusion was that even though he still had terrible colic these bottles did do what they promised and a baby that was suffering from mild to moderate colic would probably benefit greatly from them. At 6 months now his colic has abated and I still won't switch to another bottle. Yes, they do take a little extra time to wash, but the results are worth it. I have found that boiling them daily is easier and cleaner than the dishwasher gets them and after all of this time they are still in great shape, I've just had to replace the nipples. These bottles are definetly worth the money and I have reccommended them to all of my friends and family, who also have had great success with them.One note though: if you fail to use the plastic disk while traveling they do tend to leak. This isn't a major problem, I know, but has led to a few minor disasters with a wet car seat when the bottle has toppled over in transit."
127615,0,"The cradle arrived and was easy enough to assemble. The pad which comes with the crib is by no means adequate to support a baby. You will need to buy a cradle sized mattress. Also, the wheels do not stay within their sockets, and the cradle is difficult to roll around on the carpet. This is not a high quality product. I am going to try it out when baby arrives, but I would not purchase this item again, having seen it. I hope to be pleasantly surprised. The cradle is attractive."
72890,2,"Don't like at all!! Very hard and uncomfortable and my baby hates it!! Its only good for quick snacks, it's not a product made with baby in mind it's more for a dog... I know crazy right but out tea cup pup loves it, it's hers now! Spend a bit more and get something useful."
164806,1,Love the fact that I can buy diapers for both my kids in bulk without having to leave my house!
125235,0,"My son is 5 months and we got this because he was chomping on everything. Its a good teether, but the part that you would normally put in his mouth is a little big. He does however like chewing the handle part which has a vine design on it. Must feel pretty good because that is his favorite part. Maybe he is just a little small for this but it was a bit big for him, would work better with an older baby."
184453,1,"I love this cosleeper- it is simple and it works. My baby sleeps in it at least a few hours every night without fussing, because he can smell and hear me right on the other side of it... as an anthropologist, I know that cosleeping with an infant has many benefits, not the least of which is that it reduces the risk of SIDS. Still, we are told over an over again in our own society that there is a serious risk of rolling over the baby (although this is actually very rare, unless someone is intoxicated!) This product allows me the peace of mind to know baby is safe, allows him the peace of mind of knowing I am close, and makes it impossible for me or my husband to squash him in our current sleep-deprived state.Some people have said babies legs end up protruding out of the cosleeper - and this has happened with my baby. That is why the bottom half is soft instead of hard plastic! His face cannot get squished into the mattress or sheets, so he can always breath, and he doesn't end up with dents in his legs when he flings his feet out towards me. The top half of his body has never gotten out of the sleeper, and even when he squishes his face up against the side he can breath because there is a net that covers an open air-space in the frame, which prevents suffocation.Bottom line - I love this thing. It is allowing me to get some sleep!"
30163,2,Liked the smaller taggies at Target better. This was not a great material. Felt kind of cheap. Our daughter didn't even like it.
80547,1,This is good product and we can easy to use. Kids are feeling happy when we use easy ups instead of Other products. They are playing and feeling freely and comfortable.
72187,0,"My six month old likes it okay. The music panel is great! She loves to play the music. But I think the rest of the activties could be a bit better. The fish are a downright waste of space. The buttons are supposed to push some force through the fish pond to make them swim around. However, it doesn't work. They don't move. She does teethe on the soft squeaky bird."
119802,2,My daughter like this chair but when i put the tray on she keeps poping it off with her legs she is only four months old and we won't be able to use the tray for much longer as its getting to tight.So i'm terrified that she is going to fall out of it.
50803,1,"My mother bought this for me as a gift when I was 11 weeks pregnant. I had already started to have aching in my hips periodically. This pillow is wonderful, I sleep so soundly and wake up refreshed. Ignore the complaints about fabric, just don't expect silk or Egyptian cotton. I feel like it is adequately stuffed. I am 5'10 and have no problem curling right into this pillow. This pillow is a pregnant woman's best friend when the sleep problems start to set it. Totally worth it!"
14180,0,"These are actually my favorite bottles from all the different ones we ended up with. My reasons:They don't come in a million pieces like ventAires, but they're still round, unlike the gerber one we have. These things put them at the top of my list for easy cleaning. The nipple flow is alright, too. It's not the slowest to start out with, but it's slower than some other nipples that automatically come with some bottles.So, why did I only give it three stars? I haven't found anything that says these are BP-A free, which, for me, knocks them down two stars. Too bad."
183030,2,"This stroller ""could"" be great. Here are the negs:I have come to realize I hate the handles (doesn't work for single handed steering), canopy is eh - doesn't shade much at all BUT these two issues aren't deal breakers this IS a $29.00 stroller not a bugaboo. What IS the deal breaker is that as other reviewers have stated this seat is WAY TOO NARROW and not deep enough. Let me make sure you all know exactly how narrow this seat it...My son was a PREEMIE. He's skinny as can be and very very narrow and he is STUFFED into this seat. Well not anymore, I'm getting rid of it. It worked for us for about a month. Yes the wheels are very good but not if my son can't ride in it (my handbag can't even ride in it, it's too shallow). Looks hot (for an umbrella stroller) and sounds good but don't fall for it's sexy style - this is a complete waste."
21273,1,I was given this pillow by a friend after I mentioned that I was struggling to keep my newborn baby at my breast while nursing at night. It is a wonderful product! At first I used it to wedge the baby to me and so she did not move at all while nursing. Before the pillow she would start nursing and I would doze off and then she would too and soon she would be howling because she'd lost the nipple. The pillow solved that problem. Now that she is a couple of months old I do not need to wedge her that much as she can stay connected on her own. But I still actively use the pillow every night and during her nap time in the day. It keeps her safely on the bed and I do not worry about her rolling away. It is also great for keeping Dad from rolling on her during sleep. A must have!
181812,1,"We've been through many many diaper bags. This one is very durable and well made. The pockets are in logical places and allow for a lot of storage. The only thing I would change would be some of the pockets open too far, causing some things to spill out if the bag is extra full."
170868,2,"I wish I would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item! These are flimsy, thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter. I'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad. Fortunately there are other products that work better...if this was the only option, I might as well not have a sheet on at all."
166397,1,"Really good deal, good fit, keeps baby dry. Recommend auto-delivery. You're sent a 10- day email reminder, providing an opportunity to delay shipment, change size or style if you need to."
117310,1,"This gate was the third product I purchased to keep my terrier mix puppy/kangaroo confined while I'm at work. The gate was packaged very securely and included all the parts shown (individually wrapped, it felt like), along with a sheet with three different installation options, depending on the width. It was a little confusing at first, since the hallway is 36"" (the listed maximum is 35.8""), and I had to use the extensions. It took maybe 40 minutes to put it together, in part because 1) I installed it above the baseboards for a little more height-hard to keep it elevated and put it together at the same time, and 2) I had to keep re-reading the instructions to make sure I was following the right one. After installation and tweaking, it looks nice and is very sturdy. The door swings smoothly and is easy to open. I leave it open when I'm home, and it V's against the wall and holds.As a test, I left the dog behind the gate for a few hours while I was out running errands. He met me at the door when I got home. I considered raising it even higher, but as I was thinking it, he was flat on the floor sticking his face in the gap under the gate :-) For now, I just back two dining room chairs in front of it before I leave, and so far, he's stayed put. Even though he can jump the gate, I like it, and plan to keep it up."
134559,1,"We have owned this stroller for 2 1/2 years and can tell you, without any reservation, the Stokke Xplory has proven to be the wisest purchase we have made in a very long time.Above all of it's many great features, the Stokke Xplory has offered our child an opportunity to cruise ""up"" with the rest of us and see his new world in a way those without a Stokke Explory are missing. Our boy continues to loves riding in his Xplory!Yes, the Xplory breaks down a bit slower than some until you get the hang of it. When the day is done, you will not be ""folding it"" as often. The fact that you never have to ask for a highchair, make the baby transfer from stroller to highchair, unload baby stuff, fold the stroller and then find a spot to stuff the stroller... well you get it.This stroller was a ""zero based"" design from the ground up. It requires you to rethink what you thought you knew about strollers. Very easy to pass this on this one. DON'T. After more that 2 years of using this device, I can not tell how many of Mommy's friends now say ""...we should have bought one of those to begin with!"""
179504,1,"I was traveling alone with my 19 month old son and needed a way to transport his carseat since I had a stroller to use at our destination. It was REALLY easy to put together and fit my Britax Marathon car seat perfect. It has adjustments to fit different sized seats I had a small adjustment to make. The wheels are really easy to take off and on, not sure if this is something they fixed from what I read of older models. It just made the daunting task of traveling alone with a toddler a lot easier."
63960,1,"Good idea for babies in these winter months. However, when it is LARGE, it should be LARGE for bigger babies."
98955,0,"I had Pampers DryMax (?) from the hospital and loved them - wet indicator and pretty padded for newborn baby. These are much cheaper - almost paperlike with no wet indicator. They worked well enough, but be careful if you're looking for the DryMax or Swaddlers."
43462,1,"I use this with my Graco snugride 32 car seat in Zurich and it is super easy to set up and get going. Everything you need to unfold or needs to snap into place on the frame is red colored which coordinates with the Graco car seat; it is fast to set up once you practice a couple times. I am also a big weakling and I have to say it is very easy to maneuver this stroller, it feels lightweight not heavy at all. I am 5'3 and find the height perfect (the handlebars can be adjusted).My only caveat is that I wish the basket sat a little lower and deeper so it would be easier to place and retrieve the diaper bag (we use a backpack)."
164280,1,"Hi,We tried lots of different brand of diapers for my baby including different kind of huggies, Costco branded, babiesus branded etc. but most of them would give my baby rashes or they would not last for more than 6 hours. Once we started using Pampers, they last for more than 1o hours and no rashes. We are happy and our baby is happy too!"
72866,2,"I gave it a one star because its okay as a TRAVEL booster seat. It's not comfy at all, our baby gets fussy in it because she's uncomfortable in it. There's no padding or cushion padding at all, it's all plastic. We also put the tray in our dishwasher, bottom rack, and the tray somehow stuck to our heating-pan, I think that's what it's called (?) in the bottom of the dishwasher. So I dont recommend washing it in the dishwasher, it's really simple to clean anyways. The straps get pretty dirty pretty fast and when we washed them in the washing machine my husband had a hard time figuring out how to put them back on the booster seat.So with all those things, it has now become our traveling booster seat, and it's fine for that!"
54222,0,"I don't know where the child care industry gets the idea that bright colors and geometric shapes are &quot;soothing.&quot; I got this mobile as a gift but my 3-month-old daughter does NOT like it at all. She pulls up her arms and stares at it sideways, looking completely freaked out. I agree with a fellow reviewer; it is TOO much stimulation. My daughter's original mobile had pastel moons and stars and she would dance under it at coo at it. Too bad the motor on that one broke!The music on this mobile is very nice, however; not your typical tinny electronic beeps (what my mom calls &quot;tacky music&quot;). It sounds like a real piano. I wish they would make more music boxes for children's toys like this!"
28413,1,"Being 8 months pregnant, I couldn't have asked for an easier assembly... Super fast and I did it all by myself. The chair is comfy and way affordable. Love it and definitely recommend it!"
22134,1,"I've used these storage bags with both children. I never had a problem with leaks or anything else. They're a little on the expensive side, but worth it because they are great."
80302,2,"Purchased this mattress to go with the Delta Riley mini crib, only to find that the crib box says not to use a mattress pad more than 2"" thick (this mattress is ca 5"" thick). So we had to send it back... at our own expense (amazon did not fully cover return shipping). Wah-wah!"
88618,1,The baby dry diapers are great. My daughter has been using them since she was 3 months old (now 15 months) and has never had any rashs or leaks in them. I will not be ordering these from Amazon anymore. They have changed the discount on the MOM program so that it's not worth it anymore.
79247,1,"A friend of mine introduced me to California Baby about a year and a half ago. I am so pleased with all their products and this diaper cream is far superior to anything I've used before. The smell is pleasant, the consistency effective and there are no chemicals. I am on a crusade to support non-Chinese companies and California Baby fits the bill.I've been giving this out as a gift at all the baby showers I've been attending lately."
152390,0,I purchased two of these items for our DVD player and our cable box/dvr. They do deter my 11-month-old from touching the buttons to change the channel or open the dvd player but if the buttons are raised she can still push the entire glass and get a response. Often it just brings up the menu on our cable.
55706,2,"I too am disappointed with this warmer. It is very inconsistent in heating the bottles. Although we use the same amount of water in the warmer each time, the bottle never comes out the same. Sometimes it's just right, but more often it is over or under heated. The enclosed booklet tells how much water should be added for each bottle type and size. It is grossly off. We basically fill the measuring tube full for a 6 oz bottle and heat with the lid off so we can stick our (clean) finger in ever few seconds to test and make sure it isn't overheating. As another review mentioned, it's extremely frustrating when it doesn't heat the bottle enough because it takes 10 minutes to cool down before you can rewarm. Don't waste your money."
174452,2,"Well, I've had the product home for all of 30 minutes (the entire time spent putting it together) and now I set it up on the crib and turn it on and disappointment sets in. The motor makes this grating clicking noise!!! Even more annoying, it will make the noise for a minute then act like it has stopped, only to start again. The toys are cute and I am really upset that it has this MAJOR flaw. So I guess we are headed back to return it, lots of fun at 37 weeks pregnant!! Why can no one make a battery powered mobile that works?!?! We can send people to the moon but a mobile that works on any premise other than wind-up is apparently too complicated :("
12052,1,I love this pillow. It is just enough to level off my stomach and keep it from hanging to the side while I sleep. A must have for last few months.
168433,1,"As any parent will tell you, there's no such thing as a leak proof diaper. You could probably diaper a baby with duct tape and a leak would still find a way to escape. Pampers Swaddlers come as close to leak proof as anything I've found, though, even overnight.My little one is still quite little, and we've only gone through about 1000 diapers at this point. We did some experimenting with brands at first, and had quite a few messy situations. Once we tried Pampers Swaddlers, we stopped searching. In about 700 diaper changes, she's had two leaks. That, my friends, is pretty amazing.These are easy to put on, as well. There's no fumbling around for tabs or proper positioning. Put the diaper under the baby, grab the velco-like tabs and attach them. They stay stuck quite securely, and I've never had one come off.Are they pricey? Sure. They definitely cost a bit more than other diapers. Look for Amazon Coupons and Subscribe and Save. I snagged a box of 234 for 29 bucks here the other day. The slightly higher price is still competitive, and when you're NOT stumbling around at 3am for a change of clothes and new crib bedding, you'll agree it's worth it, too."
14638,0,"We USE to love Avent bottles, we used them exclusively when our son was born 4 years ago. I nursed and bottle fed and it worked out great, we loved the bottles! However, when my daughter was born, we bought new nipples but used the same bottles and we hate them! They leak ALL THE TIME, we try not tightening them too much or tightening them a lot, we make sure the nipple is in place correctly and we make sure the ring is on the bottle correctly. They leak 95% of the time, milk everywhere, all over the new carpet, all over the new car, all over the freshly dressed child! UGH. My daughter is 12 months old now and it seems the older the bottles get, the more they leak. I was so frustrated tonight, I threw them away and went and bought two new bottles of another brand. We'll be off the bottle soon but I can no longer live with milk everywhere. Sorry Advent, I use to be a fan but I am not so sure anymore!"
90926,1,"I purcased these diapers because I have a big 2 1/2 year old and needed diapers that would fit his larger frame. I tried other brands but they were too narrow, thus causing more diaper leaks. These fit my son well and are a less expensive option to Pampers Cruisers. However, I do think the tabs need to be roomier. One advantage Huggies diapers has over Pampers are their tabs - they always seem to be big enough, wheras Pampers have to be fitted just right. Evenso, I still recommend these diapers. They are slightly cheaper than the Huggies Snug and Dry and I think Pampers are more absorbant."
11319,2,"This monitor is horrible! I thought the idea was nice, lights indicate noise level as well the sound. Static is horrible! It squeals for no reason, even when I'm across the house from the base! On channel B, the sound goes in and out for no reason. And the batteries died so quickly, in the middle of the night while I was sleeping no less! I didn't hear my daughter until she was screaming and wailing! Thank God it has a cord to plug it in as well, which is how I use it now, but that is SO inconvenient! The monitor picks up the baby in the downstairs apartment crying through the floor clearly, so why does my daughter sound distorted? And the newest thing: it now picks up a radio station! As my boyfriend says, we'd be better off using walkie-talkies with the button taped down on the one in our daughter's room!!!"
28992,1,It was purchased for my grandson. My daughter specifically asked for this type of Nipple Drop-Ins.I got what she wanted.
161383,2,"Not only did the bathtub leak, the sling was not appropriate for tiny babies. The thin material didn't adequately pad the metal support, so the baby's tailbone was resting on a solid metal bar! Even if the tub had not leaked, I would not have used it until the baby could sit up. Not a good tub for small babies."
162845,2,This product is more of a Chinese finger trap than anything else. The three pack came as a two pack and an additional single cup. Only one of the three had a lid that would hold in the snacks.
41110,0,"It is not the same product, we buy at walwamrt ot other superstore...there is difference in the quality...."
182758,2,"and now are thinner and do me no more good than the regular diapers from Costco. The previous style were much thicker and more absorbent but my last two shipments have had a different, thinner diaper. Beware!"
168224,1,"The hospital started my baby out in these. At home I tried Luvs and Baby Dry. Both pale in comparison to these diapers. Shipping is not only free, but I usually get it within 2 business days! Wonderful brand and deal."
114510,1,"My booster seat has been used by 4 different children, and still looks like new.Used daily for the past 5 years, and still like new. Very good quality, well made, I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a ""portable high chair""."
101378,0,I totaly regret my decision on ordering this stroller. At first glance I was ready to rate the stroller as a perfect ten. It is sturdy. The seat is very padded and made of strong long lasting material. The tray would be hard to remove by your child but easy for an adult. It reclines flat and uses a bar not a string.Then the first trip around the block the wheels began squeaking. The sun shade is not long enough to cover very well. I'm only 5'2 and I kept kicking the braking bar. When you flip the handle bar around so the child is facing you it is very hard to manuver. And good luck folding the thing it is very hard to avoid not scratching up the tray and definetly requires two hands and a lot of patience. I don't usually rate products but this stroller is in need of some improvements.
96418,0,This lever lock would be great if you didn't have a sneaky 3 year old to figure out how to open it. We used it on our front door to keep our toddler from going outside but it is not working all the time.
28268,1,"I was anxious to get this product, thinking it came with the ottoman too? Nothing in the description to say any different and the picture even shows an ottoman. Once I got it, I emailed the supplier and asked about it. They could do nothing for me. I was a bit disappointed in that. Buyer beware.But, the chair itself is great! Very comfortable. Good cushioning on the seat and back and sides. No creaking. Color on both the wood and cushions are great! Very happy. Now I just have to see if I can order the ottoman to go with it...bummer."
158838,2,"We tried several different brands of bottles. Dr. Browns failed us on several levels. 1) My son gasped and burped the most using Dr. Browns 2) they are a pain in the neck to clean. Playtex dropins worked well in preventing burping, but are a pain when mixing formula. The best of the bunch was Avent. Avent occasionally leaks, but I'll take that over a burpy/fussy baby AND they are easy to clean and easy to mix formula in."
25523,0,"I have been pleased with the performance of this product overall. I do agree that they are too big for the diaper but I also cut them in half and double my amount, making a perfect fit.HOWEVER, I would be very careful about flushing these. I just spent $225 for a plumber to come and snake out our main drain. Guess what he found? A big wad of diaper liners (and I've only been using them for two weeks and flushing only the soiled #2 ones). From now on they will be bagged and go in the trash. he said they probably would not create an issue if the drain was brand new PVC, but the old style drains cannot tolerate such products. Buyer beware!!!"
14579,1,"The Avent line of bottles came highly recomended. I am a first time mom and had no clue of what brand to pick. I have had no problems with these bottles. The top leaked on me one time, but I think it was because the ring was not screwed in properly. I readjusted the ring and it did not leak further.We wash them with a bottle cleaner, let them dry and sterilize them with the Avent sterilizer(which I highly recomend!). We also heat them up in the Avent bottle warmer. (My husband got a little carried away with the brand and purchased almost the whole line of products, but I must say I am happy he did.)The sanitizer comes with a pair of tongs to pull the nipple through the ring. You can really tell that the nipple is in the ring properly. I am not sure if that is why there has been virtually no leaking, but I must say I am surpirsed that anyone has had any problems. I have seen alot of foam when I use the powder formula, but when I use the concentrated, mix with water type, I have only had a little bit of bubbles.My baby was over 9 pounds when born and we started her on the number 2 nipple. The 1's were hard for her to feed from. She also had no problem switching from breast to bottle at all. The bottles are comfortable to hold and easy to take care of. I am glad they were recomended to me and can not imagine using another type."
125168,1,This teether is a god send. I would highly recommend for any child that is currently teething and I am very happy with this product. Thanks
159885,1,"I purchased this gate for keeping my dog out of certain rooms. I love it! So much better than the gate we had when the kids were small. The bonus is that there are no grates for the dog to crawl up and the clear plastic lets light through but does not let my little barky dog see squirrels on the deck. Easy to use, remove & replace!"
51396,1,"We have used these diapers with our daughter from 6 weeks to almost two years and they have held up wonderfully. I believe having a front-loading washer adds significantly to the life of the diapers (we have not had issues with the velcro coming off as some of our friends have). The diapers have fit well throughout her life and we have had no problems with leaking. They are also easy to wash and our parents/babysitters have all been able to use them without difficulty. The only issue we have had is a slight odor which seems to be from detergent build-up (probably more common with the high-efficiency washers). Stripping the diapers as recommended on the website solved the problem. Our daughter is now 24 months (though just 22 pounds) and potty-trained, so we have retired the diapers to be used with our second who will be born in three months.Addendum: We have now used the same set of 18 diapers through 2 children and they are ready for #3 who is expected in a few months! Halfway through use with number 2, we purchased the repair kits ($1/diaper on cottonbabies.com) and replaced the velcro and elastic as both were quite worn out. After that, they were as good as new! A friend did the work for us and mentioned the elastic was sometimes quite difficult to remove from the leg openings. FYI."
169606,1,"I did not what a ""cute"" baby bag. I wanted just a normal looking bag. I like when they can go over my head to my other shoulder, otherwise I always feel like it is slipping. The strap is adjustable, perfect. The only thing is the color was much darker then I thought. It looks like a denim color in the picture but it is defiantly a Navy blue, the zippers are grey. It also seems larger then the picture. It defiantly has room for everything."
153764,2,"Although I do like the features of this monitor, it just isn't worth it for me. I live in a city and quite honestly all my neighbors must have 900 Mhz cordless phones. I have tried both the channels and no matter which one I am on, I hear the conversations of all my neighbors on the phone. The voices are quite loud when they come through from other sources as well. My son and I were watching TV and when the monitor began with its possession it really startled both of us. I realized what was going on but he is still upset every time it makes a sound."
78607,0,"ok, here's the deal with this thing....it's hard to get on and off. in fact, i never attempted it. my husband was in charge of that situation. we strictly used this item to attach the carseat to one of our bags. we never used it as a ""Stroller"" of sorts for our son to ride in. it was just an easy way to get all our bags and car seat to the check-in counter. once at check-in that car seat got checked and we just used an umbrella stroller (you can take them on airplanes, it's ok) through the airport, which we didn't even use ALL that much b/c the more our 2 year old could run around, the less he'd want to run on the airplane. anyway...we felt it served our purposes, however, i wouldn't use it through the airport. i'd hate to get that thing in and out of security. it's just not THAT easy to attach and unattach. it's a great idea in theory, but the reality is that it's not great for everything it claims to be. I hope that makes sense. 5 stars for being able to attach it and get it into the airport (frees up hands), but beyond check-in...i dunno, wouldn't use it. would probably be a pain. Unless you REALLY practiced with it."
52125,0,"We liked this carseat because it had a higher weight limit for the internal harness, which was necessary for our 35 pound wiggly 3 year old. However, the seat seems to be very difficult to tighten on our child. We were used to a more user-friendly restraint system and have still not gotten used to the way the harness tightens."
176761,1,"We have used this bottle warmer for over a year with my twin girls. I can put their bottle on to heat, change their diaper, and its normally finished by time I'm done. I was so glad it could hold two bottles in the cooler, one for each of them. It does take a little playing with the water levels and how much milk you are wanting to heat, but once you figure it out, its great. So much quicker and easier than using hot water! We have overheated a few bottles, especially if you can't pull the bottle out when it goes off, but we just kept a cup ready to use cold water to cool them down, it only took an extra minute or two."
153720,1,"When I first had my daughter, I was using clothespins and blankets to protect her from the sun. This shade has velcro fasteners that can attach to any part of your stroller to create any degree of shade you want. It is aslo very thin so it's breathable and it can really look like part of your stroller (at least more so than blankets and clothespins) I want another one so I don't have to keep switching it from stroller to stroller."
180140,1,"Harmony Personal Use Manual BreastpumpI am on my second child, and have tried almost every pump there is. This one is by far the easiest to use, quickest to clean, and most effective at removing milk quickly.1. The very best part is the two-phase system: you use your thumb to pump quickly on the top button just like baby sucks really fast when she first attaches. Then once milk starts flowing, usually within thirty seconds for me with this pump, you switch to the longer, harder pulls with the handle. It's brilliant. Truly.2. The breast shield is rigid yet slightly soft, so it really does mimic the suction of Baby's mouth further up on the breast. No other pump I've tried has this added feature. Sometimes when I'm not looking I actually can't tell which side she's on, it's that good.3. The handle swivels, which is marvelous as I usually pump one side while nursing Baby on the other (I've found this the best way to get the most milk and easy let-down). With other pumps, it's been difficult to get the right angle without spilling milk. The swivel handle allows me to keep the pump at a good angle but move the handle so that my hand can pump.4. The removable handle makes it easy to clean, and I've had no assembly problems as there are few parts to mess with.5. I keep the removable base attached most of the time, so I can set it down without it tipping over.6.I have been using it twice daily for a month, and it is still as good as new.How it rates against others:Second place: Ameda hand pump: I had this one with my son, and loved it. It was given to me free at the hospital by my lactation consultant, but I would be willing to pay full price for it happily. However, the handle requires one to squeeze, and my hand got tired much more quickly. I thought this couldn't be improved, but the the Harmony blows this otherwise excellent pump out of the water.Third place: Avent Isis: this pump is not worth the hype. It's handle is too painful to use, it is bulky and difficult, the breast sheilds don't ever lock on to the breast very well, and it was difficult to use. Once it got going, it would get a decent amount of milk, but I never liked it as well as the Ameda and certainly nowhere near the Medela. The hand pump tired out my hand terribly.Fourth place: Lansinoh double electric: I broke down and forked out the cash on an electric with baby #2 because everyone swore by them. I chose this one because it used the same design as the Ameda that I had liked with baby #1. I thought an electric was a good idea. All I can say before you spend all that money... DON'T! The ONLY thing better about an electric is that your hand doesn't get tired, but the Harmony has the least hand fatigue of any manual I've tried, and it's worth the time saved. Electrics just don't pump as strongly or as quickly as baby sucks, so it takes FOREVER, and I mean forever, to get any milk. I wanted to pull my hair out waiting. Even with baby on the other side, I would only get 2, maybe 2.5 ounces in the same amount of time that I can get 4.5-5 with the Harmony, 4 with the Ameda, 3.5 with the Isis, or about 3 with the Evenflo. Electrics sound like a good idea, but they're really not. The biggest pain is that they are extremely bulky and have to be set up before each use. When baby is hungry, this is not a good idea! Then trying to undo the bottles for storage while holding baby... just impossible. This pump made her so angry. I used it for about a week and a half before I got the Harmony, which is so much lighter, quicker to assemble, easy to use, lightweight, etc.Last place: Evenflo: Don't ever purchase this thing. It's a waste of money, even at the low price point. The pumping action is terrible, it doesn't keep suction, and unless you have giant man-sized hands it is too big for holding and falls over if you set it down. It is cheap, and everything about it is cheap. I rarely regret losing $[...]20 to try something, but I do with this thing!I just had to pump both sides at the same time, and thought I could use my Harmony and my Evenflo... I got 1 ounce on the Evenflo side, and 4.5 on the Harmony side. Same time, same let down, that much of a difference!"
86074,0,"We got the monitor as a shower gift. It worked well for the first 9 months, but after that the volume didn't work all of the time. Some times in the middle of the night it would go silent and we would not hear our son crying. I gave it three stars because the video quality is pretty good and it worked really well at first. Today we broke down and ordered a new one through woot.com so I hope the new one is better and last a little longer. I love having the video on it to see why he is crying and to know if he needs me or not - this is how we got our son to sleep through the night."
113082,1,"Bought this for my new grandson--works great, he loves the toy, really helps entertainment issue while preparing food. Only downfall, is not ""one hand"" tray operation."
84766,1,"These door knob covers have been life savers. My 2.5yr old daughter has gotten out of the house twice and onto the street by herself without our knowledge and needless to say, both were the scariest moments of my life. Since we got these she hasnt been able to open the doors, ofcourse she's tried million times to no avail. Now she's given up trying, we have them on doors leading outside and some doors inside we want her to stay out of. They just roll around the knob when she tries but very easy for adults to open. Once she slammed the door knob against the wall to crack it open but that was because she had removed the door stoppers but they've been replaced so she cant slam them again."
94821,2,"I wanted to love these wipes...they are SO soft! But we use wipes solution in a spray bottle and wet the wipes as we go, and when these wipes are sprayed, the liquid doesn't soak in readily and almost seems to bounce off the fabric. Also, after washing the wipes one time, before even using them, the stitching around the edges started unraveling. Am really disappointed. Returned these to Amazon. I have other flannel wipes from a WAHM from a certain website where you can buy handmade items, and they are far superior to these wipes."
150312,1,We have three of these (in Ecru a.k.a. off white) and it fits the Babies R Us contoured changing pad we have. Its nice and soft for our baby to lay on while we are changing her. Its also easy to take on and off to switch out for a new one. I originally had one but realized it was good to have extras in case of accidents so bought 2 more. No complaints from me!
116839,0,"Up side: We like the bag for the size of it. It holds more than enough to get through the three day cycle of washing our cloth diapers and wipes. The quality of the material is good and has lasted through many cycles of washing and drying it in the dryer. We have 2 bags so that we to have one ready while the other is being washed.Down side: The draw string doesn't draw so easily. The cord is stretchy and the material doesn't want to scrunch together easily, and it takes great effort to get the bag to leave a small enough opening to get the diapers into the pail. Therefore, for the stinky diapers, it doesn't hold in the odor because you can't draw it tight. We hang ours next to the changing table and not a secondary container. Perhaps if you otherwise have the pail in a secondary, closed container, you won't have an issue."
171589,0,I like this particular tub but I found one fatal flaw-whoever designed it put the drain on the bottom of the tub flush with the tub or sink. To drain out excess water or drain period you end up spilling or having to bail out the water with a cup. I find the tubs with the drains on the sides work much better with less mess.
31017,2,"I spent a few weeks researching tandem strollers and finally settled on the Joovy Caboose Ultralight. I was very disappointed when it arrived. I used it for a couple of weeks before finally selling it on craigslist, taking a loss, because there are a couple of huge design flaws that I couldn't live with. I then bought the Baby Trend Sit n Stand LX and love it. First of all, it is about $100 cheaper than the Joovy, and, in this case at least, more expensive certainly does not mean better.I have a 4-year-old and a 2-month-old. I knew that my 4-year-old would want to walk on outings but hop on a stroller when she got tired. I also knew that I'd be using the infant carseat with the stroller for at least four more months with my infant son.There are three things about the Joovy that I preferred to the Sit n Stand (minor things that are not deal breakers by any means):1. The Joovy is lighter (by about four pounds), so it is slightly easier to turn and maneuver than the Sit n Stand; its wheels also seem to roll a little more smoothly. However, the maneuverability comes at the sacrifice of function (more about this later).2. The Joovy neoprene parent organized has a ton of space for keys, wallet, and phone and is very functional. The Sit n Stand parent organizer is a hard shell; it has room for two smaller water bottles, which is great, but neither my keys nor my BlackBerry will fit in the middle closed compartment, thus rendering it nearly useless - it's just too small to be functional.3. The oversized canopy on the Joovy covers both kids, which is nice on a very hot and sunny day or in case you get caught in a rainstorm. However, the canopy is also bulky and a little cumbersome; when you don't need it fully open, it gets in the way.That being said, there are many things I prefer about the Sit n Stand:1. The Sit n Stand is a little lower to the ground and thus feels more stable when moving.2. The Sit n Stand has a carseat attachment that you can snap the infant carrier into. The Joovy Caboose attachment is really a tray that the infant carrier sits ON TOP OF; it does NOT snap in, something Joovy obviously does not advertise because it's very cumbersome and annoying. To secure the infant carrier on the Joovy, you have to strap it in with an ugly red strap; even with the strap, the infant carrier sits awkwardly on top of the tray and doesn't feel like it's secure. In the instruction booklet, Joovy actually advises that parents check the carrier every few minutes to make sure the strap that holds it attached to the stroller isn't loose. The Sit n Stand attachment is awesome - the carrier snaps right in and is tight and secure in the front seat of the stroller.3. The Joovy basket is very small and hard to get into. I could barely get my purse in there, much less a diaper bag. The Sit n Stand basket is larger and has snaps on the side that you can open, thus making the basket easily accessible and usable.4. The Sit n Stand can be folded with one hand; the Joovy cannot.5. The Sit n Stand actually folds smaller than the Joovy. It's a bit thicker when folded but significantly shorter, so it will fit in all trunks. The Joovy is VERY tall when folded and wouldn't fit in the trunk of my friend's Honda.6. The front seat on the Joovy is very shallow, only 8 inches. The depth of the Sit n Stand front seat is about 10 inches, making it much more functional for older kids. I could see my son, who's average size, outgrowing the Joovy seat by the time he's 18-months-old. He'll be able to use the Sit n Stand much longer.7. The Sit n Stand has a removable kid tray that easily snaps off with one hand. Once the younger child is older and bigger, it's easy to remove him/her from the stroller without lifting him/her over the top of the tray. The Joovy tray is very difficult to remove (I actually couldn't do it; my husband had to do it for me).8. However, the most obnoxious thing about the Joovy, and the main reason I traded it for the Sit n Stand, is that the back toddler bench seat is very small and moves/slides all the time, which is annoying and distracting for the kid AND the parent. Also, when the front seat is reclined (necessary to hold the infant carrier and for a younger child or a child who still naps during the day), it reclines halfway INTO the back bench seat, taking up about half the room of an already small seat. The older child then either has to stand (not great on long trips) or sit hunched forward with his/her feet awkwardly curled behind. This is a pretty big design flaw that I could not overlook. It makes the back seat essentially useless unless the front seat is not reclined. The Sit n Stand back bench seat is slightly larger, and the front seat, even when reclined, does not get in the way of the bench seat. The older child can thus sit comfortably upright even with the front seat inclined. The standing platform on the Sit n Stand is also larger and has a strap that you can buckle behind the child that the child can use for back support; the Joovy doesn't have this.Considering the above, the Sit n Stand LX is the hands-down winner. For nearly half the price, you get a much better, more functional stroller. Had I ""test driven"" both, I never would have bought the Joovy Caboose Ultralight. I think the Joovy looks kind of funky and trendy, so people fall for it, but it's a poorly thought-out stroller that is terribly overhyped."
146293,1,Bought for my grandbaby and she enjoys it but is only 3 months old so still getting used to thing.
25537,1,"These are a must have for cloth diapering. They catch the solids and can be flushed, or if they are just wet I put them through the wash with the diapers and use them 2 or 3 more times!I like how wide these are, they cover all the fleece so you don't have a mess on the sides of the diaper."
96714,1,"I fell in love with the sleep sheep! It is so soft an cuddly and the sounds are VERY soothing. I found myself falling asleep to the rain and whale songs along with my baby!! I have given this as a gift at 3 baby showers and 2 birthdays and it's a hit every time. You can't go wrong with this item. Smooth transaction, great price, and excellent shipping!!!!"
19267,1,This product works wonders from the infant seat to bouncer to swing. We use it everywhere.
145111,1,"I have never seen my baby so excited as when she gets in this jumperoo. She has always loved to bear weight on her legs and looks really proud of herself whenever she is standing. At about 4.5 months we put her in this jumper and she immediately went nuts, jumping and playing with all the toys. Two months later and she's still having a blast. I tried to put her in an exersaucer recently and she tried to jump for a few minutes and then got totally bored. This jumperoo is way better. Get it!"
46498,2,Do not even waste your money on this pump. It does not work at all. I tried for about 45min and got maybe a 1/2 oz. I suggest spending a little more money and investing in another pump that works.&#60;br /&#62;
25657,0,It does not hold the baby's head in one place for a long time as it showns on the picture.
150337,1,This is a great product. It washes great and fits great on my contoured changing pad. It doesn't get pilly or anything. Parents--this is the one to get.
151679,1,"I have used this product through the first and second trimester and I will continue to use this even after my baby arrives. This oil makes my skin feel magnificent from head to toe. I have one stretch mark on my belly due to weight changes pre-pregnancy and have had no new marks appear at the 6 month mark. I have gained 25 pounds... the oil is working and will update if any marks appear! The oil can go on thick, but if you let your body absorb it, the oil will not leave any residue. The smell is gentle and nice. I tried cocoa butter at first, but the smell of cocoa butter makes me sick and not to mention dollar store lotion seemed to moisturize better. I also have been using this on my face as a moisturizer after my much more expensive argan oil ran out. I am happy to say I haven't experienced any breakouts and my pores are smaller! I highly recommend this product!"
158180,1,"My 2 month old baby loves this sling. If he's fussy or I need my hands free, he loves to be in it and usually falls asleep. It is very comfortable to wear and really frees me up to use my hands. I didn't have any of the trouble reported by another reviewer that it didn't fit a smaller person. I'm 5'4&quot; and the product fit great once I tightened down the strap. This is great for shopping, walking or just around the house."
106983,1,"First and foremost, it does what it purports to do: contains diaper stink. It can smell a bit when opened to change the bag (umm, it is full of dirty diapers, afterall), but it contains the stink beautifully while closed and in use. I also spray it with Lysol and let it air dry each time I change the bag, but that's probably overkill on my part.Second, it uses ANY bags. Personally, we find Target bags (the kind they bag your stuff in at the checkout) to work very well. The handles loop over the 'tabs' inside the Champ (yes, they're still there - to answer a prior review), and then tie up quite nicely to pitch. Plus, they're completely free (a big plus in my book).There's also no 'trick' to using it. No twisting this way or that. No pushing far enough down in. No mashing down of any handle to make it work. Just drop the rolled up diaper in the opening and flip the handle, the weighted cylinder does the rest. I do recommend making sure that everything is contained (ie. wipes, etc are rolled up in the dirty diaper), but that's just my preference.BEST of all - this one's a BREEZE to open. The old one took some force to wrangle open to change the bag. Now all you need to do is push the button and lift. SO much easier, and a huge improvement to an already great diaper pail."
175132,0,"My son is 4 and half months old, too big for the sink but not ready for the adult tub. This tub is great for the inbetween stage and it allows him to splash around unlike the hard, molded infant tubs. However, I cannot get over the plastic smell. I feel like he smells like plastic after the bath. I'm even concerned that there might be chemicals leaching into his skin. I recommend it with some reservations."
12859,2,"In spite of what the reviews say and the warnings of other mothers, I bought this machine and have heard nothing but static. You have to hold the button steady to listen and all you hear is your finger trying to hold the button. The only good thing about this product is I can play music and talk to the baby. My daughter actually responded to the music and my singing. I can hear the baby better with a plain stethoscope. That's how I heard her heartbeat. BTW, I paid less than $10 for my stethoscope!!!"
144059,2,"I don't even know what to say. This pillow is so bad! It's too flat to align hips. Awkward under my head, probably too flat there. There is no stuffing where the pillow lies at my stomach so it is useless to support my belly. Quite honestly, I'm not sure what Boppy is thinking on this one.I ended up with a snoogle and LOVE it!"
79390,0,"Oh well, guess our little 12 month-old boy is flexible when it comes to color...we received one pink cup & one yellow cup instead of the blue & green cups I ordered. Haven't tried them yet as far as their spill proof-ness!"
97508,1,"I bought this for my last baby 5 years ago and it was one of the first things I purchased for my new baby. It makes the car seat, bouncy seat, any seat for your little, squishy infant much more comfortable. It has a great support under their bottoms that sit them up much straighter and more comfortably than any rolled up towel or blanket. The cushy head rests are so much more functional and soft that those horseshoe-shaped head rests. My babies have always been so comfy in these great supports I wouldn't use anything else. I always give them as gifts to new moms. Defintely worth the money."
110490,1,"Nothing keeps your kids out of your cabinets as well as these. My autistic children figured out every type of cabinet lock I had, including spring hooks. These can't be seen and work great - just don't lose the magnetic key!Works best on cupboard doors, although they do work on drawers too, but you can get into the drawers by slipping in a knife or screwdriver if you do lose the key.Directions could be clearer but once you put in one the rest go quite easy. Highly recommend for safety and convenience."
176000,1,"I purchased the baby k'tan when my daughter was 3 weeks old because she refused to ever let me put her down. I have mixed feelings about the ktan.. When baby is calm and relaxed it is easy to get them in the carrier, and it is comfortable for both of us. However if she is stiffening her legs, or upset it is impossible to get her in properly. It is a bit hot for summer use, and the way her head is held in it made me very nervous because it seemed to be more pushing and not so much supporting. I feel like once she can support her own head it will work better. I do love how many different positions you can use with it. And i also like how easy it is to get sleeping baby out of it without waking her. (Your baby WILL fall asleep in the ktan, it holds her nice and snug and lays her head right on your heart) The instructions are very clear, and there are also instructional videos on youtube for how to use it. It does take practice to get used to putting it on, so be patient! I recommend using a stuffed animal at first."
9517,0,"I was excited about this potty - very stylish, simple, cute. However, my son refuses to use it. He pushes it all over the house as if it were a car. He will only use the ""big potty."""
47739,1,I purchased this from Amazon. I received the wedge that is a two part foam with a cover that goes over it. I didn't have a problem with the zipper. My only complaint is the two parts of the foam. I don't know if it is done this way so it is easier to pack but I would have preferred it to be one piece. The split is right down the middle where my babies head goes which is kinda crazy to me but doesn't greatly impact the effectiveness. Would have been 5 star if it was one piece. So overall a decent product.
30302,0,It's what it says it is. Just a board. You don't really need this particular one. It doesn't even look like the picture. I only got it because I wanted to be SURE I had something that would work right with the monitor.
59473,1,"There wasn't any space on top of my changing table for wipes or diaper cream, this is the perfect solution. It fits a regular wipes container and diapers very well. One thing to be aware of, I have the Munchkin Warm Glow Wipes Warmer and it is too big for the wipes container space."
161090,0,this was great to feed my son fruits but it was so hard to clean I ended up having to throw away after a few uses.
11365,1,Our monitor has absolutely no static. We first tried the Safe Glow (it sucked) but this one is crystal clear upstairs and downstairs. I would defnitely recommend it!
46503,1,"This is the only bed rail I found that worked on my son's bunk bed. It was easy to install and it's easy to get into place at night. I have trouble getting it down, but my husband has no problem with it, so that might just be me."
140919,1,"NEW MOMS and WORKING MOMS...Please do not let the negative reviews keep you from purchasing this wonderful product. Choosing a breast pump that meets your individualized needs can be very challenging and researching various products can be really difficult. However, it is important that you choose a product you can trust and rely on. The Embrace pump has helped to make breastfeeding my son (now 4.5 months old) even more rewarding! Now that I'm back to work fulltime, I use this pump two to three times a day. It is very reliable, I have never had any problems with the motor, suction, or any other parts of the product. The black tote bag is very inconspicuous and the smaller totes inside help to keep everything organized. It has the most comfortable breast cups and is designed to create suction, which mimics your nursing baby (rather than pulling on the nipple, like other pumps). This pumping action is a great releif during periods of engorgement and is comfortable, even when experiencing nipple sensitivity. Now that my milk supply is well established (by nursing my son regularly) this pump works very efficiently, expressing plenty of breastmilk in no time at all. It is very discreet, the sound of the suction is quiet enough to insure privacy. However, the suction moving through the system will produce some sqeaking noises, if the parts are not put together properly. All of the parts are very durable, fit together quickly and easily, and they are dishwasher safe. It is so convenient to express milk directly into the Playtex liners or bottles, which means you don't risk having spills or wasting your breastmilk. I highly recommend this pump! Please do your own research and choose the product that provides the benefits you desire to support your breastfeeding experience!"
10540,2,These are just too thin to be used as diapers. They are also a strange shape which makes them difficult to fold to be used as diapers. I don't use them. They are just sitting in a drawer. I think I will try to use them as burp cloths as they are useless to me right now.
154422,2,"I am going to join the others who think that the new wipes are less than desirable. I could live with the fact that they are packaging 70 wipes rather than 80, IF the wipes were of good quality. But unfortunately the packaging is not the only thing that has changed. The wipes are indeed smaller and drier. But, for me the real deal killer is the smell-very chemically and pervasive. Do yourself a favor and buy an individual package before committing to a whole case."
129861,0,"This base is a must have if you are using an infant carrier in two cars. We have the latch system in both and it took us awhile to install the bases and have a secure fit. I couldn't imagine having to go through that everytime we wanted to switch cars. In fact now that they are in I won't remove them. I wish it was easier so we could go in our in-laws's cars,etc."
58058,0,"My son is now 8 months are really does enjoy his time in here. He can move the seat easily around in a circle to reach all of the toys.The Pros:* He smiles at the lights, toys and sounds each and every time, though I am now required to clap along every time he finds the ""country music"" button on the radio.* This is also a great bouncer. He really gets this sucker moving!* It's compact (in comparison to others) and it's rectangular-ish base makes a great fit in a corner.* My husband (the car lover) obviously picked this one out because it's very cute. It called out to him :o)The Cons:* There just aren't enough different things to do. He really does tire of it fairly quickly unless we sit there and play with him most of the time he's in it. If you're looking for a ""babysitter"" activity center for enough time to throw in a load of wash and pee, this might not be the right choice for you.* It's not portable at all. Everytime we try to move it to another room, the car part disconnects from the shocks and everything has to be pushed together again.All in all, my son doesn't seem to hate it but he likes the much bigger, more interesting play centers that both grandmas have a whole lot more."
1796,1,"Anything that makes a mother's life easier is worth considering. I did find the Pampers newborn product to be quite good when she was in that size, but she started blowing out of those around 8lbs (even though it says it goes to 10lbs), and Pampers just changed their snugglers to the new Dry Max which is controversial and some are saying causes chemical burns so i wanted to stay away from dry max. Unfortunately I have hundreds of these things left to use up now, but after that I think I'm back to being a different product customer. I had always heard great things about Pampers so even after having solid results from Huggies, I keep trying to go back to Pampers thinking they'll be better. Not so for my 3 month old who has some really big runny poos. Huggies Supremes are the only diapers that manage to (almost always) keep it inside. I just bought a huge case of these Baby dry diapers based on the good reviews and BAM - the first 2 big poos already blew out in all directions, up her front and out the sides creating a huge mess. I always check the ruffles and make sure the diaper is on securely since my little girl has a powerful (but cute) butt. These do seem to hold a lot of pee, or else it's just deceiving the way they get really heavy and gel like when exposed to liquid - hard to tell. They just don't do as well with runny poop, and that's my biggest peeve since it results in lots of smelly stained laundry."
55686,1,This bottle warmer helped me and my wife a lot for feeding our twins.It is easy simple and easy to use. It warmed up a milk bottle pretty fast actually but felt really long since twins were always crying for milk.If you tried to use it 3-4 times and you will know how much water you need to put for your bottle with water measuring cup. You have to clean the warmer regularly otherwise there will be some stuff in the bottle warmer.It lasted exactly 12 months for us. It only has 90 days limited warranty. Good product for the money.
28566,0,"Well the very first time I sat on it, one of the springs completely broke.It made a really loud popping sound which scared me, and I found it very insulting because I weigh 120. Fortunately, none of the other springs have broken, even with my husband sitting in it, who weighs around 170 I think. Now we've had it for about a year with no other problems. It is very comfortable and looks great in the nursery. The only aesthetic problem is, where the spring is missing, the seat cushion sags and it looks really weird and bad, but I remedied this by simply keeping my daughter's teddy bear on that spot and you can't even tell. If it weren't for the faulty spring I would have given it five stars."
65002,1,I can't take my daughter anywhere without being stopped and asked about her pacifier clip. It is by far one of my favorite items for my daughter and is now my gift of choice for expecting friends.
29968,0,"I too like these cups with the exception that the design scratches off. This started happening immediately when my daughter started using them. After about 6 months, most of the design was gone leaving just enough to make the cups look extremely worn and old. I didn't want to buy new sippy cups because they don't leak and are otherwise great cups. I eventually ended up gently rubbing a green pot scrubbing pad over them to get the remaining paint off of them. Sadly, my daughter just has plain pink and purple cups with no princesses now!"
8695,1,"This is the best booster seat. It ""grips"" easily to chairs and does not slide. We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it! It is the most durable seat too. My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition. It is soft and comfy. It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it. It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat. Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids! Definitely a must have!"
117712,1,"After trying two other jumpers -- one that was WAY too wobbly and one that was really noisy -- we ordered this one. It's been perfect.The strap is fairly long so we had to tie a knot in it, because our son is fairly tall and pretty heavy, but it's worked like a charm since. He's happy. We're happy. Good buy."
37765,1,"Very pleased with this product...our daughter had a soft bunny one when she was little and she LOVED it. It was nice not having to worry about her bonking herself on a hard binky holder as her's was soft, so I wanted to find something similar for our son. I love the long ears on this holder and am excited to use it!"
70905,1,"purchased this for when my grandbabies come to visit. They seem to really enjoy it especially when the vibrate is on. Wish the little toy that plays music played it a little longer though. Otherwise, very good product. Well made - nicely cushioned."
33657,1,This is a great gate and simple to use. The one thing that could improve it are a bit more detailed instructions for first time use. I had to compare the picture to the wording printed on the product itself to determine correct placement. Once in place though it is very secure.
76284,1,"These trays are great! I love having the lids and I use them for everything. Baby purees, breast milk, prune juice, steamed finger foods, cubed chicken, meatballs, etc. I love freezing things in these small portions because it makes lunch and dinner time easier and I can give my little one a bigger selection of foods. The lids on mine fit very snug and I haven't had any issues with them warping because I only wash the lids by hand. I do throw the trays in the dishwasher on the top shelf. I also don't leave food in the trays for longer than a few days because the lids are tight-but your food can still get freezer burn. I transfer everything into freezer bags."
86338,1,"I have used the stationary monitor since March of 2005. He's 2 1/2 years old now and recently made the switch to a twin bed. With a minor adjustment to the camera angle, we are able to observe him in his big bed. When he slept on his tummy at 3.5 moz, this monitor gave me peace as it was necessary to watch him very closely when he couldn't roll over. I've kept it on my desk and night stand, carrying it from room to room, and I plan on purchasing the portable monitor for our new baby who is arriving shortly. I spoke with Summer Infant customer support today at (800) 268-6237, to determine if it is compatible with the new hand held color monitor I will be purchasing for our new baby, and they are very helpful. They encouraged me to call them with the number on my original unit, which would allow them to determine compatibility. I purchased the portable monitor for my best friend and she has found it extremely useful over the past 4 months since her daughter was born."
123153,1,"I bought this for my 1 year old daughter mainly so she'd have a place to sleep when we visited my mother-in-law for Thanksgiving. It was a nice size, not too big and not too small. And the bottom was cushioned well enough for my daughter to rest comfortably. We had no problem getting setting it up the first night, but the second night it acted as if it didn't want to set up again. Not sure why but overrall we liked it."
72522,0,my daughter is 21 months and she love to go potty but this i must admit sure doesnt encourage her to go at all looks comfy though and durable as well
161864,0,"I did like this tub at first. I found the sling helpful as a I was very nervous bathing a newborn, However, it does leak all the time...even if the snaps are closed...I had a hard time cleaning the counter after bathing baby. (I found the bath seat feature useless: my son ,even when he was 3 month olg got squished up against it, the supprot ring did not look very comfortable and made it difficult to wash ""down there."" Collapsing for storage only saves you a few inches and is not really worth the trouble. it really gets disgusting. A simple, one piece tub would do the job as well with less hassle"
136719,0,"I would have given a higher star rating if I had not also purchased the Flutterbye Dreams Soother for the crib. There is nothing wrong with the Dreamscapes Soother - the music is lovely and the movement on the inside is nice. But, I just don't think it compares to the Flutterbye with regard to the ceiling reflection ability and the more three-dimensional objects for movement.And, just a slight drawback on the Dreamscapes in that she loves to push buttons and the ""light"" button on the top is very easy for her to push on and off, and she gets a bit frustrated when she does that and sees that the music is still on but has lost her lights."
52981,1,"I dont know what we would do if we did not have the papasan in our home. Even when we were still in the hospital, my son wanted nothing to do with sleeping in that plastic bassinette on wheels. My husband and I had to take turns holding him so he would sleep. We wondered if we would ever be able to put him down when we got home! Thanks to the papasan, we can! He loves to sleep in it! He is very fussy about where he gets some shut eye. The papasan is so cozy. We swaddle him and a blanket and place him in and its lights out! This is currently his sleeping spot at night. I place the papasan in our pack and play I have next to our bed. The elevated bassinette feature that the pack and plays have now allow him to be at bed height. We would like to transition him to his crib but when they are little you do whatever gets them to sleep. This is a step up for him because he used to only sleep in his car seat. The music is nice and peaceful and the vibrations are just enough. Battery seems to last a while because we have ours on constantly. A must have!!! Most of the other infant seats are not cozy and cradling like this one is. My husband and I wish they may an adult size version!"
34884,1,"I searched many car seats for months before buying this one, and I am very happy with my choice. To start with, it is rear facing up to 35 pounds and foward facing up to 100 pounds. The rear facing 35 pound weight limit is wonderful. You should have a child facing rear for as long as possible, so this is just an added feature. I have not used this seat foward facing, as my son is only 5 months old, but it has been great rear facing. I have an '02 Jeep Grand Cheeroke, and the seat fits in the middle of the back seat. It would not fit behind the driver or passenger seat rear facing with the recline in the proper position. If you have a small back seat, I would recomend testing this seat out before you purchase it to check the fitting. I do have a pool noodle cut up and placed underneath the seat to elevate it to the proper recline.(the pool noodle is recomended over a blanket or a towel) as for the buckel, it is not as hard as it seems. Once you do it once or twice you get the hang of it and it is very easy. You just fit the two pieces together first then snap it into the crotch strap. EASY! as for the ease of instalation, it takes a little time, and patients, but is just a easy to install as any other car seat. I do recomend getting ANY car seat inspected by a certified car seat inspector, which you can find at many fire deparments. I have to say I feel very comfertable placing my 5 month old son in this seat, and he seems to like riding in it. He falls asleep very easy and his head doesn't fall foward. This seat does have many extras that are nice to have. Like fold away arm rest, a removable pillow, a cup holder, and the best feature, straps that you don't have to rethread to change the height. I give this seat 4 stars because of it's size. I would recomend this seat to anyone looking to buy a convertable seat."
167859,0,"Great concept - the wetness liner, but not all its cracked up to be. Pull-ups are definitely easier than the pampers equivalent to apply while the child is standing in a public restroom, but as far as the wetness liner goes, my son paid no attention to it and continued to have accidents when he was too busy to go to the potty. Love the Huggies brand, but don't know if I will try this type again or not."
47135,1,"As far as strollers go, I personally don't think there is one that is just all around convenient. I think they are, by nature, bulky and cumbersome at times. That said, I think this stroller is about as good a fit for our family as possible. We travel a lot and have to often fit our luggage with a guitar and we're still able to have this stroller in the trunk with creative packing. The carrier attachment works well with our Britax Chaperone, although, it came with no instructions on usage and we've never figured out how the straps function. We've just had to place the carrier on the stroller with the seat reclined completely so that the carrier will sit deeper. With it that reclined, however, my older child can't have a super comfy ride. Our infant has recently gotten old enough to ride in the seat without her carrier, though, and that gives our son more room in the back. We've used our stroller extensively both indoor and out over all different types of terrain and haven't had any problems with it. Although, our son is older, it's still very convenient to have a seat for him to plop into when we're doing a lot of walking or if we need to get somewhere quickly. Plus, he loves playing with his sis as we walk around. The basket isn't that great as it's not easy to get to, but it's better than nothing. Most disappointing is the lack of a good cup holder for the parents."
93229,1,"I got this just before heading to travel for the holidays. It is the perfect height that he can climb in and out easily and has a slight dip in the middle (think camp chair, same idea) so he never rolls out in the middle of the night. It folds up so that it actually fit in my suitcase so I didn't get charged extra for having to check it as baggage. Crib sheets fit it perfectly and it has a removable waterproof cover 'just in case'. I absolutely adore and this will definitely be something that gets a lot of use for camping, travel and sleepovers!! Definitely reccomend."
36998,1,"First, it appears that a few of the reviews for this seat are outdated. In a May 2003 review, Consumer Reports rated this as the ONLY toddler/booster combo seat that works correctly as a booster and, therefore, the safest. The 5-point harness can tangle, but is no more prone to do so than our Britax seats, and the interlocking buckle takes getting used to, but you are always ensured both sides are securely fastened. Comfort for our 3 year-old is top notch and the harness height adjustment is simple. The base of the seat (which is not separable) is large and very stable, but you must have above-average-sized rear seats to handle it - if you have a deeper-angled or smaller rear seat (as in our other car) look elsewhere. One gripe: the upholstery is prone to small snags."
144865,1,"I have had this bather for two babies. It worked very well for my son when he was small, until he was able to sit on it. Now I use it with my daughter, she is a big baby (9lb 10 oz at birth). And it is plenty supportive enough. Works great in the tub or in a large sink. I'm not sure how well it would work for very light babies, It does have some floating properties, so it may be less stable if your baby is very light.Mrs. Meg Logan"
37149,1,"I originally bought this bag thinking of my husband, but I love it too!! We both love the design, it has a lot of storage space and is functional too. I really love the handy wipe container and changing pad in the back pocket! It's definitely durable and will put up with a lot of use! I would recommend this bag for sure!!"
81719,1,This has worked great. I even attached it to an old dresser which doubled as a changing table. It was the perfect size and has straps so that you can secure it to the dresser.
138660,1,My kids will not go to bed without these magical turtles. I have an 8 year old girl who loves it & a 3 year old boy who thinks its the greatest ever! I highly recommend this bedtime companion for all ages!
121053,2,"I was set on using cloth diapers for our first baby, and was pleased to find that the highly rated Kooshies were available at Babies 'R Us. I bought two packages of the infant sized all-in-ones, and each one unravelled or frayed during the first washing! Fortunately, I did not have a problem returning them for store credit. I purchased Bumkins all-in-ones at another online store, and have been thoroughly satisfied with them. I recommend to those who choose cloth diapers, to pay the extra $ and get Bumkins which will last. I also have found the Bumkins to be extremely absorbent and have yet to experience leaks during the 8 weeks I've been using them."
4663,0,"These diapers do not hold my breastfed baby's poop. I always end up having to change her cloths due to a leaky diaper. Also, the tabs are the only stretchy part. The side of the diaper the tab is attached to does not give at all creating a gap. The diapers seem to run on the small side as well."
107295,1,"We love the diaper champ. We were not excited about the idea of buying special bags just to toss diapers into, but wanted the odor locking power of the diaper genie. We were thrilled when we saw the diaper champ and even more thrilled once we began to use it. It is simple to use and eliminates diaper odors. It is easy to clean as well. Keeping it clean with daily bag emptying and occaisonal lysol spray will keep it oderless. Once our baby, now 4 months old, is able to get into things he won't beable to get into this trash can since the diaper champ ""locks"" securely closed. Any plastic bag works, but the tall kitchen trash bags work very well. And, since it takes regular bags you will not feel guilty about using it as a secure trash can for all of baby's room trash."
104724,1,These are so handy...bought 2 for my 3.5 yr old and 2 year old. I got tired of sippy cups. Now I can keep juice boxes in my car and have something for the kids to drink all the time.The holders work perfectly and prevent squirting.
98420,1,"I've been using this product for a bit over two months and so far have not had any real issues with it. I bought it when my baby was starting to sit up and getting too big for her old tub (the cheap blue plastic kind you put in the kitchen sink). It's not particularly portable and you do have to fill your whole bath with water, so if those will be problems for you, I think you'd have to get an inflatable tub. I personally find this much nicer than the inflatable sort because she doesn't slide around all over the place, which would also be a problem if I just put her in the big tub.One reviewer mentioned that the sides were not filled all the way with beads, but this is not actually a problem because when it's in the water, the beads sort of float up anyway. My baby does try to climb out but I don't think that has anything to do with the product. The only things I would mention is that because of the way the sides float up, it is a bit smaller than it looks at first. Also it would have been nice if there were some rubbery grips or something on the bottom as it does have a tendency to slide a bit. And something that really should be mentioned in the product description is that you are not supposed to use any sort of moisturizing soaps in it as this can increase the liklihood that it will mildew. Despite that, I've been continuing to use Burt's Bees liquid baby wash (which contains ""plant moisturizers"" or something like that) and occasionally Burt's buttermilk bath powder. I don't have any problems yet (but it's probably too soon to tell) but I can say that the tub seems to be drying out within 24 hours despite living in a damp chilly climate (but then, it's summer).UPDATE: I've had this bath now for 2&1/2 years and if I could, I would upgrade my rating to 5 stars because it's held up so well and for $25 has been so worth it. My daughter was still using her ""boat"" at 35lbs/36in though she didn't need to anymore. Then when my infant son was ready, we switched him over to it. There is room for this to sit in the bath and still have another kid sit next to it. I did eventually notice it starting to smell musty (particularly after using the Buttermilk Bath) but I just put it the washing machine. I don't use detergent becuz the 1st time I noticed a ton of suds in the washer and realized it must have soap built up in it already. I just rinse it in water and it comes out feeling a lot lighter and smelling fine. Occasionally it it's still stinky after rinsing, I'll put a bit of bleach in the wash too and that takes care of it. The only caveat is that I do have a front loader and I'd be a bit leery about putting this in a washer with an agitator- I'd hate to have it tear and get those little beads everywhere. Also there was a slight bit of padding on the bottom that came loose in a wash and is now bunched up to the side but the kids don't seem to mind. Oh, and we flip it over and use it as a pillow when it's time to wash my daughter's hair. So, all said, I still think this product is way better than any of the other options out there and would highly recommend it."
93298,2,I bought this for my grand daughter for sleeping when she came to visit. I used it about 6 times and one of the end clips is now broken. She is only 3 and weighs about 40 pounds yet this piece of junk couldn't hold up under normal use. I don't know how you can show a picture of 2 kids sitting on it and claim it is suitable for a daycare use when it fell apart so easily.
22004,2,"These bags leak pretty often from the zipper closure and only hold 5 oz. Lansinoh's bags are a lot better, have a double zipper and are a more flexible plastic. These are a pain. don't buy them."
8084,0,"...babies are MESSY. The cushion spent more time in the washing machine than on the chair! Eventually I wised up to the fact that it was easier to wipe down the chair than to keep laundering the cushion.So if you're going to get one, get two, so you'll have a spare when the first one is covered in banana mush."
91584,1,"This bag is ALOT larger than it seems in the picture. It fits comfortably across the side of my daughter's crib and I use it to put in small toys and what not for easy reach when we/ she needs them. It's not clear but the simpler ones are actually a checkered pattern, I guess you can see it if you look closely. All in all, a great idea and it serves its purpose very well. I would definitely recommend it for a nursery as a must have, where else can you put small toys for an easy reach? Maybe in the future, they will start including them in the crib bedding set like they do with the diaper stackers."
92353,0,"THis order way was out of stock, Had to cancel my order, so I cant rate or give a review."
170428,2,My 20 month old son can reach the lever and lossen the shoulder straps. He is not a geninus - any other 20 month old can do the same. I can't believe this car seat has not been recalled.
19269,2,"I bought this for my first baby, did not do anything to keep his head from flopping all over. Kept using it anyways, came in handy for the one total blow out he had. Otherwise only good for waisting money, needing readjusted alot, and needing washed."
173575,1,"Great swing, no issues with the mechanics of it, but my son was born with a headful of hair and the pillow on this swing is soft microsuede. By the time I realized that the microsuede fabric was rubbing the back of his hair off, he looked like a monk-a headful of black hair save for a 2 inch bald line around the back of his head which the pillow rubbed off. Once I realized this was happening, I simply laid a satin blanket over the swing's pillow and his hair has since begun growing back in. Would have given 5 stars except for this issue."
135213,2,"I bought this bugaboo for my newborn son because it is versatile and solid. After mounting it, I inflated the back tires with the pump provided (not an easy task, because the pump is really small): twenty minutes later, one of the tires EXPLODED. I found out that it is not an uncommon problem. I sent an email to their customer service and they did not reply in the next 24 hours. I called and a customer service representative naturally gifted with bad manners told me that they will send a replacement for the exploded tire. Delivery time: 7 business days, which basically means two weeks between the explosion and my possibility to use the stroller. Way too long for a new baby!"
93459,2,I bought this potty for my daughter and everytime she goes on it a small amount of pee is in the potty the rest is on the floor. The collection bowl doesn't fit properly. There is a big gap in the front of the potty. Plus getting the bowl off the bottom is such a struggle that I usually end up spilling the contents anyway. I am going to buy a new potty today.
171124,1,"My 2 year old daughter loves snuggling with ""Spunky"" during naps and at night. This comfy cozy is almost as long as she is tall. Very will made. Soft and really cute. I would recommend this product to others."
83689,1,"my baby had a hard time latching on. so i was pumping and feeding her through a bottle, which obviously cost a lot, since i had purchase the bottles, the bottle warmer, and the pump. someone suggested these and i tried it out and it saved our lives! she latched on right away! i no longer use it now because she latches on without it but i don't know how i would have managed without it.i gave a 4 star instead of 5 because this is less expensive at Babies R Us, otherwise, it was worth the money i paid for!"
110675,1,"my 3 month old loves his co-sleeper and so do his parents! it's comforting to know that he can sleep in his own bed safely but he's still within my arm's reach so that i can put his pacifier back in his mouth and sooth him back to sleep. also, my son had some acid reflux and before we got medicine sometimes he would wake up coughing and kind of choking on his saliva, so it was great to be right there to make sure he was always sleeping ok.HIGHLY recommended for all parents, new and experienced!"
126416,1,"These diapers, when put on properly, capture and retain the moisture better than other brands."
43072,1,"This car seat is built very well, and the latches for buckling the little one in are easy to use. It can be used front or rear facing, but in our experience it is a little large for using rear-facing. Definitely worth the purchase!! A++"
145655,1,"We bought this for my then-three month old son and haven't regretted it for a minute. He would try to jump while being held so this was the perfect solution. The flashing lights and sounds captivated him and he loved that he could bounce. Once he learned to move himself, he preferred to spin the different toys, but this jumperoo has provided hours upon hours of entertainment for him. Even now, at almost nine months, he still loves to hop around and slobber on the bee.Adjusting it to different heights isn't the easiest, but it's do-able. The easy storage feature was never really important for us, but it made traveling with it easier."
76228,1,These little trays are great! They work awesome for making 1 ounce cubes of baby food. They are easy to use and they are easy to clean. The do not take up a lot of space either. I am very pleased with this purchase.
131138,1,"I just bought this today at Target(14.99) and have started putting my 2 week old in it. He likes to be held a lot and before, I wasn't able to get anything done around the house without him crying. He sleeps very good in this carrier. I read the other reviews that said it's only good for a few months, but for 15 dollars, why not? Also, I'm still not strong enough to put the stroller in and out of the car so this makes it very easy for me to carry him in stores, etc."
92848,1,The Pink bumper was put in an antique wood crib. It looks beautiful. The pink is subtle and bright; I was so pleased with it.
144792,1,"Trying to choose a crib mattress can be a bit overwhelming, especially at large baby box stores. There are so many to choose from and the price seems to rise endlessly as you walk down the aisle. But, look no further. The Colgate Classica I crib mattress is great and affordable. My baby has been sleeping in his crib since he was 2 weeks old. This foam mattress is firm and light-weight --- the best of both worlds!"
123463,0,"I bought this portable playard for my 6m old son and other two nephews (who under 1yr.). So far, my son is fine when we put him there but my two nephews. One of them doesn't like it for some reason and cries when we put him in. Another one seems even frighten whenever we get him near the playard. Not sure the reason but I think it was the colorful bugs figures around the net walls. One other concern is the recently recalls of many toy products made in China due to dangerously high lead in paiting. As you can see from pictures, this playard's material is all painted frabic. Although, at this point I have not found this playard model on the list of recalled items. Other than that the product works as it was expected to in term of protability and safety."
7456,0,"The snap in the name snap and go seems to refer more to the marketing concept than the actual functioning of the the device. The Graco Snug Ride does not snap into place, nor rest securely in the Snap N Go stroller if you follow the instructions. We experienced similar frustrations and challenges as other reviewers to get the car seat into place. Finally we used the advice of one reviewer and improvised on the instructions--we placed the BT bar in position III and removed the snap bar altogether. This seems to actually snap in, hold more securely and work better than the positions in the instructions."
55135,1,"Fast shipping, stroller is nicer than I thought from the pictures. It is a little big and heavy but all double strollers are. I love the fact that it takes two car seats since I am having twins."
113977,1,"I bought this booster seat thinking I was still going to want a ""real"" highchair for my 18 month old. I starting using it while I shopped around for something better. Guess what? I never found anything better! I bought and returned several conventional highchairs from local stores. They were either too big, the tray was ridiculously huge, tray didn't snug up close enough (cannot overstate how important that is), etc. This booster seat is amazingly perfect."
151001,0,"Did not enjoy putting this together. Directions did not really explain ""How To"".Pictures didn't help.Was a challenge for my husband and I to put together.(To the woman who did it herself at 8 and a half months-Good for you...don't know how you did it!)Directions also gave wrong screw info as screws did not fit in some wholes they were assigned to. Difficult to keep boards aligned exactly. Will be ordering more screws from the company as we need about 4 more to align it all proper.We still have to install the drawer which I am not looking forward to!!Final point, once it is put together it looks nice, I just hope it will hold out and be sturdy enough. Way too much of a pain to return so my fingers are crossed.I wouldn't recommend this to others.Search again for better product!Happy Holidays!"
59177,2,"There is no off switch or automatic off... which in the middle of the night unpluging the thing is not always done. So we have burned ours up. I would not recommend this unless you can always remember to unplug it. However, it does heat up breast milk or formula fast."
137920,0,"This is pretty much just what I expected, except for one major flaw..The stars on the shell match the star guide as you're looking down on it, but that means when they're projected on the ceiling they are reversed! So good luck looking at the star guide and trying to identify constellations on the ceiling - very frustrating. Otherwise it's good quality and stars are projected over the whole room and the green and blue are particularly bright (amber is weak, but that's actually more restful). So the decorative aspect is great, the ""science"" not so much. Also have to say neither of my kids have sustained their excitement over this, and doesn't keep the little one in his bed, but that's our problem!"
2031,1,Love these diapers for my kids. And Amazin by far is the best deal I've found. I can't find boxes with this many in them only at the Wholesale Clubs and they typically don't have what I want. The super shipper savings makes it even more attractive and I usually have them within 2 days. Thank You!!
58942,1,"I have been using this steam sterilizer for the past 6 months and it has been a godsend! Although I was not bottle-feeding in the very beginning with my daughter, the unit was able to sterilize many other objects for me including, but not limited to: Pacifiers, cases, certain toys, breastpumping parts/accessories, bottles (of course), etc. Now that my daughter is moving up to sippy cups and the like, I can easily fit those parts in their too! My only advice is to definetly do the monthly cleaning! If you don't, then all the objects that you put into it will come out looking dirtier! And for the energy conscience, this takes less energy to power than the smaller microwaveable version. In the end, this is a great product that is well worth the money spent!"
118141,0,"We're using the bed for our 2 year old, but he hasn't slept in it overnight. It holds a todler mattress or single mattress. With the single mattress in, the sides of the bed are not high enough to hold him in if he rolls.Assembly was straight forward and easy. The bed is all plastic and for the price you pay, it's over priced in my opinion. I worked in a injection molded plastic factory for summer jobs growing up and know how easy it is to make the pieces of the bed. There are wood boards for support of the mattress that comes with it.I wouldn't buy it again if I could do it all over again. The price is too high for a bunch of plastic. Our son wasn't wowed into actually wanting to give up his crib and sleep on it either."
146777,1,If you are hunting for the ideal Diaper bag backpack then look no further! This bag rocks there is so much storage and organization for the busy parent! On top of all the storage after packing it up from unloading my other diaper bags I was concerned about my back. This thing actually protects your back it felt like almost nothing on my shoulders and back. We have multiple small children so I have to carry alot of stuff esp for outings so believe me when I say I packed this thing to the max. I have spent hundreds of dollars looking for the perfect backpack and wished that I had found this one first and not wasted all that money.
91206,1,"Great basic monitor for a great price. Easy to use, well designed, compact for travel. One receiver is all you need. While there's a little bit of white noise in the background, you can still hear baby very clearly. Works better if you plug it in, eats batteries quickly. Not for very far ranges, like if you plan to spend a lot of time in your yard. Great buy."
15051,1,We absolutely love these bottles. We have tried several different brands. Avent by far was the best for us. The bottles do not leak as long as the nipple and collar are put together when they are wet. The bottles are a little more expensive than others but definately worth the money.
48442,2,"We got this monitor based on recommendations from friends.On Sunday, Feb 17th, my baby daughter was born, so it was time to put it to the test... hmmmPros: if/when you get it to work the image quality is decent, and night vision works very well.Cons:* It only has 2 channels - one of them (channel B) didn't even work for me when the base and handset were in the same room!, and channel A worked with a lot of interruptions (lots of static once you get 20 feet away).* Once I left the baby's room I got the feed from one of my neighbors, instead of my own one - so if you live in a metro area, this one is not for you.* Another big concern is that there is no sound activated mode, so the monitor transmits all the time, you can control the video feed, but not the audio, which is far from ideal especially with a first born child, where every sound that escapes the baby has both parents up and running... (it didn't help that we also had a burst of static noise every minute or so)all in all, I was very disappointed, and will be returning the item. (which turned out to be another ordeal... to sum it up, I do not recommend to use Amazon's baby registry - especially if the baby shower is more than 30 days before baby comes, as you will not be able to return items!!!!!!)"
106893,1,"I purchased this diaper pail and after using it for the past 2 weeks, I am completely satisfied. There is absolutely zero smell from the diapers. I am using it now for my newborn with disposables and will soon begin to use it for storing dirty cloth diapers. I especially like the fact that I can use any bags or a reusable wet bag and the diaper champ is doggie-proof!"
108000,1,"I knew I was going to go back to work so I checked out information and reviews on breast pumps online. I kept seeing great comments about the Avent pump and it was so much cheaper than the electric pumps. Well, I am so glad I got it! I have been at work now for 2 months (baby is now 4 mo) and it has been working out wonderfully. I have never used an electric pump and don't see why I should. I have no trouble expressng up to 6 oz from one breast with this pump. I especially appreicate that it is quiet and easy to set up and use once you get the hang of it. It takes me about 15 minutes to set it up, express the milk and then wash it. Baby is thriving and I hope to continue breastfeeding until he is weaned."
67992,1,"Worked well for what we used it for. Was large enough to fit at least 2 umbrella strollers in. Also, was very visable, so it made it super easy to locate it on the checked baggage retrieval."
103808,0,"I got one of these for my daughter and loved it so much I bought another! The first one was perfect...fuzzy outside, soft satin feeling on the inside and the vent concept at the bottom would put my new-mom worries at rest (&#34;is she too hot/cold?&#34;). The second one I got though had all that but with a faulty zipper. We're talking almost impossible to latch/zip and when you do get it be careful trying to unzip it and not punch your baby in the face! The first one's zipper worked just fine though. I'd say buy it, but check the zipper and exchange it if you get a bad one. Alternatively you could directly contact the manufacturer...I didn't with this product but on others they've been very helpful with wonderful customer service."
69631,1,"I personally think this is a great pack n play. I did not need one that had a bassinet or anything like that, just one that was good for traveling for naptime. I have twins so I had only gotten one pack n play at first. That one was a graco one. I thought that one was ""ok"" but the bottom didnt seem really sturdy to me which was a disappointment. This one however, the bottom is GREAT and very sturdy. I wish I could buy another one of these b/c they are so much nicer and bigger than the graco one. Def a good buy!"
36647,1,This cover makes life a lot easier and germ free. I use this all the time whether at the grocery store or at a restaurant. My son looks very comfortable in it. Its worth every penny.
102801,0,"This is a wonderful diaper pail.....for about 7 months. It has definitely done it's job, up until now. At first, I bought this because it was so cheap and you didn't have to buy refills for it. I love only having to use kitchen bags. However, after these 7 months of usage, the inside clamps are broken and do not hold a bag anymore and it smells TERRIBLE!! I'm almost afraid to put diapers in it anymore because the second you open it, it stinks up the room. I've looked everywhere for the refill or replacement for the filter at the top and it is no where to be found. I am now getting rid of this diaper pail and getting one that does NOT stink up my son's room. If you only want a diaper pail for a short period of time, this is a great buy, otherwise, spend the extra money on a nicer one, it'll be worth it in the end!"
5174,1,"It took our 1 year old about a week to adjust to the new diaper. We switched from Pamper's Swaddlers. She had a rash for the first few days, but then it went away. The 7th Gen diapers is not as form fitting as Pamper's, but they absorb smell and waste just as well, if not better. We are fans of 7th Gen products, and the diapers cost about the same as Pamper's! A win win win for baby, Dad's wallet, and good ole Mother Earth."
97734,1,"I received this off of my registry and have subsequently bought two additional 3 packs of the 6 oz size as I was always washing bottles! Overall the bottles have been a good experience for us. The sleek design is great for the various diaper bags and insulated cooler bag and is easy to handle. The bottle system is easy to clean and there should be no issue of leaks provided the vented disk is inserted back correctly, which is very easy - just run your nail along the inside edge of the vented disk while pressing against the base piece to ensure a snug fit.The only issue that I have with this system is that there is no medium flow nipples. My daughter was sucking so hard and collapsing the nipple at 6 weeks with the Stage 1 nipples and it was beginning to take a long time to feed and she'd wind up frustrated and full of gas. The Stage 2 nipples are too advanced at this point and run very quickly. Before poking any holes or bailing on the systen I tried the Gerber silicon Medium flow replacement nipples (they come in a 6 pack). They fit the bottles and worked like a charm. Now baby is happy and burps like a champ again. I did try one Avent and one Playtex disposable bottle and didn't like either. Give this a try."
84566,2,This electric BP is not very good quality. I have an Avent manual pump which works much better. The suction is very poor and takes just as long if not longer than a manual pump.
165051,0,"I like pampers diapers. These hold pee very well but not so much poop. My daughter is breastfed so it is kind of watery and with the baby dry diapers, it wouldn't soak it up and would run out of the back of the diaper. They also made my daughter break out with a rash. Overall I wouldn't get these again. Go with the Pampers Swaddler diapers."
155858,2,Yeah so you don't get to choose whether you get the hand or foot and I thought I would take my chances anyway and got the foot which of couse my son isn't interested in. Waste of money
54917,0,"Although they are small, these spoons were too big for my 6-month-old's first feedings."
116818,1,"We have two bags that alternate in the cloth diaper pail - while the other is conveniently washing with the diapers it contained.This bag fits securely in the pail, contains the ""messies"" well, and is holding up well to hard use.Combined with the fact that it's eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping, and it's a value that really can't be beat..."
141146,1,"my granddaughter loves this walker..( 9 months ).pushes easily, loves the toys on the front. great product.. would def recommend to others."
157856,1,"I love this monitor! Every young infant should sleep with one of these. I think it is just as essential as crib, diapers, clothes and car seat - I think it could and has possibly already saved lives.First of all, there are false alarms. Or perhaps they are not false at all and the baby has indeed forgotten to breathe - either way, I will never have to know. That, to me, is worth the cost 100 times over! After so many seconds of no movement (10 or 20), the monitor beeps and if there continues to be no movement, an alarm goes off. It does go off in the baby's room as well but it is not loud enough to wake the baby - just loud enough to remind her to breathe. People say the alarm is extremely loud but I find it no louder than an alarm clock.The sound quality is superb. I hear as much as I want or as little as I want. We have not encountered static or interception from other monitors.Our daughter recently had a cold and the pediatrician suggested we prop up one side of her mattress with a pillow for congestion. I was upset because I thought we wouldn't be able to use the monitor but it still worked! We just tweaked the sensitivity which is adjustable, and scooted the sensor pad to the side of the crib that was not propped up. I was thrilled because the monitor came through for us in the greatest time of need. I didn't think it was possible, but I loved it even more after that.If you are even considering this product, and you must be if you're reading reviews on it, just get it. It pays for itself over and over again in the way of peace of mind. I know I wouldn't get quality sleep without it like I do now. My sleep is quality and quantity because of this monitor. It is more important than exersaucer or baby swing or play yard - it could mean your childs' life. I think SIDS would be nearly nonexistent if everyone insisted on having one of these."
2654,1,I have used this particular model of Pampers diapers for my daughter who is now 4 and now for my son. I love them. Here's why:1- They hold a lot! Never have I had a spill even over night.2- They smell very nice (When unused)3- They are thin and you can stuff just ooooone more in that pocket of your diaper bag.4- They are soft. I don't want to bash Huggies because their diapers are really good too but I find that theirs are a bit stiff.I honestly can not think of one bad thing to say about those diapers. I'm hooked.
31530,1,"works perfectly. dries quickly and like how it drains into the sink. has room for tons of bottles, tops etc..."
125912,1,We LOVE these diapers! Our 11 month old was leaking in a lot of other brands but the Huggies Snug & Dry are great!! We have shopped around and you can't beat Amazon's prices on them!
87052,1,"Have been using this for a while now and it stands the test of time, stains, spills, etc. Very happy with the ease of use and ease of cleaning. Would recommend to others that would like to keep their seats protected from the damage that can be done by little one's juice, snacks, toys, feet AND car seats."
15319,2,I'm sending this product back today!!! I thought the Recaro booster seat would be light weight and trendy. This seat was so heavy I could hardly get it out of the box.
176266,1,"For those using all disposeable diapers, you still need one dozen cloth diapers and two diaper pins. Your baby will eventually get diaper rash. If you follow the standard advice and leave the baby's diaper off, it can result in some major messes. It works much better to use a cloth diaper with no plastic pants and change him as as soon as he wets. They can also be used as burp cloths and lap pads.For those using all or part cloth diapers, these are the best among modestly priced diapers. They are very absorbant with the sponge layer, yet are not overly bulky once your baby is three months and up. They dry quickly in the drier, saving on your laundering costs. One bleaching has gotten all stains out. The only down side is a few pills on the first few washings,but this has not gotten any worse since then."
6427,1,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter as we transition from her crib to a ""big girl"" bed and I could not be happier with it. The quality is great, the colors are crisp and the whole set together is adorable. Coordinates exceptionally well with products from ""The Butterfly Grove"" (butterflies, dragonflies, etc.) that are also for sale by Amazon."
149931,1,I bought this for my one year old son for roadtrips. I works well for us. He often throws his binky but this usually catches it and keeps it within reach. We also use it for toys and puffs or cereal.
69552,1,Received as a gift from my employer while on maternity leave. It's very sturdy and attractive. I prefer it over the little porcelain piggy bank.
50739,2,"It did not help me in anyway, if you use this product, you will not be able to turn one side to another with ease, and I think everyone turns in bed frequently during pregnancy."
155637,1,"I bought this to keep in my car for my soon to be 3 year old toddlers. It has come in very handy on a number of occasions where a bathroom was not available. It works great, it's little but it does the job. Definitely recommend this product."
42779,1,"i wish I had this with all of my babies! I bought this when we were expecting our fifth child knowing I would need to be able to be hands free at times. Also, my last 2 babies had had pretty severe reflux, so I was hoping that this would be a comfy way to keep baby upright. I had another carrier that I had used but found it wasn't that comfy for baby and didn't hold baby securely enough to really be able to about any kinda of normal work.. This works from day one with the newborn hold. If baby was fussy I could slip him in and he would be sleeping in minutes. It holds the baby so snug and close to mom. Now that he's a few months old, he's out grown the newborn hold, but I just tie up the wrap a little different and he's in a position where he can be awak or lay his head down to sleep. It is a lot of fabric so when you're putting it on you have to be a little careful that you don't drag the ends on the floor, but it is not really a problem. when I'm going to the grocery store or where ever, I just put it on before I leave the house so when I get in the store if he gets fussy I can just slide him into the wrap. would tell anyone thinking about this wrap to spend the money and get it. It is worth every penny"
57740,2,"i'm glad they aren't bleached, but i'd rather have beige diapers that are stretchy & more comfortable for my little one's tush, like 7th Generation. these were too stiff and didn't fit as well. and i really don't like the sticky tabs - i prefer the stretchy velcro-like closures. not such a great bargain financially either."
182792,1,This is an excellent carseat for an equally great price. We bought two of these to use in our nanny's car for our 9-month old twins. The seats don't have a ton of padding but still look very comfortable and are easy to install and use. Very happy with this purchase!
25885,2,This gate is not a sturdy one. Would not recommend this gate to anyone. Had to buy a sturdier one.
405,0,I thought I was buying the Swaddlers when I ordered these diapers. They sometimes leak and are inferior to the Swaddlers. I loved the economy size though and would order that many again.
86315,2,"We have loved this monitor. I disregarded the hype about how video monitors make for paranoid parents and so on. It is reassuring to be able to both hear and watch my son to ensure he is ok. But after two years, the battery life is going, and big black splotches have appeared on the screen. I intended on the monitor lasting a while longer, so this is disappointing."
159251,2,"I purchased this bouncer and initially was happy with it. Then, I started to notice small cuts and scratches on my daughter's feet. At first they were so small that I wasn't sure where they were coming from. Then, she got her foot caught on the seahorse and it took a big chunk out of her ankle. I called Fisher Price to tell them about it and they said there's nothing they can do. If I want to I can ship the item back to them and when they receive it they will send me a refund check in 6 weeks for another Fisher Price toy. I told them my daughter is already over three months old and that by the time I get the refund check she will be too old for the bouncer. They said that it was my problem. Very rude. It's unfortunate that such a large company can't handle problems. I gave this item one star because my daughter did like it, just not the sharp edges on bare feet."
24822,1,"I love this baby gate! We bought it before our son was born to keep our small dog out of the nursery. It was super easy to set up (literally took minutes, the longest part was just tightening the screws in the doorway to get it sturdy). I love the way it looks and like that our dog can't knock it down like other (cheaper) gates. It's low but not enough for a toddler to climb over, although we just have a crawler right now :) -- The only difficult part is when you step down on the lever you do have to nudge your knee or hip to open the gate -- it would have been pretty neat if it automatically swung open, but I'm sure that could cause injury to children who think its a toy. All in all, I love this gate and guests who come over think its pretty awesome."
82833,1,"My sister-in-law said this thing has been a lifesaver. Little Kenzie constantly wants to be held, but this has helped to soothe her so that she can be put down more. They said she loves it!"
29557,0,"We are a Jeep driving family and my husband just had to have this walker for our daughter. Well, it is very cute but it also just got returned.The main problem is that is would not go together. The instructions were easy to follow but the pieces seems to be just a hair off. I tried to get it together and so did my husband and the slots just would not lin up.We did get it together enough for our daughter to give it a try. She played witht eh horn and the key for about two minutes and then looked at us like this is it.So the Jeep went back and we came home with a Mage Saucer...which she LOVES!"
66336,2,This carrier is the worst. I felt like I was carrying a 2 year old instead of my 2 month old! It pulled on the back of my neck as soon as I put my son in it and gave me the worst backache I have ever had. I packed it back up and returned it right away. I definitely would not recommend it.
37944,1,"Love these, especially using the subscribe and save, they are a great price! I can't use a lot of wipes due to the ingredients, so, these are perfect. I have a 6 yr old who uses them and I do also. Sure, they are smaller than adult ones, that is to be expected. They aren't so small it's an issue for me personally. I highly recommend these!"
18869,0,"This is a good chair. Security straps are plenty long enough and adjust easily. The swing tray works well and comes off easily. Clean up is great - spills wipe off with little effort. Overall, I like it and so does my 2 year old!"
27075,1,"I found the medium cradle to be too large, so I ordered the small. Others have remarked that you should order a size bigger - I did not find that true, and I love the small cradle. I purchased the Babe Mini Cradle -thru Amazon."
33892,1,"I have the electric Pump-In-Style and I prefer to use the Harmony 9 times out of 10. It's very quick to set up, easy to use and easy to clean. I think it works as well as the electric, but if you're pumping constantly throughout the day, the electric would be better for you. I'm a stay at home mom and I only need to pump occassionally (nights out away from baby, during naps to stock milk supply in freezer, etc) and I think this pump works perfectly!"
50764,2,"I am so much trouble getting into a restful sleep position at 6 months...I loved the idea of this pillow & the good reviews. I am 5'6"" & 130 pounds. I have a large belly, yet I am small in size. I am normally a side sleeper.The shape of this pillow did not fit my body correctly(because of the pre-shaped curves) If you put the head curve under your head your arm will fall asleep & I normally sleep with my arm under my head, so I don't get it. My belly was not supported & I still woke up with back pain.It takes up way too much room in a queen size bed, pushing dad 2 be almost to the floor! I still found myself wanting to flip & could not do so without constantly waking my husband.I think this pillow may work for some, yet not for me. I will just stick with multi-pillow props."
160269,2,I ordered this item thinking it would be plain ivory for my daughter. When I received it the blanket was white with blue trim. I wish the pictures or descriptions would describe the item better next time!!!!!!!!!!!
68680,1,Feels similar to store bought Swaddlers and performs as well. They are slightly bigger than Size 1 and are for babies up to 15lb. Each box consists of 3 separate packages of 68 diapers (3 x 68 = 204). Great value compared to store prices.
110190,1,"I dont know why Medela is not selling this valves with their pumps instead of the two-piece valves. This one is much better and easier to clean, and since it is a one-piece, the pump works great without loosing pressure.The package only include one valve with membrane, you may want to order two.I bought two to have them as spare valves, and now I prefer them over the ones that came with Medela Pump In Style.Great product"
146507,1,"I bought this Jumperoo 3 years ago for my now 3 year old daughter and I just purchased a second one for my new baby (since I was dumb enough to give the first one away when my daughter outgrew it). Though after a year of use with the first one, this is what I found:- Durable! After a year of constant play and the rough housing of an older sibling on it, all we broke was the rainbow part (which still held on but was a bit loose).- Very entertaining. My daughter would scream every time I took her from the toy because she loved being in it so much.- Easy to clean. Once you get the hang of unsnapping the seat (which you can toss in the wash) it's real easy to clean.- Not terrible to transport. I wish it would hold together better while in it's collapsed state, but considering the size of this toy, it wasn't terrible to take with and it fit pretty easily into my car. We took it to every family holiday and babysitter.- Sturdy base. Even with an older child pushing on it, it never once tipped or seemed unsafe.- Worth the money. My daughter played in this at least once a day for over a year. She loved it and I had a safe place for my child to play while I tossed in some laundry or grabbed a quick shower.Can't wait for our new one to arrive. I hope my new baby loves this even half as much as my daughter did."
150000,1,My 2 year old really enjoyed this on our 6 hour trip. It is very soft but still holds everything in place. It was great to sit her DVD player on and her other toys. I was very pleased with this purchase.
111042,0,"Bebe au Lait/Hooter Hiders are a really great idea and they probably work great for a lot of BFing moms/babies. I have a VERY active, inquisitive little boy though and it's been tough. I bought Chocolat (which is a really beautiful print...I love it!). The problem is that if I'm BFing in a sunny area, the light shines through the material...under the cover, the affect is like stained glass and it totally distracts my boy. (Kind of funny, I know!) The result is that he keeps coming off to look at the pretty colors and trying to get him to latch on again is like wrestling. Add a fabric cover to the mix and the result is total chaos. Instead of making me feel like I can BF more discreetly, I feel like I'm putting on a show. However, I'd have the same problem with a blanket, so at least this cover didn't fall off! I have had better success with the cover when it's been dark or dusky out, or when my son is in a more mellow, hungrier frame of mind, lol. Anyway, I think that like with all baby products, this cover will be a lifesaver for some, but not all."
68796,0,"I loved Pampers Swaddlers and only used them until my son outgrew the size 2 diapers. Then I moved him to Huggies. I tried a box of the Cruisers since I had a coupon and they irritated my son's skin. I switched back to Huggies and he is now fine. If they didn't irritate him, they would have been great diapers however - really stretchy, didn't leak, etc."
116129,1,"this highchair is assembled and waiting for my newborn to enjoy its sleek lines. this thing is beautiful. great quality and no fabric or cracks to get all crusty with baby food. even my husband, who is not into babies or their accessories, couldn't help complimenting it's design after he put it together."
48055,0,this bag is a flashy nice bag but its compartments are small and the bag is stiff. I enjoyed it for months but ultimately I needed more room.
88965,2,"Summary: these leak terribly. Today, between my two twins I had 3 leaks and now I have a huge pile of laundry. It's not a fluke - it's been this way for the last week+ that we've been using these diapers. I ordered 2 boxes of these, and the second unopened box is going back to Amazon. No more.In more detail: I have twins and from sizes NB through 3 they have been wearing Pampers Swaddlers, which were fantastic. When it came time to switch to size 4, I looked around on Amazon and only found Sensitive Swaddlers in size 4, which were much more expensive compared to regular Swaddlers. So... I thought why not try these cheaper Baby Dry ones. I mean, they are Pampers, same brand, so how different can they be? A WORLD of difference. We went from not having any leaks ever to having a rash and leaking 3 times a day. In order for the babies to stay dry, I literally have to change them every 90 minutes now, which is ridiculous. So: cliche by so true - you do get what you pay for. And in this case, I am not saving any money because I am going through the diapers at a much higher rate. I'm going back to Swaddlers, even though they are more expensive, they are worth every penny."
147205,1,"We received this baby monitor as a gift and after seeing how expensive it is, I am glad we didn't have to pay anything for it. We have been using it for 18 months now and it picks up a lot of interference: microwave, computer from the condo above us, etc. However, the night vision is excellent and the sound and picture quality is excellent. If it wasn't for the interference every once in a while, I would love it. Also, about 6 months ago it completely stopped working for no reason. I spoke with the company and I sent it back and they fixed it right away and shipped it back to me."
41960,0,"These bottles had great reviews when we began looking for BPA free bottles. They are very cute, easy to hold and easy to clean (we were use to all the parts with Dr. Brown bottles).Unfortunately they just weren't right for us. My baby had a hard time with the nipples (it's a very unusual shape)and lost patience before finishing the bottle. I think this bottle is good for breast fed babies, as they have to work to get the milk like with a breast. I really wanted to like these bottles, but ended up switching to Playtex Drop Ins."
4867,1,"These diapers hold more than your average diaper. They are great for babies or toddlers who have sensitive skin. Never a rash! Plus, they are good for the environment."
151296,1,"I normally don't review products but I absolutely love this mirror. We recently switched to a Recaro convertible car seat (rear facing), and it is too tall to put a standard mirror on the rear passenger side headrest and be visible in my rear view mirror. This mirror can be attached to the middle seat and turned towards him. I wasn't able to install the straps horizontally as per the instructions because of the shape of the headrest, but I was able to attach them vertically around the headrest and get a very snug fit. Also, the mirror is very clear and not distorted, so I can easily see my son's face. It shakes a bit on bumpy roads, but never enough to move the mirror out of position. Overall a great product."
99554,1,I have been getting these diapers since my baby was new born. My son bed stay dry for now all night. The diaper is really heavy by the morning but no concerns of leaks.
148222,1,"I bought these even though other reviews said the self-stick doesn't stick all that well. I have to say, they do start to come off every once in a while but we've got great walls that are smooth so it doesn't happen very often. And I also went to Home Depot and bought the wall paper paste for self stick borders. That took care of the problem of them peeling off. I do plan to have them up for quite a while.But I LOVE the decals and the scenes. They really do look like they are painted on. They've got a clear background and just seem to pop off the walls. These are the watercolor ones so they are muted. But I like them that way. They are adorable and with a little imagination, you can create your own 100 Acre Woods."
132453,1,"works great! I previously had a different brand which used a ""pillow"" that had to be replaced every few months. This one is much better. no pillow needed, warms faster because it only warms the wipes you need, not the entire package. The light is not very bright, but it is still nice to have. the power cord has a junction about 12 inches down the cord that lets it disconnect easily. A great feature for when your toddler trips on the cord."
82739,0,"Really like the sounds this makes but it will only stay on for 40 minutes before automatically turning off. Our newborn will start to wake up as soon as the sound goes off so I am off looking for a white noise machine that will stay on all night.Also, the sheep is not necessary, especially for a newborn. We never even put the noise maker in the sheep."
67577,1,"These are good for potty training, but they are pretty perfume-y smelling. I don't think they offer them in an unscented variety, but that would be better for me. Why risk irritating little bums with unnecessary perfumes?"
54185,1,I finally put this mobile together and in my son's crib at his 6 week mark and it was truly amazing to see his interest in it (we didn't have anything in the crib prior to assembling this). He immediately started staring at the mobile and was transfixed! It is a great product.
172730,2,I thought I purchased a great bathtub because of the shower but it was a dissapointment. My son hated the sling and the shower doesn't work properly. I'm looking for another item so that I can throw away this one.
165852,1,"Great diapers. At first glance they look flimsy and thin but these diapers are superior to all other bulky diapers. These diapers don't leak! They can absorb a great amount of liquid. Also, when the child is wearing them, it almost looks like they're not wearing a diaper at all. They're form fitting and thin."
46996,1,"People appreciate that I have a good cover-up and thay give me smiles of approval for breastfeeding my child.A nice surprise is it came with a burp cloth sewn into the corner with a pocket. It has come in handy to stash whatever may be in my hand, like my cell phone which creates a weight to help hold the corner down. Also it is nice to wipe her mouth when she is done eating"
60960,1,"The Diaper Genie has been getting a lot of &quot;bad press&quot; now that there are other diaper disposals on the market. We LOVE the Diaper Genie!! What people do not understand is that once your baby is on solid foods, you must buy the Stage 2 refills! If you buy the correct refills for your child's age, you will not have a problem. Also, you must use common sense. Make a point to wash the pail once in a while. I wash mine whenever I change the refill. You wash your toilet bowl, right?? My son has been on solid foods for months and we do not smell a thing! The Diaper Genie is right in my nursery, and there is no smell at all. It works.....buy it!"
141809,2,"I bought the gummi rail cover because my daughter was chewing on her crib. It would have worked if the product would stick to the crib. I don't know if it wouldn't stick because it had already been chewed on but the side that I really needed it to stick on (the inside)the whole thing peeled up. I kept heating it up with a hair dryer like the instructions said to get it to restick, but it wouldn't work. You are probably better off with something that clips on."
21357,1,"I'm writing this now because after getting this toy 3 and a half years ago the bungee cord on it has finally given up the ghost. This was such a great toy, I'm going to locate another cord to replace it.Our kids have loved this: they bouce on it all the time (even my 6 year old) and really develop some excellent strength and coordination.This is actually one of the top 3 best toys we've ever bought our kids."
120194,1,"If you're a working mom, you need these wipes. Instead of hauling all your pump parts to the public restroom in your office to wash, you can just sit in the privacy of your office or pumping room and quickly clean everything. Also, these are large and ""juicy"" wipes--you can use a single wipe more than once in a day to stretch the value. I just seal it in a ziplock and use the same wipe to clean up after each of the pumps I do per day at work. Using one a work day, I can make a pack last a month. So it's super easy and cost-effective."
24859,0,"We purchased this gate to go in front of our baby's bedroom door. We had to return the gate and look for a different one because we could not install the gate and close the door to the bedroom. The foot pedal is so big that it keeps the door from closing. The gate was easy to install and if you have a clear opening it is sturdy, less expensive than other options, easy to use and even our 9 year old could open it. So if purchasing just careful of where you want to install it, the foot pedal may be in the way."
11100,1,"The only reason I didn't give this product five stars was because of the color. Otherwise, it's GREAT! Easy to clean, durable, lightweight.We needed a booster seat for our 3-year-old who was tending to get out of his chair more and more frequently. In addition to giving him more height at the table (and making him more comfortable), it makes it more difficult for him to slide off of the wooden chair, thus helping him stay put at the table longer.Other users' comments helped me choose this booster over another, similar, product (which some users said wasn't as durable).We are very happy with this purchase."
149507,1,"We have been using Pampers for our baby since her birth . One time when the shipment got a little late, we had to use Huggies and my wife did not like them and ever since we stayed with Pampers."
177564,1,"Nice pump, will recommend to all moms. However it makes a funny sound when I pump and it is loud - I wish it was more quiet."
38689,0,I bought this tub because of all the great reviews on it. However it will and does get moldy or mildew. After bath time I would hang it up on the shower head and let it dry but it would never dry all the way and grew mold. I washed it and the material got gross. Then everynight since I have to swing it back and forth a million times to get as much water out as possible then hang it up. I have better things to do like play with my little girl .
128575,0,I've had these bottles for over a year now. We didn't realize right away that the ounces on the bottles are wrong. They are off. So use something else to measure. 6oz. is really 6 & 1/2. The other downfalls are they have a narrow neck for getting formula in and they leak quite a bit. We wound up using the medela non orthodontic nipples on them because we started with the medela bottles this time with the second kid but those bottles only come in tiny size. They leak less with the Medela nipple. Otherwise they clean up great & don't hold any oder. Just don't put cold milk in very hot bottle.
126185,1,We are so pleased that we are able to get these at a 30% discount with free shipping! It beats our local Sams Club price in bulk and it is delivered to our door! Can't go wrong with that!
119255,1,"I was afraid that I would mess up these decals . I can get clumsy and not pay attention to details sometimes so these decals are almost clumsy proof. As long as you can keep the decal from bending where the sticky touches another sticky part, you'll be fine. It took me 5 min max and could have been less if I didn't have to pull the sticky sides apart lol. The decals arrived In great condition, unlike other companies I've used, and the decals look like they have been painted on the wall. TIP: you'll notice that when you put George's hand on the balloons , you'll see the balloon strings show through his hand. I just peeled back is hand and cut the balloon strings that were under his hand and it looks just like the picture;) have fun!"
1810,1,"Good price but no wet indicator. It's thinner than the new diapers with wet indicator. Would have preferred to have the indicator, but for the price it's not bad"
14418,2,I bought the 3 pack 9 0z set for my twins. My babies cried every time they drank from these bottles. The bottles leaked every time I put them in the diaper bag. And the flow was very slow for even newborn babies. I have been using Dr. brown's bottles for 5 months and they work just fine.
101132,1,"This is the only diaper i use! No rush and very happy with it! There is no perfect diaper when comes to leaks, but this one holds very well and keeps my baby dry!!"
2733,0,I used the Baby Dry diapers on my daughter and ended up giving the rest to a friend of mine because they gave her a diaper rash. Even with Balmex the rash didn't go away until I switched diapers. We are fine with the Cruisers I'm guessing it's something the Baby Dry's are made of that's causing it. They also have a more plastic feel to them than the Cruisers and Huggies supreme and Ultratrim.
57047,1,"ok i know this is a ""baby"" gate type thing but i bought it for my puppy shes 14 weeks old and is very tempted to stray from the front porch so i got this to go infront of the steps and it is AWESOME!!!! its very sturdy and it opens when i need it to or want it to its completely adjustable which is great so i can always move it to another area and it will stay open when u open it so u dont have to hold it to let her off the deck i highly recommend this item for everyone its well made and sturdy and all in all a great and beautiful gate to own goes real well with wood finish to"
168221,1,"Pampers Swaddlers are the best diapers for my baby boy. Huggies are too narrow across the [...] and pull too much moisture away, leading to some nasty rashes. And the store brands don't seem to keep my boy's ""fountain"" and blow-outs contained. These are well-worth the extra $$!"
183025,0,"My crib has a wide band at the top - the way that this product is designed, I couldn't attach it to the crib.It does come with wall mounting instructions, if that's what you'd like."
49677,2,"We purchased 2 of these gates for the bottom and top of our stairs. This gate is flimsy and cheap. The locking mechanism aligns with an eye clip, and you have to ensure both the bottom metal hook sits into the eye clip while at the same time squeezing the top lock to open it then grasp around the top eye clip! Not an easy thing to do...it also does NOT secure the width of the gate, it has an open sliding design so if you over-slide it you're jamming the metal gate locks into the wall. My [...]was not able to squeeze the lock, and I also had a difficult time. I would NOT reccomend this gate, it's too chintzy and difficult for day to day life."
45600,1,"Very fun, a lot of colors and enjoyable music. My daughter loves it, specially the little mirror or watching the flowers flashing while the dong is on. Easy to clean and to put back together. Love it!"
168518,1,"We have been using Pampers swaddlers ever since our twins were born (now six months). Have been very satisfied with the product. We have had 3-4 leaks total and all of them probably our fault (overflow). Only one leak was a BM. We tried Huggies little snugglers for a 2-3 weeks and had multiple leaks in that short time.One twin had a minor diaper rash in the first few weeks but neither have had rashes since.The only thing preventing a 5-star is that some sizes include the wetness indicator stripe but most do not. While it wasn't essential, we found it very useful and would have preferred it in all sizes."
121988,1,"This stroller rides like a dream--very smooth, easy to maneuver and push. Heavy to lift? Oh yes, if you need to haul it in and out of your car, but removing one or both seats will make it a bit easier to manage. However, the quality is very good and unlike many of the other strollers out there I've ""test-driven"", for the price, you just can't get a better-made product. I love that this stroller has handles on the sides so that my toddler has a good place to hold on when walking besides me. As I live in Florida, I really appreciate that the sun visor comes down low and adjusts. The storage basket is a decent size too. Love the cup holds and a place to put your keys or cell phone. Also, Kolcraft customer service is very good. My stroller arrived with a piece of plastic that must have snapped off one of the seat belts during shipping. They promptly sent me a replacement belt."
117036,2,"I got this diaper bag mainly for my husband so he wouldn't feel silly carrying around a diaper bag, but of course I am the one using it everyday! I am sorry I bought it. It cannot stand up on its own when you set it down, and tips over constantly. The main compartment is way too small and my hand gets stuck pulling stuff out. Definitely not a wise choice if you'll be carrying lots of stuff with you. Also, the black color shows dirt! Think twice!"
68097,1,I haven't actually put all the bedding together in the crib yet but I pulled it all out of the package and looked over it. It's nice and soft and appears to be good quality. It's a very pretty set and I love the ecru color. I had such a hard time finding a plain bedding set like this at a decent price. Everything for babies has obnoxious monkeys and teddy bears all over it. I'm really happy with this crib bedding. I think it's going to look really nice.
37510,0,"I purchased this bag for sending my son's bottles to day care. Luckily, he only needs 5 bottles because there is no way this thing will fit 6 bottles - at least not the full size Dr. Brown's bottles we use. It would be an extreme stretch to fit 6 bottles in it. It works well and keeps the bottles cool though. However, the ice pack does not fit unless you only have 4 bottles inside.My main complaint is the zipper. When I received the item, the zipper was defective and only zips half-way closed. If you pull it further than that, the zipper comes off the ""tracks"". So, I can't close it all the way, but it works for my purposes of taking bottles to day care I guess."
88378,0,"It looks very nice but it is a little flimsy. It took a little over an hour to assemble but I started it w/o my husband and got frustrated. After assembled, we found a strange 'crack/split' on the right side but it didn't affect anything and you can't see it unless you look for it so we decided to keep it. We bought it to use as a changing table/dresser and it will work fine for that, it just won't last forever."
29375,1,The best powder if you want to stay dry!. Nice scent with a fine powder texture. A little goes a long way and does the job it says it does! Highly recommend!
80567,0,"I bought these Easy Ups Trainers as the transition for my 2yo (who only weighs 26lbs) but she wasn't able to pull them up and down herself and I found them difficult myself. This resulted in frustration for both her and I. They also don't have flaps for easy removal if an accident does happen, thus, the only thing to do is to rip them. Not the easiest thing when there's a big mess and you're in a department store bathroom."
180416,1,"I did not what a ""cute"" baby bag. I wanted just a normal looking bag. I like when they can go over my head to my other shoulder, otherwise I always feel like it is slipping. The strap is adjustable, perfect. The only thing is the color was much darker then I thought. It looks like a denim color in the picture but it is defiantly a Navy blue, the zippers are grey. It also seems larger then the picture. It defiantly has room for everything."
47926,1,"I have 15 month old twins and we have gates everywhere throughout the house. I bought this gate for the nursery. Its perfect, they cannot climb on it because its one solid piece of plexiglass!!! Its perfect!! Its not as easy to move wider or narrower for different different doorways but once its in position its great!! Its easy to put up and down too!"
115097,1,"I have three Sure and Secure Extra Tall gates and a twin that can climb up almost anything (fortunately her brother is more sedentary). These are the highest gates I've seen and the extra four inches make an enormous difference. They mean that my spiderbaby can't lay waste to the kitchen. Though I agree with other reviewers that the gates make a little noise (I simply wedge the gates open when not in use), I disagree that they are dislocated from the wall rather easily. If you install them properly they won't. There are also some permanent fixtures (which I haven't used) that come with the gate that you can screw into the wall that make dislocation impossible. I also love these gates because they are elegant and beautiful. All the other gates you can buy have these revolting grey/blue/peach plastic foot pads or handles that will make your hallways look cheap. I don't want to look at ugly plastic in my hallways--plastic fixtures that were designed by comittees with no aesthetic sense whatsoever. These gates are lovely and they do what they are supposed to do."
110533,1,"These locks are fantastic, but wow, what a pain to install. The directions are all but useless, so it was kind of trial and error. My husband had to drill and redrill a couple of times to get the lock in the right place so that it would work.I would recommend these locks only for cabinets/drawers where there are dangerous/harmful goods inside. It's worth it for those."
147134,0,I will not be purchasing this product again. I specifically ordered this product because I wanted a holder for the crayons. (There are enough loose objects in the house when a toddler lives there) I don't know the reason but the suction cups were actually stuck to the cardboard backing they came on and some of the paper is permanately stuck to the cups. Since they weren't sticking properly we attempted to scrub the remaining paper off the suction cups (which are super flimsy and thin) but it wouldn't budge. I can imagine in just a few weeks the crayons will have to be replaced as the stick isn't very long. Will purchase something different next time.
85423,1,not too big and a dream to sleep in. my dogs try to cuddle up into it too :)
109690,0,"(I'm Roger's partner- the mamma, really.)While this seat is clearly safe, and I love the microfiber fabric better than the plasticky alternatives, I'm not real thrilled with this seat.I've had the same problem as others with moving the handle back and forth. One side works okay, but the other side is tricky. Here's how we make it work: first, take a deep breath. Then grab the handle/button and squeeze hard without putting any pressure on the handle to move it ANY OTHER direction. AFTER you have depressed the button, THEN you can try to move the handle. The handle has to be perfectly centered before the button will be depressible and the handle therefor movable. Not an easy task if you've got a screaming baby to attend to (and taking them out with the handle up is pretty awkward-- its very easy to bump babe's head). If you look at the mechanism you can see why it doesn't work very well.The triangular handle seemed great, but the seat is still very awkward to carry. I'm probably on the weak side in terms of mothers, but even my 8.5lb newborn made this thing tough to carry. I dread carrying him around at 18lbs. Its too heavy to carry away from my body, so I end up having it banging against my leg while I awkwardly hobble around. Or I hold it sideways in front of me with two hands. However, I must admit, I haven't tried to lift other seats.Everything else works fine, and I'm sure glad its easy to adjust. The crotch buckle is annoying though in that it takes two hands to hold the two sides together before it can get inserted into the between-the-legs strap. Maybe that's typical, but I'd rather not have to do it that way."
128091,1,"So far I am pleased with this blanket. The colors are great. Not too pastel, just the right amount of vibrancy.I'll be interested to see how this flannel material holds up with more use & washing. Fearing it will pill heavily. After one wash it is not too stiff, but not too soft either, and has some very minimal change to the flannel texture.Should be a great weight for swaddling my newborn in the upcoming cold months. That is my main priority anyway."
43643,1,I love this chair! It keeps my baby from slipping too far into the water. I like that it folds up for easy storage and that the soapy water can go through so that I can rinse her easily. It drys quickly too. We use it in the sink and we spray her off with the sprayer. She loves her bath time and so do I! We look forward to it and this chair makes it so easy!
44297,0,"My son is 12 months old and this toy is supposed to grow with him but I put him in it since I am supposed to keep him immobile. So I sat him in this rocker, strapped in. He leaned over just a little bit to reach for a toy on the floor and he was on the ground with the rocker on his back like a turtle shell. Now there is a kickstand option where it won't rock and I can test it out to see that he doesn't flip in it but not now while he has the fracture! However... considering that this toy is supposed to grow with your child it surprised me that this happen. Maybe I am wrong and should have not left it in rocker mode but the product doesn't say anything that I should not put him in it the way I did. I thought it was safe. I think I have enough commen sense to judge something like this (I hope so ) but he did flip over in it. Just wanted to warn any of you that may have this toy. I was in the room with Marcelo when this happen. I didn't just leave him there but it happen so fast and unexpectedly. He was fine and nothing happen but I am supposed to keep him safe so he doesn't snap that little fracture into two. A fall like that could have done it. But he is just fine. I may test it out with the kick stands (maybe not) but if I do it will be in a couple months when he is fully healed. Actually I really don't make him sit in it at all.... since he is so mobile crawling around. I just put him in it because I'm supposed to keep him from standing up and falling.Anyway, I am ranting now but I just wanted to warn all of you about this product. I did call fisher-price and documented a formal complaint as well. They were very gracious and offered to take the product back and refund me full price but for now I said ""no thank you"" because I really loved this product and the idea that my daughter can use it too. However... I could take up their offer at any time.I recommend this toy WITH CAUTION. It is a cool toy but best for babies that are not moving much and for toddlers that can sit in it and get up from it independently. Any age in between use with caution. I have had 3 mommy friends confirm that the same has happened to them; one of them her daughter was 6 months old. Being on the floor I doubt major injury can occur but if using it for that in-between age use with the non-rocker option and pull the little legs out."
180039,1,"Great product, does the job very well. I was worried about had getting tired while pumping but it is not as hard. Super light and great to throw into the purse with you if you are away from the little one for a few feedings.Fast shipping."
62997,0,I am 8 months pregnant with twins and was desperate for anything that would make sleeping at night more comfortable. I find that this pillow gets in the way more than it helps me relax. I find myself waking up multiple times to readjust this and eventually tossing it on the floor. I do like it for curling it up and keeping my legs rested on it while sitting in bed though. And I will try to use this as a &#34;boppy&#34; like pillow when the babies arrive.
59500,1,"i do like this product but i dont think it was worth 15 dollars. if it was under 10 bucks i may have given it 5 stars. it seems a bit cheaply made. however, it does hang on the side of my changing table nicely and keeps all the little items together. i have a regular wipe container sitting on the top and it fits well. the smaller sized diapers dont fit too well because they just slide around in the little compartment and often more than one diaper pops out when you just need one, but i suppose it was made this way so you can use larger diapers as your baby gets older."
120951,1,"This gate was very easy to install in our hallway and required very little effort. The gate will automatically close and lock firmly in place. Originally we had a similar gate that was a little shorter but did not open. Everyone in the house agreed that having to climb over the gate each time we passed it was not very pleasant at all. One member of the household has arthritis in his hip and it was even more painful for him on certain days. This gate was a dream come true for all of us and has made traveling down the hallway much more pleasant. It was a little pricier than the original gate, but after using it for a week it was well worth the additional cost. I would highly recommend this gate over any others that don't open or do open but don't close behind themselves. The gate is also very durable and can be installed solidly without damaging the walls."
85081,0,"This is one of those items a husband will buy his pregnant wife in hopes of helping to ease her discomfort and hopefully allow her a good night's sleep. Unfortunately, this did not work for her 5'3"" frame on our Tempurpedic foam mattress.Here are some important things to consider when deciding to purchase this:1. Your frame size and possibly type of mattress may matter2. The top-rated review here says she was 5'8"" and another 3-star said she was 5'4"".3. This is a relatively heavy pillow, if your hip starts to hurt and you need to switch sides, it is very cumbersome to do so. I personally tried it myself and to get your knee and arm out from under it, push yourself to one side, then lift your hip onto the pillow and slip your knee and arm back under the pillow, I'm not quite sure how I would do that if I had a pregnant belly!! Now do that 8-10 times a night and holy cow, I can really empathize!4. This item is not returnable to the manufacturer, nor would you want to pay return-shipping even if it was.4a. This is not sold by Amazon directly, it's sold by a third-party (who doesn't accept returns)5. On a King Sized bed, it takes up a little less than half the width, but probably 3/4 the length. We haven't tried this on a Queen sized bed, but I'd pay close attention to the reviews that do and determine if the pillow might be too big or if your partner is a bed hog and if there will be conflicts thereafter. :-)6. I have a good habit of making the bed every morning, and this pillow simply doesn't go anywhere, heh. It looks like a life-size Domo-kun.Domo-Kun : Domo Kun Plush - 10""7. Think about this, even if we were to put it on Ebay or Craigslist, etc, who would want to buy a used body-pillow?? What family member or friend would you really feel comfortable giving a used body-pillow to? (See 4 and 4a above)My wife says 3-stars is a reasonable evaluation for this pillow and we both hope you have the best of luck! And guys, remember, Happy Wife, Happy Life!!! ;-)"
156720,1,"I have a small baby and I stocked up on diapers and wipes before her arrival. Let me tell you, Huggies wipes are the best! They are thick, the refill bags are nice and easier to carry than the boxes other brands sell. I have tried just about every wipe out there and these are the only ones I will ever buy again. The shea butter ones are nice too. Pampers and Especially for Baby (Babies R Us brand) are thin and not wet enough to clean a thing!"
181835,1,This DadGear backpack is awesome! Purchased for my son-in-law to use with my first granddaughter. It is very sturdy and manly. Great features. Would recommend highly.
21511,1,Works very well with medela bottles.It does take a little while to warm up a 5 oz bottle but it does work. Make sure it is sitting securely on the bottom to press down the button that tells the device a bottle is there. This is just like putting a miniature heating pad around a bottle.
171888,1,"I recibe this for my baby shower in pink, i love it and now my baby girl is 7 months and still good for her. I have 2 kids and my 4y old like to help me to shower his sister. I really trust the system of this bathtub it grow with your KID..LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!"
141834,2,"You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. I was wrong. These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice."
48799,1,"Got a good price through Amazon! We purchased the item to use more as a gate or blockade for our 14 month old son. We received it within 2 days with the free super saver shipping and already have it in use. We actually broke the item down in half so we have 2 90"" sections. We use one around the TV/entertainment center which is great because it allows the remotes to work through the openings and it is very effective keeping my son away from all the tempting buttons & lights. The other half we use around the Christmas tree and is just as effective keeping his curious hands off all of the lights & ornaments. We had to move the tree into the corner so the 1/2 section would enclose it but it worked out great."
83363,1,4x6 pictures fit well in the book. It's just as durable as any other book for babies. Too much drool would probably ruin pictures. Older toddlers would be able to pull the pictures out with some determination. It's cute and fun.
127268,1,"I like the crib. My last crib was about 19 years ago. They have changed - a lot.It was much easier to assemble than I expected. When my son was nearing the point that I needed to lower the mattress, I was cringing at the thought. As it turned out, my grief was all for naught. Four screws out, then back. It was done.Sturdy it seems. Some thread-lock might have been a plus. It seems the sides get a little loose now and then. A simple screw driver fixes that, but you have to be alert to the potential for things getting too loose.Lastly, there are bite marks 3/4 of the way around the front and sides. Good thing these are the rails that will go away as the crib converts into a bed.I liked it so much I got a second one for my daughter who is still in a bassinet."
166452,2,These are the worst diapers that I have ever used. They leak after only 2-3 hours of use. If someone was to give me a case of these I would give them away. I have used no name brands that have stood up better than these. Do not waste your money on these diapers!
113629,1,"We love it. It attaches securely, looks comfortable, has appealing colors, wipes clean with ease- I couldn't ask for anything more. Apparently it travels well (which is another reason we selected this product) but we haven't tested that feature. I'm confident it will work fine on the go."
23820,1,"Forget to see the model, it can only be used for 3 months. But it is still very useful.It is very soft."
170935,1,Being used in a very large home with metal studs. Reception and walkie-talkie features perform in a stellar manner without any static or loss of reception. Previously used unsecure 900mhz unit. Very happy with purchase.
123828,1,"My daughter is 6 months old, and has been using this seat since we brought her home rom the hospital. It has the best ratings from Consumer Reports, which is very important to me, but my baby also enjoys being in the seat, which makes life easy. I have to disagree with the people who gave this seat poor reviews; this seat is NOT too hot. I live in CA and we have plenty of hot days (maybe you should turn off the heater and turn on the AC, or not dress your baby too warmly), it's not too smooshed (like I said, my baby is still using it at 6 months), my baby has enough room to turn her head, the plastic piece that holds the straps together is NOT flimsy, and the straps never twist. I do agree that this seat is on the big side, but it fits in my Honda Accord just fine, and bigger means more safe. Someone complained that it won't fit behind the driver or passenger seats, but you're suppoed to have it in the middle anyway, for the safety of the baby. I also agree that it's a little heavy to carry, but it's a small price to pay for my baby's safety (I'm small at 5'2"", but I can carry it). The handle bar IS a little hard to put down when in the car, but that's too trivial to make me dislike the seat. This seat works perfectly with the stroller combo, too. All in all, this seat is SAFE, comfortable, and easy to use and I would buy it all over again."
81384,1,Bought this product based on good reviews and it is very nice and the recepient of this stroller loved it as well.
139754,0,The product arrived very timely but was missing 2 screws & a hexnut. We had to go to a local hardware store to fit the piece. The handy tool provided with the screws didn't fit all of them but we made it work. Let's hope that the quality holds up against my 2 1/2 year old!
94484,1,"Avent was the only bottle that my son would take. I had bought and registerd for all Playtex bottles, so when my son refused the Playtex bottles I was stuck with a ton of them! Do yourself a favor and register for several different brands and see which brand your baby prefers. In my case, Avent was the bottle of choice. I have read several reviews stating that Avent bottles leak and I can't say that leaky bottles have ever been a problem. If you line the nipple and ring up and don't overtighten the ring, you will not have a leak. Many people also say that Avent bottles are more expensive. Compared with Playtex bottles, which is what MOST other people use, Avent would be cheaper in the long run because you have to buy liners for the Playtex bottles and that can add up. Plus, Avent lives up to what it says because my son has never had gas or colic. From my own experience, Avent has been wonderful and I would recommend them to any mother!!!!"
169689,0,We were a little disappointed with the high chairs. They were purchased for our church. It took longer than expected to put them together because some pieces came apart and had to be repaired.
144331,1,We really like this Britax marathon car seat. We read a lot of reviews from people that had previously purchased it and based our decision to buy it on that. I can say that we have not been disappointed and it gives us comfort knowing that our daughter is in something that is safe.
127170,0,"I used to love these diapers, but recently the diapers have had a weird blue dye on them. Also the tabs break easily when trying to unfold them. Lastly the prices seem to go up almost monthly. I hope that huggies fixes these problems."
14455,1,I absolutely love these bottles. I have not had any leaking problems as others have discussed. They must be making the top too tight or not on all the way. I have tried to use other bottles but always come back to avent.
173015,0,"this car seat saver is not good for an infant car seat, so i used it for my other child's stage 2 car seat and it is not the best one out there. it does not wipe down well either. it saves the seat, but that is about it."
60135,1,"It's big it's comfy.PBA and phthalate free.Got it late so have not had the pleasure of testing the section for newbies but our 7 month old looves it! So much more space than conventional tubs easier to stand her up when needed, space to splash, space for a rubber duckie...So far no complaints. (They must have redesigned the rubber stopper that people have been complaining about as it has been very easy to get to. Though, not as easy as the first tub which the baby would empty herself mid-bath!)"
29335,1,"I particularly like this piggy bank because of its girly nature. It is small enough to fit on top of a dresser in a kids room w/o taking too much space but big enough to fit about 100 bills (that's $10,000 if it's all in $100's!). Perfect."
139260,0,"I bought this 90 days ago (I know, exactly the length of warranty ). The lights are now dimmer, I decide to replace the battery. Guess what, turtle won't light up with 3 brand new AAA. I test each with a battery tester. They are fine, and I am puzzled. I put the old batteries back in. The turtle lights up, dimly.I pull out my multi-meter, the old batteries (3 of them) measures 3 volts. So I grab another half used battery, and put it in along 2 of the OLD ones. Guess what? The turtle is bright again!So take it from me, a befuddled father, use half run down batteries for this night light. It seems to demand a voltage of 3v or slightly above. With 3 brand new AAA, 4.5v or more is too much for this baby. If you only have brand new ones, use only 2, and use a metal paper clip to bridge the last battery slot. It works. I tried."
102031,2,"I'm currently in the process of adopting my son, and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited. It never worked - it didn't matter how much water I put in the chamber, it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds. I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle. I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water, and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up.Needless to say, it's been sent back. I think I'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it's got to be easier and quicker than this thing."
168860,1,I was if'y about purchasing an open box of diapers. But I am glad that I did. Well worth saving a few bucks since diapers are expensive. Would highly recommend purchasing an open box/good condition. When receiving the package it did not look like an open box. Packaging was intact as if it were a new box. Box was a bit worn but a box is a box as long as the product is new and intact. I would buy again. :)
9227,1,"We bought 2 of these potty chairs. They were so easy to clean and stayed brand new looking that I sold both of them for 75% of their original list price when we were done with them. How cool is that? They maintained their value.Note: When potty training, don't forget to buy the character underwear. We bought Elmo Underwear with the baseball cap (sport theme) from ebay and it worked great. Trained within days!!"
40822,1,I like Pampers Cruisers because they are slimmer and seem to fit better than Huggies or other brands. My girls NEVER have leaks at night in these diapers and they don't seem to tear inside (rip and let out those absorption crystals) as often as other diapers.I was bummed when Costco quit selling Pampers because I have twins and go through a lot of diapers. I was happy to find them on Amazon--with free shipping they cost the same (and they were delivered right to my door!).
68885,1,"When my daughter was born, I bought 1 pack of every name brand and a few generics and tried them all! There was absolutely no lingering question about quality - Pampers Swaddlers (called Cruisers in larger sizes). The Absorb Away Liner cannot be matched! My baby never has diaper rash, and rarely leaks (there is the occasional explosive mess, no matter what brand). I even tried Huggies again because they're more affordable at Costco, but we had diaper rash within 24 hrs! I desperately wish they weren't so expensive, but they are seriously worth the quality and my daughter's comfort! Be sure to take advantage of the PAMPERS2 ($[...] off a $[...] purchase & free shipping). I agree with the delay in shipping - I ordered 1 size 4 and 2 size 5's. The 5's only took 2 days, but the 4's I need have no ship date yet. Be sure to order in advance!"
159021,1,"This product is definately a must have for bathtime with your baby. I have a 7 month old son, and when I was given this product, I just assumed it was a bath towel for my baby - as I have several already. Not the case. It's actually for the person giving the baby a bath to wear like a smock, so they don't get wet. It's made of very high quality terry cotton, so the absorbancy is amazing. As much splashing as my son does during bathtime, I love the fact that I now stay dry. I'm also not afraid to cuddle him close because he's cozy, while i stay dry!!"
76792,0,"It's okey, but one thing that dissatifies me is the front wheel. It is not rotatable, so it makes it harder for me to try to push it."
129241,1,The crazy wires are easy for small babies to hold onto and easy for them to fit into their mouths. The rattle is not too overwhelming or annoying. Perfect for babies 3 months+
38226,0,"We purchased this swing for our second child. It has been handy being able to move it room to room while taking care of our toddler. The baby enjoyed sitting in the swing right away, but didn't like swinging until 9 weeks. It is comfy and the baby falls right to sleep. However, the swing stops moving after 45 minutes. To get it moving again you need to turn the speed dial off and then back on. The problem with this is that the dial makes a clicking sound at every ""speed position"" and the clicking wakes up the baby, if the swing stopping hasn't already. Also the music stops playing well before the swing stops. you will also need to use a head support to keep the babies head from slumping to the side, which happens in all swings and seats in the beggining.All in all we like this swing and it folds up nicely. However it should run longer than 45 minutes or at least we should be able to turn it back on with out the clicking noise as you turn the dial."
110893,0,this toothbrush is great. Baby loves it and it really relieves his itching gums. But it is tiny very tiny it could have a longer handle. and also the materials atracts lint so you have to definatly pay attention while baby is using it. you dont want him to suck on a hairball yuks!. But other than that its great and evryone thinks is cool. Im probably gona buy it again
69846,1,"I used to use Pampers, but stopped due to a defective pack that turned me off (scratchy on the tummy!). Then I used Huggies, but they leaked at night. I avoided trying Luvs because I thought ""you get what you pay for"" in the diaper world... well, I was WRONG! Luvs are cheaper, but they are my favorite diaper! Soft, stretchy side tabs, no leaks... I'm a Luvs convert!"
122680,1,These training pants have worked great for my two and a half daughter. Disposable training pants had put potty training completly out of her mind and with these she became aware once again about using the potty. It has been effortless. They also don't leak after one pee so I can change her if she has an accident and it is not a big deal. I really recommend this product.
183324,1,"Excellent, my newborn loved it. She is growing out of it and I'm so sad to move her to a crib. She just loved this bassinet. The music put her to sleep. She liked the toys hanging from the top. The night light was useful. And the bassinet looked so pretty in her bedroom. Great product."
24538,1,"This gate is very nice. Not only is it sturdy but it looks good too! I just had my son in January and we got this gate for multiple reasons. We have two dogs that sleep in our room at night and before our son was born we kept our bedroom door shut to keep them from roaming the house. This gate allows us to keep our door open so we can hear our son in the next room while still keeping the dogs confined. I wanted a gate that you could pressure mount because we rent our house and when my son starts moving around I want to be able to move the gate to where we need it. There are only two things I'm not fond of with this gate: the pedal is kind of hard to push, and after a while the force of stepping on the pedal can work the bottom mount out of the doorway. Both are not a big deal though and I'm still glad we bought it."
46367,1,i bought this product three weeks ago for my dog and her pupies and so far i am very satisfied with it thanks.
28364,1,"I think the chair is good for what you pay for. The wood color is a little darker than I expected but it still is a nice fit for our little girls room. The back cushion is comfy and the storage pouches on the side of the arms are nice. I am still waiting to use it for late night feedings with the little one when she gets here. So, hopefully it works out great. I would recommend this chair."
59783,1,"We had a smaller tub when we brought our baby home from the hospital. It worked well for a few months, but she quickly outgrew it and bathtime came with many crying fits. The first time we bathed her in this tub she loved it. Ever since bathtime has been enjoyable for her and us! I highly recommend this tub!"
116614,1,"I bought this bag for my daughter & grandson, due date 10/2/10. But we bought the same bag (different print) for my other daughter & granddaughter. It is very stylish, and roomy, but most importantly still clean after 14 months of use. Just wipe down with a damp rag as needed. Love it!"
127448,1,"Let me start out by telling you that i bought the whole Kahlini collection and I was skeptical because of the bad reviews that said it was cheaply made. I am so impressed at how well it is actually made. The only thing I will say that may be negative is that the bottom of the drawers aren't thicker then about a half-inch, but they seem to be pretty sturdy. And the sides of the drawers are pine wood, but most dressers have that on the inside. I am not made of money especially with a little one coming, and we didnt have the money to buy a collection at a store, but I am so happy with this purchase, its going to last us a very long time! I hope this helps you out."
48515,1,This product works great in our home. It does not interfere with my wireless network. This thing is on 24 hours a day and it works just fine. The unit does get a bit warm but nothing to worry about.The only trouble I have found with this monitor is that once in a while I would need to remove the battery from its housing and put it back into place for it to charge correctly. I don't do this often but my unit requires it.I really like this product and I find it invaluable.
124657,1,"I purchased this Gate to Keep our Young, wild Great Dane out of our Family Room and off our new furniture:) I searched several different styles of gates, and keep coming back to this one. Mainly because the price seemed to be the best deal I could find for an extra wide gate. I ended up getting this one that actually screws into the wall because I heard that the other kind, when you tighten it against the wall, was then hard to open the door on the walk through part of the gate.When I recieved it, my first thought was that it looked cheap. I did want something that would look like a total eye sore since it's going to be there for a while, but it is doing the job so far. My boys ages 9 and 3 can both use the gate with no complications, they both can open and close the door of the gate without any assistance.Overall a good purchase.Amazon.com has the best deals."
31682,0,"When I first received this brush, I really liked the quality of the sponge and the fact that the plastic handle extended up to the base of the bristles. I had another brush where the handle stopped a couple inches below the bristles and the brush began to bend after a month of using it. So, while the Dr. Brown design was better, I've been using this brush for about a month now and the sponge piece has unfurled and makes it annoying to clean with. Additionally, the sponge did begin to disintegrate after a couple of weeks, which made me wonder how long the brush would last. For the money spent, I don't think I would purchase this again."
70652,0,"It's a nice, safe place to put my baby. However, she doesn't like it all that much. She doesn't care for the vibration. I've even gotten her to pull the handle that makes the cow sing (she's only 3 months). But, she doesn't like to sit there very long at all. She prefers her swing to this rocking chair. I am hoping that when she is a little bigger and can rock the chair that she might like it a little better. Also, like another reviewer had said, the cow attaches so that it's back is toward the baby. I took the velcro off and sewed it onto the other side so that my daughter could see his face.UPDATE- Now that my baby is 5 months old, she likes this rocking chair. She likes to play with the toys. Hopefully, as she gets older and learns to rock, she will like it even more."
10155,1,"We had the Baby Bjorn LITTLE potty chair that sat on the floor and used this with our son from the time he was under a year old until about a week or so ago (when he turned two). It worked great for infant potty training, but he was getting big for it and we were having trouble with messes on the floor from misguided actions.This Baby Bjorn toilet ring works great! I love how it is adjustable. We have a round toilet seat and this adjusted easily to fit perfectly! It doesn't move around at all when it is in place on the seat. I have had NO trouble with his pee spraying out and making a mess, though I can see that IF he leaned back, the potential is there (but what chair is that NOT true about? Just teach him that this is not a lounge chair!).This seat is also great as it has encouraged our son's independence. He now wants to push the stool over to the toilet and climb up himself and try to do it all by himself. This seat was a good buy and worth the money."
111619,2,"got it for my wife and she tried various techniques and found not efficient at all. For occasional l use, may be ok. But if you need to use it frequently, I suggest you may not happy with one. She used it for few days and thrown it away."
159867,0,"My only regret about this item is that I didn't buy it sooner. I loved the way it fit securely in our child's bedroom door without having to use the wall mounting (mandatory for upstairs usage). However you will not get much use out of it if your child is tall for their age. The age limit is for no older than 24 months, and just as sure as was recommended, my daughter was able to climb over this once she was sleeping in a toddler bed by her 2nd birthday. We only got a few months use out of it - if that."
181858,1,"i wasn't sure when i was registering for things if this was neccessary - but i really like it! my 2 month old daughter has been getting cleaned with the hair and body wash and it's the only one that hasn't given her a rash. i used the johnson's one on her and she broke out!also, the case that everything comes in is helpful for keeping everything all together - there's plenty of room to add things like hand towels and some toys.it's a good thing to register for if you ask me!"
28711,1,"This glider is somewhat small, but was the perfect size for my room, and me, at 5'3"". The cushions needs to be worn in, but I'm overall pleased!"
65429,1,I normally don't write any feed backs but I really wanted to let others know that this cream has done miracles for my baby's eczema-prone skin. I've tried several products including California baby but nothing has worked until I tried this one.
82961,1,Tried other potties and this one is the only one my 2 year old son will use. He asks to use it all the time! He loves how easy it is to take the collector bowl out to help empty contents into the big toilet and flush away. I didn't need to do anything to entice him to use it except put it together and place it in the bathroom and he immediately came up and sat on it. He loves that it looks like the big toilet with a lid and toilet roll holder. Great product! Just bought a 2nd one for the downstairs bathroom.
176092,0,Does it's job. It's rather thin but washable and protects the bassinet mattress. Can not keep up with big blow outs or spit ups tho. Bummer.
48187,1,"Strong, thick fabric but nice and soft to the touch. I bought this hoping it would fit the pad for my small Graco pack n'play. The sheet was about an inch too small in the width, in case you were wanting to use it for another brand bassinet too. I can make it fit with a little muscle work, giving testiment to the strong and durable seam work for the sheet. Very good quality stitching and fabric!"
154288,2,"Would not buy again! Actually going to give the rest of the packs away. Compared to the usual Huggies Natural Care, these wipes are terrible. They are thinner, smaller, and drier. I basically have to use 2 wipes at a time and then a few more. With the Huggies wipes, I use one at a time and get the job done with fewer."
22521,1,"I'm new to the Playard, pack-n-play arena, so was pleased I understood the directions and could assemble quickly. The only downside would be that they tell you to attach the bottom with the velcro tabs. I found that I could not do that once I put on the sheet. Nevertheless, the bottom has been secure so far."
81476,2,"I expected to get 5 bibs, as the picture showed 5 bibs, I received one. Ok maybe I'm an idiot. It took my 18 month old less than a week to have the ""pouch"" cracked and leaking onto his lap. I wish someone would make one of these that lasted. I purchased a similar bib at the dollar store for -a dollar- and that lasted for months, too bad they don't stock them anymore."
121275,1,"I'm very pleased with this bag. It's a perfect size (not too big, like many diaper bags)and a great chocolate brown color. It seems to be very well made too."
159466,0,"The Toy's on this jumper were alittle far away. My daughter could not reach them until she was almost 4 months old. Unlike the rainforset jumper, she could reach them at 2 1/2 months."
18252,1,My son loved this gym and we used for his first 6 months (then he started rolling over and would roll off the gym). We really like the design and the color scheme. The star on has an on/off setting and a motion sensor setting. Basically if it is on the motion sensor setting then it turns on when it senses movement from the baby or your hand. The hanging toys were durable and my son loved pulling on them.
176135,1,"We wanted a changing table that wouldn't eat up a huge amount of space, but would be sturdy, safe and easy to use. This fit the bill precisely. The changing station rests on top of the crib and secures in place with inset rails and super-strong straps. It has survived two squirrelly infants through toddler-hood. Best of all, it is at the perfect height to keep our backs from breaking.We love the Oeuf product line and this is an essential in our eyes."
142472,0,"The instructions are impossible to read and understand I suggest you look at the pictures more so than the words. It's not hard to put together just hard to understand what they are wanting you to do. It seems sturdy but I was dissapointed that it fits together under the bed with straps. I really wanted one that fit together wtih metal tubes, but with the weight of the mattress I think it seems sturdy enough for her to roll over too and not fall off. I am however concerned with the height. It's not as tall as I would have hoped, even when she is laying down."
157398,2,"I purchased this changing table for my daughter. She was expecting our first grandchild and this was something that she wanted in her baby's room. When the item came in, it had marker marks on it, chips on several pieces, and both corners that face to the front were cracked and smashed. We assambled it because our grand child was born and my daughter did not want to send it back and wait for a replacement, she just wanted the room finished. I wrote the company and sent pictures of the changing tables damage around the 10th of July 2012. I am still waiting for their response. I will not buy another piece of anything from this company."
85524,1,"Exactly what I needed to dress up the stand that I constructed for the Thomas Wooden RR for my Grand Children.Thank You,"
155589,1,"This is really compact and comes with 3 bags to get you started as well as a plastic carrying bag. We haven't used it yet, but I put the 3 bags on it and have it stored in the carry bag in the car. This is small enough for a diaper bag or under the stroller. Really great idea for potty training and young children who can't ""hold it"" for very long."
135156,1,"When we first got the stroller, it pulled to the left significantly, but we got on the phone with Tike Tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating. The stoller works great now. I have taken it running with my two girls - it is very stable and drives smoothly."
82313,1,"I was about to purchase new tubings when I read the reviews to call the 1-800 number. The rep was very nice and is shipping the new tubings for free.I had problems with the tubings falling off the connection to the pump. So I cut the tubing every month by a centimeter or so to get a more snug fit to the pump connector. Of course, that made it shorter and shorter.In addition, I was steam cleaning the tubing in the Medela steam bags every couple of months for sanitizing purposes. I asked the rep if that was a good idea and she suggested that it was not necessary. The only time she said to clean the tubings is if milk back flowed into the tubings. Otherwise the risk of the tubings getting damaged in the Medela steam bags is too great.So I'm very pleased with the service and am waiting for my replacement tubings to arrive in one week."
153051,0,"The seat is great, and installs especially well in cars with the LATCH system. My huge disappointment comes when trying to clean the fabric cover. My baby is occasionally carsick, and to remove the fabric cover from the seat one first must remove the entire seat from the car (we have ours put in by firemen so have to have that redone each time). Then you have to go behind the seat and remove the shoulder harnesses from the the adjustable bracket (which loses any adjustment specific to your kid). Next, to feed the harnesses through the fabric cover slots, you have to remove all the latches and harness guides. Now you are finally able to wrestle the tight-fitting cover from the padding and foam. Of course later on, if you re-install anything incorrectly, you compromise the safety of the seat. Plan on an hour in and out everytime your kid has an accident in the seat and you have to wash the cover!"
74544,2,"I agree with all the other bad reviews - this thing is a total waste of money. It's basically some flimsy reflective cellophane type material and two nylon straps to fasten it to the back of your headreast. There's also some weird hook kind of thing attached to the back (I think the instructions said it's for people who want to install it some alternative way) that is too narrow to hook onto anything and just gets in the way when you're just trying to use the straps. Anyway, it moves around a lot and sometimes just falls completely down the headrest. It comes with some ghetto foam wedges to presumably stabilize it, but I didn't want to use them because they looked like they would not work, and I suspected that the adhesive would ruin my leather car upholstery, which based on the other review seems like it would have. Even if it would stay in place, the cheap ""mirror"" horribly distorts everything if it is bent in the slightest. And of course, the mirror inevitably bends when you try to tighten the straps to get it to stay on the headrest. So even if you manage to get it properly positioned (which is unlikely), you won't be able to see any details about what your child is doing - asleep? awake? sucking her thumb? putting something she found on the ground in her mouth? who can say? not you, if you're using this piece of crap."
106846,2,"I bought the Diaper CHamp because the old diaper pail broke. I read some of the online reviews and decided to give it a try. It works well and uses regular trash bags - no need for expensive bags. My only problem with it is that it really does STINK!! I had to take it out of the baby's room. I am constantly spraying Lysol on it and Oust around it trying to remove the smell from the room. And I just changed the bag yesterday! I am seriously thinking of going and buying something else, or potty training early!"
151870,1,Wish I had invented this. My 2yr old grandson was completely emptying my closets. Now he cannot open the doors.
151576,0,My husband is a big cowboys fan so this seemed like a great idea for our little boy. First we tried to put it on the crib and it doesn't fit so we had to mount it on the wall (which has worked out fine) My only big complaint is that it really only plays for about 7 or 8 seconds after you wind it. The baby likes the music for the few seconds it's on but you could develop carpel tunnel winding the thing if you actually wanted to get it to play for a few minutes.
139255,1,The turtle has a hard shell and is very sturdy. The head and arms are very soft. The instructions were easy to read and follow. I appreciate that it came with a relaxing CD to listen to at bedtime. My son likes to be able to turn it on himself and change the color. I like that it stays on for 45min and turns itself off.
27404,2,"I ordered this for a pack n play just to see. It is too loose. So in case you are wanting to try this for your own pack n play! Also, I don't know why but I kind of assumed American Baby meant made in the USA. But it was made in China, FYI."
101541,1,"This looks great sitting on the counter, which is (unfortunately) where it always sits. It doesn't have a very large footprint, which is nice. I love that the brush is contained within the rack, and I haven't had any issues with mold as mentioned by other reviewers. Of course, I live in a very dry climate, so that may have something to do with it.That said, it gets 4 stars because the brush isn't awesome. It would be nice if the tip of it was more soft and spongelike; the plastic bristles don't always seem to get the bottles perfectly clean. A nipple brush would be nice as well.Overall I like this dryer, but the brush could certainly use some improvement."
61824,0,"I was disappointed in this bib. I was thinking it would be heavier, especially for the price. Great idea, but it should be cheaper for what you're getting."
143760,1,"Works really well with maxi-cosi car seat, price too much for a pair of plastic made in China. Guess this piece isn't mass produced as it could be."
126832,2,"My husband got a 36 pack of Huggies Snug & Dry for about $9 at WalMart during our trip.They leaked two nights in a row. I had to put the baby through diaper changes and it took him 30 minutes to settle back to sleep, and I could not fall back asleep on one of the nights. It was very disturbing for a whole family during our precious vacation days, all because of the leaking diapers!These are neither snug, nor dry. I discovered the Target brand diapers at one of the forums, and after trying them out, I switched completely away from brand name diapers. Target brand are softer (even compare to premium Huggies - the Snugglers -which we used for several months in the beginning), and don't leak. And they are less expensive!"
78630,1,I've used this to travel with my now 22 month old for about a year now. Definitely prefer this over buying a new car seat just for travel. It is not hard to get on and off. You have to adjust the straps on the car seat to get it tight (and then again to put the car seat back in a car) but once you've done that you can just snap it in and out easily. It is a little awkward to roll with your kid inside because if it's not on tight enough you'll have to roll the suitcase at a low angle to keep the seat from scrapping on the ground. This isn't a good choice if you'd have trouble wheeling a heavy bag but otherwise it is the best solution for not have to check a car seat or spend a lot on a special travel seat.
134613,1,This worked better for adult eczema than FIVE different doctor ordered prescription medications (steroids and antibiotics) which were tried with minimal results. It's quite amazing.
43917,2,"Check out an article below at the Chicago Tribune, most car seats are tested on sleds. These car seats were put in government crash tests for actual car crash safety tests. 31 car seats tested either flew off their bases or exceeded injury limits in a series of frontal crashes conducted by federal researchers using 2008 model year vehicles, a Tribune investigation found. The test results were never publicized, and even some infant-seat makers were unaware of their existence.[...]""The Britax Companion, which can cost twice as much as some competitors' seats, exceeded injury limits both times it was tested. The company discontinued the Companion last year, although retailers continue to sell through their inventory.""I wouldn't buy this car seat, even if it seems like a deal. The Britax Chaperone is the new model, and is supposed to have fixed any flaws that the companion had. Do your research, sometimes there are very good reasons companies discontinue a product and come out with a new version! This is one of those times!"
85516,1,Bought this as a gift for my Grandson who is an avid Thomas Fan. He was absolutely delighted with the ability to hold Thomas and place him wherever he feels on his bedroom wall.
151794,1,"This COVER IS GREAT FOR THICK PADS. But NOT SO GOOD FOR THE ONES THAT COME WITH THE CHANGING TABLES. I have a 3-4 in. thick contour changing pad upstairs and this works Great,..Because where the slits are for the restraining belt to go through fits good. This is because the pad is thick and the straps are more towards the outside edges of the table. However downstairs I only have the 1 in. pad and the location of the slits in the COVER make the straps be in the center of the table and I always to move them out of the way before I can put the baby down."
129076,1,"I lived by the bistro box with my daughter 9 years ago and I am enjoying just as much with my 6month old son. Great tips, info and recipes."
162685,1,"I have had no problems with leaks. The tub is compact, when folded, to fit under the sink. The drain works well. As far as tubs go this one works fine. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there is one tub that has a newborn sling I wish this one had."
102102,1,This is a good product. Child (5 yrs.) has been using this product with success for some time. Can't beat the price when you use the Subscribe & Save.
61245,1,"I cant fathom why people are writing bad reviews on this product. I have had it for a month and a half now,and its is ODORLESS. Whoever is having a problem with it isnt using it right. The first refill lastest one month. Please try reading the directions.Vic in L.I."
160065,1,"My husband's paternity leave ended at about 6 weeks, and he works a lot of nights, so we needed a way for me to swaddle her tightly enough (I could never seem to get it right with the regular blankets), and these were excellent!The trick to making the velcro last is to wash them seperately if you can, to avoid getting other fabrics stuck in it. I did this, and I never had a problem with them losing stickiness.We used these faithfully until the summertime, when we realized we had to give them up because they were just too hot. When we did finally try a night without them (at about 8 months) she didn't protest at all, and she is still a great sleeper to this day."
81885,2,"this pump only worked for one month, i only used it about ten days of the whole month it worked. it lost power. it took forever for me to get one ounce. it was better for me to use my own hands and i got more milk out for sure. do not waste your money on this pump, it comes out to be more expensive than the others since you have to go out to get another pump."
93703,1,I loved having all of the accessories that allowed me to pump and store breast milk directly in Avent bottles even though I didn't have an Avent Breast Pump.
130534,1,"This swing is great. Having 2 ways to swing your kid is great. Our 6 wk. old boy is not into the typical swinging motion. He loves the side to side motion.But, most importantly Dinner tastes just a little bit better when you are not funneling it down while the baby is 1/2 sleep and being cranky. This swing is the best baby-sitter we got going.As to the issues on the batteries. We are on 2.5 weeks and all is well. We use the swing probably 2 hours a day. I read all the reviews mentioning the Battery drainage. We are doing fine on our regular Alkaline batteries.Some people suggested an electric chord......... can you say ""Trip"" and then swing tumbles and then ..............lawsuit.I would say that is why there are no electric chords.Great Buy.Thanks Fisher Price."
69160,1,These are the best diapers among all the Brand.I have tried Huggies and Luvs with my first child and experienced a lot of leaks.Then i tried these and now would not use anything else.I previously bought them at Costco or Toys R Us.Then i discovered that Amazon sold them for the same price as Costco and cheaper than toys r us and whats more they are shipped free .So now i have them conveniently delivered home.Even though i chose super saver shipping i received them in less than a week
54180,1,"I have had this mobile for 2 of my children. They both loved it...and seemed facinated with it. The only problem is that the motor seems to catch on occasion and it can't get the mobile to turn all the way around. It works again if you give it a little nudge..but for that much money, I expect it to work without a hitch. It does calm the baby down and they love to look at all the diferent things going on with it."
45211,1,"WE RECEIVED THIS AS A GIFT FOR OUR 10 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS JUST 4 WEEKS OLD. I LOVED IT AND MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT, TOO!! I WAS TRUELY AMAZED AT HOW MUCH MY DAUGHTER RESPONDED TO THE MUSIC, COLORS AND SOUNDS. SHE HAD REACHED FOR THE HANGING ANIMALS AND LOVED THE SOUNDS THEY MADE WHEN SHE GRABED THEM. SHE ROLLED OVER TO SEE HERSELF IN THE MIRROR. SHE KICKED AT THE HANGING ANIMALS. THIS GYM IS INTENSE. IT IS ALSO GREAT, THE WAY IT FOLDS UP FOR EASY STORAGE AND TRAVELING. WE HAD TAKEN IT EVERYWHERE."
66016,2,"I bought these for my daughter before she was born, because the ad that I read in the parenting magazines was that is was to reduce spit-up, colic, etc. Well, everytime we used the bottle, even in her later months, she would vomit up her milk. I personally recommend the Avent bottle - the nipple is large, but they are wonderfully manufactured and developed."
118271,0,"I bought these when my lactation nursae told me I was outproducing my son, and it would be easier when I go back to work. I have a Medela pump I use at home and the Isis that I use at work. Both of which I love, and I use all of the Avent bottles. But I had to buy 3 sets of these just for the lids. It was a complete waste of money. Others have told me that the bags are much worse. I wish that they made replacement sets with the lids. My husband and I also have trouble with the way the lids set on the containers. I can not tell you how many times I wound up wearing 3 ounces of the 8 ounce container. That is when I can get the lid off, most times it takes Hercules to get these things off. I will probably not buy them again. I have tried the sealing disks and think that these are much better. I think I am going to stick with them."
118054,2,"I bought this in mind for obviously when Im out to keep bottles warm. 1st of all as soon as you mesh the button it starts to warm-a bit of a wait(okay, a long time of a wait) & then that is it! One time use. You have to re-boil it for another use. Pointless!"
149473,1,"We have 18 month old twins, and they both keep dry in Pampers. They fit both of them well, and provide excellent overnight protection. I dont believe we have ever had a leak with Pampers. While we do use other brands, I prefer Pampers. I also like the outside cover, it is almost like cloth. Some of the cheaper brands do not have a nice texture like the Pampers do, inside and out. These are my favorite."
147269,0,Love the look of it and is pretty practical. The only downside is that the changing table never lays completely flat.
54847,2,I've received this mobile for baby shower.Unfortunately I brought it back because it didn't work.:-(
181026,1,"With my first son I had a three in one entertainment system. It started as a gym, then became an exersaucer, then became a long thing a toddler could walk along. I did not like it. The gym would not stay up, The exersaucer would come apart. With my new son (now 2 months old) I decided to get something made for each stage. After looking at the various gyms I decided on this one because of the lights and sound show. My son enjoys the lights show. I try to move the butterflies around each time so he ends up with a different view. There are lots of loops to hang toys along the arches and along the edges of the play mat. If the playmat gets soiled it is fairly easy to remove from the arches to wash. The leaf in the corner makes a great crunching sound and my son loves kicking his feet on it to hear it crunch. Other reviews I had read for the product said that it did not fold up for storage, but it does fold up. You can turn the arches so that they are next to each other and then slide the whole thing behind a door or other piece of furniture."
158378,2,"I received two of these for my baby shower and they are super cute, but they only closed completely a few times and now they will not stay closed, so the wipes dry out. I'm about to throw them out because I have to put the whole thing in a big zip lock, so what's the point? I hate writing bad reviews, but I would not recommend this product."

57455,1,"Everyone parent has one item that makes life with their new baby a little easier. This was mine. Lets start with the shape, my little guy loved the way this hugged him, he would immediately start snoozing when his little butt hit this thing. It reminds me of a big papasan like hammock.The fabric is super soft and washed up like a dream (just use your noggin and don't dry it on high) The vibration was soothing but not intrusive to others in the room, the nature sounds nice and the heartbeat feature was wonderful!When he finally outgrew it (sob) I used the head hugger thingy as a nap pad in his car seat.I love this product, it is so far superior to everything else out there that I simply cannot recommend it highly enough!"
54010,1,"I got this mirror so that I could see my little girl while she is rear-facing. I don't know what I would do without it! I am a paranoid, first-time Mom, and I wanted to be able to see my daughter while driving. Every now and then, I have to drive another car and I don't have the mirror with me, I get very nervous when she gets too quiet...I need to see what she's up to!!"
183824,1,"I got this set to travel with and for daycare and I like it. The lids snap on the containers well. The only negative I've found is that the lids of the cups are not spill proof and they leak/drip a little. However, my son still likes them but sometimes the flow rate is a little quick for him since the milk comes out even when he isn't sucking."
159,0,"This is a good diaper for the most part. I do like that they are thin so they don't take up much room in the diaper bag, nor do they make my child's rear end ""puffy"". I do, however, have an issue with them overnight. I suppose my baby is a heavy wetter compared to most, or at least I'm assuming, because she wakes up soaked every morning. I change right before I lay her down and that diaper is SO full and leaking. Very unhappy with that, but I don't know what else to do."
154091,1,My daughter has very sensitive skin and the regular and even some of the sensitive skin wipes make her break out. These wipes have worked well and not caused any skin issues.
155715,0,"A little larger than I expected. It holds three cups if you fill it all the way to the brim, but effectively holds only 1.5 cups as I will explain:The clips that attach the cup to the cage are very close to the top edge, with no way to attach the bottom. The clips are horizontal, so they act as a pivot. This means it can be flipped upward a couple of inches (by a bunny-rabbit's nose for example) and a significant portion of whatever is in it will be catapulted out of the cup, through the bars, and all over about six feet of floor. The amount of food launched depends on the strength of the flip.My rabbit loved this game when he discovered it. He was apparently going for distance, trying to beat his personal best. Which is laudable. Self-improvement is so important. I, however, did not love cleaning up the mess. So, I figured out to minimize the spills (or launches) I can only fill the cup half way.The cup does have a lip around the top, to keep food or liquids from slopping over the edge while your animal is eating or drinking. If you have a polite animal, it might work better for you.Note to manufacturers: I will purchase another one of these, only if you eliminate the pivoting action. The no-spill lip is a good idea but the implementation is lacking. Also, stainless steel is much nicer than plastic, especially for rabbits."
27597,1,"My daughter is a non-stop whirlwind of motion! We bought her a Fisher Price Princess Potty and she likes it well enough because it plays music when she pees, but she discovered the button underneath to make the music play with out peeing and it lost its thrill for her. I had been oogling this potty on here for a while but just hadn't ordered it yet. Than today I walked into our local 2nd hand store and there was one sitting there all pristine and clean for $2.00!!! BARGAIN! I brought it home and washed it myself (just to KNOW it was clean) and we were out on the front porch and my daughter IMMEDIATELY wanted to use it! And she did LOL. I don't mind having it out on the front porch for her because when the lid is closed it looks NOTHING like a potty seat, she has a little play tent on the porch and when she says she has to go I just set it in there, poof! her own private outdoor potty LOL. It also will pack/travel nicely as well because of the flat top and bottom, unlike other ""shaped"" potty seats like the princess one. We travel 200miles to my parents house quite often and have always had the challenge of packing the potty seat so that it doesn't take up the limited space we have. Now, problem solved! And if she needs to go while we are on the go I can just sit it in the back of our SUV hatch area and she has a potty, this will also be great for my 6yr old as well, as there are 30-50 mile stretches in our journey with NOTHING there, just farmland and forest... who knows, maybe if Mommy has to go bad enough Mommy will use it too LOL"
98888,1,"love this diapers, they are so soft for babies and they fit very good and also the material is not hard for the babies' skin that for me is very important ."
135167,1,"Simply ... Fantastic !!!The TIKE TECH DOUBLE TROUBLE is simply a fabulous stroller. We have the single ROADSTER and now just love the double. It is so light, easy to push, and the rain cover is a great addition. This stroller is the perfect size! Not to bulky and yet, still very roomy for our children. Very easy to maneuver, and it fits through most single doors - what a pleasant surprise. With plenty of storage space, seats that individually recline and an aluminum frame, the DOUBLE TROUBLE gets 5 stars!!!!"
110456,1,"Even though the Tot Lok is a bit pricey, it's well worth the money.My daughter's room has a cabinet that has 2 doors with an open shelf space between them. We didn't want her to have access to the cabinets, as we store her nicer books in the cabinets. We tried several different methods of keeping her out of the cabinet doors. I could spend several minutes rigging up what I thought would be a kid-proof barrier, only to have my daughter get into the cabinets within minutes.I found the Tot Loks one day when we were looking at child proof products, and boy, do I wish we had found them sooner. These things are great. After a lengthy install process - my hubby is a do-it-yourself handyman type and it still took awhile to install - our daughter can no longer get into the cabinets.I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs to keep kiddos (or even pets) out of cabinets. Just don't lose the ""key"" or lock it inside the cabinet!"
155739,1,We bought this to go with our nursery and it looks very nice with the other items from the Turtle Day collection.
55114,0,"I bought this product for my 2 months and 32 months old daughters. The main reason for choosing this one over others was the option to make the rear seat completely flat. Since laying flat is best for small babies I wanted her to use the back seat. The back seat becomes completely flat as described, however you cannot have the seat reclined halfway. I other words, the kid at the back has to either sit upright or lay flat on her back. This is a big problem since most toddlers wont be comfy in any of these two positions for naps on the go. Also my little one already fusses at the back seat, because it is so much covered and she cannot see anything outside, and worse she cannot see me!The front seat also has problems, it is a little bit too short (below shoulders). This becomes a problem when my daughter falls a sleep or wants to sleep. Once agin, this seat also has very limited reclining capacity. You can recline this only like 5 degrees.I am still keeping this because there is no other double stroller that has a flat seat for the little one, at least in this price range.And of course there things I like about this stroller:- Very easy to maneuver. You can go shopping and turn easily in narrow aisles.- It rides easy, you dont feel like you are pushing a huge stroller.- You can easily walk on grass or unpaved roads.- The shaders are good, esp. the front one is very flexible."
140774,1,"I was nervous if the barrier would rattle, but hasn't at all. It was manageable to put together by myself, a bit easier with help. We got it to travel with cats in a Honda 1999 CRV and so far they haven't found an escape route yet. So far, a fantastic buy."
33039,0,I found these to really help heal my nipples but found they left a sore ring around the outer edge of my breast from pushing into skin under my bra and were not comfortable to wear. Would rec. to help heal but discontinue use asap.
159208,2,"We have two aquarium bouncers for our twin daughers. We have used these from the time we brought them home from the hospital. The two negatives that we have had is that we are constantly changing the batteries and if you have the aquarium and vibration mode on it is a bit noisy. This all would be fine as long as the babies are happy!! The main concern with the bouncer is that at 5 months are daughters began to throw themselves out of the bouncer. Since they were securely fastened in the seat they would be dangling over the side, fastened in the seat, and their head dangling to the ground. We have always been very cautious with these bouncers due to there is not any support on the sides. We had to go and buy two more bouncers for our twins because these were just too unsafe. We feel that safety is the main priority so I do NOT recommend this product. There are many bouncers out there that do provide satisfaction for your little one and provide safety. I wish that I would have returned mine in the beginning when we were concerned about the sides not having any support. I hope this review helps. We ended up having to buy four bouncers because of this and I hope this helps with your shopping decision! Good luck!! :-)"
25314,1,"This product is pretty ingenious. I put it together in about 20 minutes, it was much easier than my pack and play. There is plenty of storage space. I only wish this was in my price range when I had my first son, it would have made those long nights much more tolerable. I will say this, I got it on sale a Babies R Us, sorry amazon for about $130.00(tax included), so I am extra happy about that. All in all a great product."
17951,1,I really like this potty chair. My 3 year old uses it and it works great for him. He fits on it and it is really easy to clean. I like the way it looks and doesn't take up too much space. So far we are just using it as a potty chair but it is nice to know it has other functions as well for future use.
19349,1,You know how babies never seem to fit in their carseat when they're tiny newborns? The Snuzzler fixes that! My little girl fit so snuggly in her carseat. I felt a lot safer knowing that she wouldn't shift around in her carseat. I will definitely be using this when the next baby arrives. I buy them for baby shower gifts now!
137852,0,"I really like the Twilight Turtle but the amber lights can barely be seen on the ceiling. We have to use the green or blue. The blue is definately the brightest (not too bright) so we use it the most. The green is pretty good as well. Unfortunately, the amber is so light that we can't use it."

32003,1,"Ordered this for my niece and her new baby. She said she is very pleased with this chair. She will be able to use it for several years, and again if she has another child."
86077,0,"We had this item for a year and it worked great. We would get static, but it wasn't too bad. The picture quality was good day and night, all in all, it met our needs. Then, three nights ago, the screen image on the handheld started going in and out. The following night it was completely gone. I know about changing the channel, we tried that. It's not that, the image just isn't there. Thank goodness when we bought the monitor we also bought the 15 month protection plan and are able to get our money back. This is a fine, easy to use product, but make sure you have some sort of warranty or something on it."
170883,2,"I am so disappointed with this sheet. It feels so rough. I washed it thinking it would soften, it didn't. I would never let my baby's skin touch this fabric. Yuck."
179969,1,"I bought these replacement products in the event my original ones in the pump bag were to break, warp, tear, or otherwise become unusable. I have yet to need these, but keep them in my Avent pump bag for peace of mind. By far my most favorite breast pump of all."
150919,2,Thank goodness I read the label for this product. I wish it stated this on the package. My baby has a severe milk allergy and this product contains milk ingredients.
103045,1,I looked high and low for a bath ring at my local stores to no avail. This is exactly what I was looking for. Works great.
12507,1,"I was thinking I would have to go purchase slats after reading some of the reviews on here, however, the rails have the normal standard lip you expect on rails and then there is a piece of wood attached that hangs over far enough that the boxsprings will not fall through...SO, you do NOT need slats!!The hardware that came with it was EXACTLY what was needed and it went together in a few minutes! (note: they use the SAME bolts and barrel locks as the mini crib so if you lose something you already have it.My 2yr old LOVES his new ""big boy"" bed!!It is also VERY sturdy! I sat on his bed last night as he went to sleep in his new bed for the first time and there were no creaks etc.!"
30151,1,"I bought it for my daughter's 4th birthday and she loves it.It was easy to assemble and Amazon shipped it sooner than expected, arriving the day before her birthday.I do wish that the back of the backrest would have some form of art/drawing though."
34040,1,"This is a great bag to carry your carseat. I had been looking for something like this for my Orbit Infant carseat, but it is a different shape than most carseats, so I was concerned that this might not work. I read the reviews on Amazon, and there was some conflicting advice about this, but one reviewer had mentioned that they put it in upside down with no problems.That TOTALLY works! I just got back yesterday from air travel and I used this and it was great. I think another reviewer asked if you can also fit the Orbit car base in, and I wouldn't recommend that. The base is bulky and HEAVY, and I think that would be a problem, though I admit I didn't try it. (We used our ORbit with the seat belt option, the first time I had done that, and it worked just fine, both in my cousin's car and in the cab.)It is roomier than necessary for this carseat, but I am glad to know it should work when we move up to the toddler car seat, too."
47318,0,This growth chart is darling and has places for pictures but there is no where to write the child's height on.
75358,2,"These diapers are extremely thin, therefore the absorbency is very poor. My baby soaked himself on these each time. You can imagine the hassle of changing his clothes and bathing after each use. IT cost me more than the savings. It is worth to pay one cent more per diaper for luvs or something premium. I gave it two stars because they feel soft, quantity, shipping, and I was able to return them."
15582,2,This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area. It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry!!!! I suggest predrilling your holes!!! The hinges also won't stay on and the swinging gate doesn't line up. You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don't always have 2 hands free! By the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out!
161798,1,"This is the perfect tub, that's it, nothing to worry about here. The sling for the baby is the best thing that I have ever seen, my preemie daughter loves getting a shower in her own personal tub. She enjoys the shower massage that we have in our bathroom and she can lay in her sling while we wash her all over. After she is all clean, we fill up the tub to let her play and she is in heaven. Don't have to worry about opening and closing the tub because all you have to do is yank the ends apart and tada it's open."
116809,1,these under the nile kids training pants/ underwear are made like the way clothes quality was in 1930's-1960's! WOW--- these wash perfectly and NEVER bag at crotch...worth every penny. they wash clean everytime--- no poop or pea stains left behind. THIS I A MUST HAVE-- I bought 10 pairs in the jungle monkey style for twin boys. OH--- btw they are so soft and 100% ORGANIC made in Egypt : )
94968,0,I bought these cups for my daughter and they leaked first use. I still use them but will not be buying them again.
142798,1,"If your nipples are rubbing on the side of the 30MM flanges, then buy these, you won't regret it. This has nothing to do with large breasts, it is the nipple size that matters."
126095,0,"I have been getting these diapers for a few months, and the last pack I got (size 4) have been staining my baby's clothes. Particularly PJ's since she is in them so long. Even after I wash them the colors are still there. Great price, but I am considering stopping my subscription for this reason."
137178,0,"The plate/bowl is great. A lot wider than I expected, but has a nice no slip grip on the bottom. The spoon handles are a great size and very easy to hold, but the actual spoon part was a little bit too wide for our 15 mth old to fit in her mouth. The spoons had a good depth to scoop up food, but our daughter couldn't fit her mouth around the spoon without opening it really wide, so she ended up ""sipping"" out of the spoon instead. Otherwise, the set is well made and easy to clean. Will probably work best for an older child with a wider mouth than our little girls. But, then again, if the kid was older, then the spoon handles would be too short, 'cause right now they fit her hands perfectly."
130263,1,"My baby never cared that much for this swing, which I had bought having read all the reviews. When he was smaller, around 2-3 months old, he would occasionally fall asleep there, but I would have to remove him, because to let a baby sleep there is a disservice to him: the seat is curved, so the baby is crumped there, and you can not straighten it up. ""Ocean wonders"" and fish did not entertain him at all ( unlike Fisher Price mobile). So, I would say the swing is way overpriced."
88511,1,"So like I get this email from Amazon. ""'Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Giant Pack Size 2 172 Count' meet your expectations? Review it on Amazon.com"". Yes. You put it on and it keeps the stuff in. What more could there to be said about Pampers? They do a better job than Luvs and Huggies. They're also more expensive. The especially good thing about this Giant Pack is that it comes with more diapers than the non-Giant Pack. That means you run out of diapers less often, and that's a good thing. Nothing like having a dirty baby with nothing to change into. I say go for the giant pack! How many people read a review about diapers? Will my review be ""liked"" on Facebook? That would be really good for my self esteem."
66094,1,We introduced our baby to the bottle at three weeks. She has yet to spit up after eating from one of these bottles. Works well with the Medela breastpump. Not difficult to clean. Great product.
16979,0,"Really find this useful.Only problem is that the holes aren't wide enough (exactly the same size as the scoops in the baby formula) so filling this results in lots of wasted baby powder falling way-side. Either that or 1 has to do so very slowly. Even then, formula still goes to waste."
30401,0,I received this as a hand-me-down from a family member. It's really hard to clean the blue non-slip areas. I like the mesh. I actually ended up ditching the tub and using the mesh on a different tub that I liked more.
94419,1,This is an excellent gift for anyone who's expecting. A friend of mine registered for this for her shower and was very happy to receive it. It comes with pretty much everything a new mom needs and these Avent supplies are great quality. The bottles seal tightly and all that.
95739,1,"This is a great net, with lots of anckers to the walls it is sturdy. It fit all of my sons stuffed toys!"
19831,0,"If you want something that really sticks, take a look at the Lil' Diner Baby Diner Dish Holder instead, it's excellent."
57681,1,My son loves this super soft and cozy neck pillow! Perfect size for a 2-5 year old.He sleeps better and longer in the car now that his head doesn't slump forward.
129656,1,Our son loves this toy. It was particularly useful when he was teething as he could bite into any one of the loops with ease while getting a good grip of the toy with his little hands.
140913,1,"I work at BRU and have seen, tested, and learned about many different pumps. This is by far, the best pump on the market. I'm not saying this as a salesperson but rather an owner of this pump. And other girls working in my store who use this will agree.Advantages:1.) only pump that does NOT pull on your nipples - every other pump (including Medela) pulls at your nipples to get the milk out (ouch!)2.) works wonderfully when using One Step Breast Milk Storage Kit - transfering milk from pump to bag to bottle causes loss of nutrients with every transfer; the fact that this is a system elimates that3.) compatible with Playex Ventaire Bottles and Premium Nursers - makes it so easy and quick to put a bottle together4.) great looking tote bag with three smaller bags inside to keep items organized and clean5.) quieter than Medela pumps6.) 5 different suction settings and 5 different speeds to mimick your baby's suckling pattern7.) easy to put together - hardly had to look at instructionsDisadvantages1.) the fact that is $300 keeps some people from purchasing it - but it really is worth every pennyEven though this is a new pump on the market and most people will lean towards Medela since it's a brand that has been around for a while, Playtex put 5 years of research and development into this Embrace Double Breast Pump. They've put in the effort to create a pump that is mom-friendly. Take a chance on this new pump...you won't be disappointed."
20721,1,"My 2-year old loves this bunny and has since he was just over a year old. As a result, we now own 4 of them. Fully washable and stands up to lots of loving. Good present to buy for friends' babies as I have started to do."
138001,1,My son loves this! The best part is that we can take it anywhere so he will nap easily. This is for sure worth every penny!
37142,0,"We have an open floor plan and needed to gate off a wide space with an irritating combination of hollow walls, baseboards, and hidden wiring. After trying numerous gates, this is the only one that fits the space (when using extensions) and actually seems quite sturdy. The problem is that when we went to loosen the ""tamper proof"" hand-wheels a bit in order to adjust the gate, we couldn't do it, and the instructions weren't terribly helpful. I'm not actually sure how we'll ever get the gate down at this point. I think we'll just have to kick it down when it comes time to move."
111726,1,"We have a 1 yr old and 4yr old. Our safety 1st hands free gate is prssure mounted and we couldn't trust it to hold the weight of both boys hanging on it. We decided on this one. It looks nice and is very sturdy. However, my older son is used to his independence with the old gate but now has to call for help getting up or down the stairs (sometimes good, mostly not - esp. when he wakes before us and gets himself stuck). He can close it ok, but cannot open it. He is very frustrated with his inability to help himself, and persistently tries to open, meaning he persistently calls for help. Also, every person who has worked this has pinched fingers at one time or another. Nothing major, but a sharp pain I'm usually careful to avoid, but when I'm tired, I'm not always careful to keep my fingers at the safest distance/angle.I would recommend this gate, but be aware it is not perfect and depending on your family, may not be right for you."
93001,0,"I bought two of these for my toddler twin grandchildren. I read other reviews that stated the bar in the middle seemed uncomfortable for sleeping. I agree. With the children in a toddler stage, this cot is just OK. Once the kids get bigger, I'm not so sure. Wouldn't want them to sleep on them for more than 2-3 nights in a row. OK for gramma sleepovers. The kids love them!"
162361,0,"I agree that the aspirator does not work as well as the one you get from the hospital - but I brought home two of them from the hospital &amp; my cats have managed to hide both of them! Yeah, you can buy these items seperately, but it is sometimes nice to have extras, or all in one place."
124694,2,"I bought this gate to fit in a 48"" doorway, but we could not adjust it to fit. Other than not fitting, it seemed like a nice enough gate, although it was not very tall. I was a little concerned my active 2 year old would try to climb on top of it, but we could never install it, so I don't know if that would have been a problem or not. I think if you had a larger door opening or a smaller one, it might have fit."
143598,1,Straight review. I like it. the color is too dark though. but I can take it.
121291,0,"Adorable for baby girls room!! Overall, good quality. Keeps its tack even though I moved them around several times. My only beef is that they can tear if you are not carful pulling them off."
155994,2,"Because of the bright colors on this items, i though my daughter will love it. On the internet, it looks like the teether was small enough for a 5 and half month old child to hold. But when i got it, i was not impressed at all. It was too thick for her to grab, and will not even fit her month either. So, now it is in the box with the rest of the useless items that will never be used again"
123180,1,"This playpen is worth every penny. Our son loves to be in it all the time. We put all his toys around him and he plays with them having all the freedom to move. This playpen is a must once your child starts to move around, it is safe, you don't have to worry about them rolling off the bed.What makes this so amazing is the colors as well as the different animals on the playpen that he can play with. They all make different sounds and he rolls from side to side enjoying and discovering them all. It packs up easily and assembles even easier!!This playpen is top on our list as a must have. It is very strong and sturdy and goes up to toddler, so it lasts for a while.We would recommend it highly!!"
72398,1,I am happy with the purchase. Looks just like the picture. Assembly was easy. Brass stoppers work just fine to keep from unwanted rocking. It was however larger than I expected. My suggestion is to look at a tape measure (like I should have) before you purchase especially if you're living in an apartment.
142357,0,"These rails are a great deal for the price. A lot of the rails I was looking at were single rails and cost almost twice as much, so this was the perfect deal since I had to buy two sets. Like other reviewers mentioned, this can be tedious to put together. Once I had the first set put together, the second set was MUCH easier. The bar that fits in horizontally across the bottom of the rail is tough to put in. It took quite a bit of manuevering to get it in position, but at least I know it's definitely not going anywhere! I really do appreciate the hide away feature, since it will make changing sheets much easier and will allow guests to sleep in the beds without feeling like a toddler :) My only complaint is that the rails that fit in between the mattress and the boxspring are very thick. We had quite a big gap between the mattress and boxspring and I was worried that it was going to damage the bed springs. We just purchased the mattresses, so maybe I'm just overreacting. We ended up putting a few thick text books under the mattress (at the foot and head) so that the pressure was more even. Since my kids are both under 4, I don't imagine they could do much damage, but we have guests over quite a bit and I know I won't always have a chance to remove the rails. In the meantime, the books seem to do the trick and make the mattress quite a bit more even (you definitely couldn't feel the uneveness, I just knew it was there)."
26556,1,"I have read the reviews of others and I would have to disagree. I love this bassinet!!! My daughter is 3 months old. I registered for this bassinet after seeing it in the store. It was the nicest one there and I loved the wood. The storage area is great. I had a C-section, so having the storage area allowed me to store diapers, wipes, bisb, clothes, etc. for my daughter, and have everything right at my finger tips. The pad that comes with it is a bit thin. My mother-in-law purchased a separate bassinet pad, which then allowed me to use standard bassinet sheets. A standard bassinet mattress/pad does fit in the bassinet. When the bassinet is in the locked position it only swings maybe 1/2 inch if that! I never had a problem with it tilting as describe in on of the other reviews. The music is not great,but the music is great on any of the bassinets with that feature."
68212,1,"The NoJo Jungle Babies nursery theme is perfect for a baby boy's room, and the wall hangings help pull it all together. The bedding was passed to my friend, who is expecting her first grandson in a couple of months and the wall hangings were something new. The NoJo line is awesome! Whether you are having a boy or girl they have lots of amazing choices and prices are very reasonable."
151243,2,"The designers of this stroller were not thinking when they designed the older child to sit in the front. Not only does this make it IMPOSSIBLE to steer, it will also not go over bumps over 1/64th of an inch high. (i.e., cracks in the sidewalk.) It needs more room than a semi to turn, and forget doing a u-turn with it. The handle bar is not adjustable, the parent tray does not stay on, the back seat tray is too narrow with no cup holder, the front seat footrest is WAY too short for my 1 year old. The back sunroof doesn't stay on, and both are so short that my toddler can't sit in either seat and use the sunshades. The only way to access the storage bag is to take off the front seat. You have to brake each back wheel separately, and when the back seat is reclined, your knees hit it every step. The stroller itself is very heavy, which is part of the reason it is so hard to maneuver.The only positive things I can truthfully write about this stroller is that the front seat IS easy to remove. It CAN fold up to a surprisingly compact bundle, but it takes a lot of work to do so. (removing the sunshades & snack trays etc.) Opening it is relatively easy, but certainly not a one-handed operation."
10184,1,I bought this for my kids as part of their training to transition to a normal toilet. They used to get worried of falling into a adult toilet (some reason refused to use the kiddie pot - trying to ape parents?). this worked wonderfully and they enjoy using it as it makes them feel 'big' like an adult. There is a an adjustment screw at the rear of the seat to allow it to fit snuggly to any shape of the toilet seat & prevent it from slipping. Thus quite useful for us.Now if it could also clean the bums as well...haha
10132,1,"I originally bought this potty because my oldest child's potty trainer was too big for my toddler, which scared her. I was gritting my teeth paying $[...] for a seat, but I told myself I could use our other potty seat (with Dora characters) for car trips or something. Forget it! Now that we've been using the Bjorn for a month, that other seat is going in the trash and if we need another seat, we'll buy a Bjorn again. Our old seat was always filthy and somehow managed to be dripping when you pulled it off the seat. The Bjorn potty is well designed and is not messy at all. I like the handle, so you can pull it off the potty without touching the seat. However, I can't imagine trying to hang this seat. It is not flat on the bottom at all."
151930,1,"We looked at Babys-r-us and found nothing like this. For the price I thought why not? Now I could not imagine having a toddler without these simple and completely useful little door locks. No hardware, no screws , nothing permanent. It just slides onto the top of the door and does the job."
40059,1,"This product is not very expensive but supports quite a few sounds. Unlike others I have researched this one also gives you the ability to combine 2 selected sounds or a random combination of sounds, which makes it more interesting. It has basic volume control and on/off switch and a 60min timer mode that is helpful to turn off, especially if running on batteries. Missing features in addition that would be nice to have would be to be able to set the timer minutes before shutoff, and alarm features that could wake you up to the nature sounds. It is for babies but adults can enjoy the sounds too. The volume could be louder too, especially if in areas with ambient sound, but is adequate for our needs."
142212,0,"Over the course of three children we have had FIVE carriers: Two slings, a Baby Bjorn, a Snugli and the Ergo Baby.The Bjorn is definitely the best looking and easiest to use. The clips and connectors are very intuitive and it's easy to get smaller infants into it.My big complaint is that when the kids get larger (or if you wear it for more than 20 minutes at a time) it really starts to kill your back. This is because the design keeps all the weight on your shoulders. It's like wearing a backpack BACKWARDS!The ""Active"" version has wider straps and a which provide additional support for a small improvement over the ""Original,"" but it still puts all the weight on your shoulders, pulling them forward. The additional strap is still too high to put the weight on your hips.If you backpack, you know what I'm talking about. A lightweight daypack is fine for lugging 20 lbs of textbooks from class to class, but if you want to be able to hike for an hour with 40 lbs you have to shift the weight from your shoulders to your hips.If you only plan to use this when grocery shopping and think you'll give it up when they're 6 months old, this might be for you. If you think you might want to go to the park and hang out, or use it even when the kid starts to crawl, then the Ergo Baby is probably more your speed.p.s. this is coming from a guy who is 6', 180# and fit. My wife is smaller and far more critical of the ergonomics of this carrier.If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!"
150009,1,"This tray is great for keeping small toys and snacks in front of my toddler while in the car. I could see how it wouldn't be the best for coloring because it isn't very stiff, but it is great for keeping the toys, snacks and drinks within reach of my daughter. I would definitely recommend it."
127908,0,"My first bottle brush was ""The First Years Bottle Nipple Brush"" but that broke after a few months and it was time to get a new brush anyway so I decided to get this one since it got better overall reviews. Well... it must be hard to make a good bottle brush... it's not terrible but because the brush is round with stiff bristles, it doesn't clean the bottom of the bottle well so now the insides of my bottles have a ring along the bottom edge that can't get cleaned. Guess it's time again to search for another bottle brush!"
83828,0,"Overall this does the job, but it's not perfect.Pros:1. Good size2. Easy to cleanCons:1. Suction cups don't stick well to our wooden table2. Crumb catcher is a nice idea, but became a toy on day 2 for our 11-month-old - we cut it off.Again, overall it does the job. Our daughter does try to fold it up and pull it off the table, but at least 3 of the suction cups work relatively well so she can't get it completely off and I'd rather deal with that than whole dishes of food hitting the floor. My husband loves the disposable place mats that I got to take to restaurants better because they tape down completely on all four sides, but they're a little pricey to use for every meal so this works."
130899,1,"my two month old LOVES this swing, and therefore so do I. She is in it right now sleeping, and I even turned the swing off. In the last couple of weeks she has grown very fond of the mobile too. We purchased it after having a horrible first two weeks. For the first few weeks we had the swing, I would swaddle her, place her in the swing on full, and turn the radio on static in the room very loud. She would go to sleep almost instantly. In the last few weeks, we have stopped the swaddling during the day, but she still goes to sleep in this swing when it is her nap time. The cushions are very cozy for her and the shape of the seat is good as well. It was worth the money if it had only worked for one week. She prefers the side to side rocking motion."
146095,1,"This is the fourth bouncer/swing type of unit that we have purchased and it is by far our favorite. We had a chair bouncer that vibrated, a swing, and a jumper that hung from the door. They all served their purpose, but our little lady just wasn't that into any of them. I know that by the time a baby is ready for a jumperoo they are also developed enough that they can sit on their own for longer periods of time but I'm still amazed at how long our daughter will sit bouncing in this thing. She seems to love the music and the toys and we also can attach other toys to it using links. I like that this can be put anywhere so I can have her in it while I'm folding laundry in her room and then later in the kitchen while I make dinner. Also, it doesn't have wheels, which seems to be safer. The fact that it is stationary does not bother her. This is a really great option for occupying your little one while you get dinner ready, do a little cleaning, or just to answer the door."
48674,1,This gate successfully serves its purpose. We got a 3 month old puppy and needed to protect some areas of our house. We love that fact that you can dismantle it into sections. We also take it to other homes when we visit family and friends. In the future we plan on using it as a baby gate as well. It is a multi-purpose gate and works really well!
63341,1,"I got this for my son at 3 months, he wasnt very interested. He hates tummy time so i thought this would help. It didnt, but now at 5 months he looves this toy, he sits on the edge and hits the mat to move the toys inside.:) Im very surprised its still intact , since i had family over for a week and this toy went through alot with those rough kids, but thankfully its still as goid as new...and my son can hopefully enjoy it for a few more months.Update.. my son will be 7 months tomorrow and this toy is still strong and going!.:).. its been sat on and thrown by unrully children that visit and its still in perfect condition, and my son still loooves it! im glad i bought it!"
168600,2,"We love pampers, but this order was late and my baby outgrew this size! The company never returned my phone calls or emails so that I could return the product. I recommend finding diapers elsewhere"
123797,1,"I'm surprised to see all of the negative reviews. I bought this pump twice for both pregnancies and this pump worked well for me. I am pregnant again and looking for it but cant find in the stores. I am shocked to see how expensive it is on this site. I'm sorry to see that this product was such a disappointment to most of you, I guess you have to find what works best for you, this pump worked for me. Amazon bring the price down please."
58690,1,When I think about the huge plug in sterilizer that my mother had for me and my siblings as a baby. A sterilizer that seemed to take forever to clean and run I am still amazed that all you have to do is pour in water and stick it in the microwave. It also makes a great drying rack if you wash your bottles by hand instead of running them through a dishwasher. It saves so much time to just put them right into it as you wash them and everything stays organized. As a mom getting ready to have my second child in a few weeks I thank the baby industry for life simplifying non-essentials.
42391,1,"Love it. I was staring at my screaming colicky baby one day, saying, ""If I could just wrap tight to me...if I could just WEAR her, I bet it would help."" Then a couple days later...""I should get a looooong piece of fabric and just wrap us up together."" Then a friend bought me a Moby Wrap. If you are a more frugal person, just go get a 20ft long piece of fabric and watch the Moby Wrap website instructions. Tribal women have been working at home or in the fields with their babies this way for thousands of years. It works. It seems hard at first, but if you try it 4 or 5 times to figure out how tight to put it, all the learning and work is worth it. If you stay at home, just put it on the in the morning and then you don't really need to adjust it again all day. Put it on BEFORE you go to the store or other event so you aren't exposing it to nasty floor surfaces. This product has saved my arm muscles from going dead having to hold a colicky baby 24/7. After trying it twice, it now takes me only 2 minutes to put it on, get the baby in, and have everything adjusted. Take the time to learn how to use it, and it will pay off for you, I guarantee it."
108004,0,"This is a great pump for travel or here and there pumping. Manual pumping just cannot compare to electric pumping for full-time use. I have the pump in style advanced (which I LOVE - worth every penny). I got this one for travel and it works well, but I don't see how manual pumping can ever beat automatic pumping. It works well enough, but takes some getting used to. The other thing to be weary of is only silicone nipples are available with the Avent system. My son quit silicone nipples after 3 months and the avent system does not have latex. I've since found out that this is fairly common, so if you go with the Avent system, you may end up having to change and this pump does not fit standard size bottles. If you have to choose between this and the Medela, go with Medela! (Make sure to get a new one as I've heard the older ones do not work nearly as well.)"
51735,0,"I bought this swing and my baby loved it and the music, but a month after I purchased it the music stopped working. The manufacter was very good about addressing a refund and sending out prepaid postage labels for the defective product, but as I just sent it back I don't know how long the actual refund process takes. I loved being able to plug the swing in, and the pockets on the sides for toys and such. But, the seat does not recline far enough for the baby to fall asleep comfortably. I have a big baby(16 lbs at 2months) and it seemed to swing well enough for the up to 25 lbs. rating. I didn't really think the speed settings actually adjusted the speed. I ended up buying the Graco lovein' Hug to replace this swingGraco Lovin Hug Easy Entry Open Top/Curved Frame Swing in Bancroft, but the Margo color. It is great and I like it so much better. It has a five point harness, the baby can recline more and in a more comfortable seat, it swings great even with my little one now weighing over 20 lbs., and I like the settings better. He seems so much more comfortable in the Graco swing."
134310,1,"This wipes warmer serves its purpose. It does take a while to warm up, but once the wipes are warm, it stays that way and makes diaper change a lot more comfortable for my baby. I definitely recommend this product! It is a worthwhile investment!"
165083,1,The diapers are wonderful and we've never had leakage problems. They also don't have an odd odor like some othere more generic brands when full. We get these at our house through Subscribe & Save so they are about $15 cheaper than buying them at Target/Costco/BJs and they deliver in two days.
6050,1,"We're expecting our first child, so we're probably over the top on our room decorating. The border is very brightly colored, so I was concerned that if there were different production lots in the shipment, the colors wouldn't match up well. Fortunately, when we did receive it, all the lots did match. The pattern repeats frequently enough that it's easy to match without significant trimming or waste. It's about like any other wallpaper border to install.Overall, the entire series of Animal Antics products have good color matching, and we've been pleased with everything we've gotten."
100944,1,Love Pampers baby dry - they work great for my daughter and I use them at night since she sleeps for up to 12 hours. I have been using them at night for her since she was an infant and she is now 14 months. I switched to Luvs during the day though since they are cheaper.
25148,1,"We love this windscreen for the BOB. It shields our son from cold wind and direct sunlight. It's easy to attach and remove, and our son can still see out of the stroller when it is installed."
93574,2,"I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that's had this problem with this potty! We bought this over a year ago for our son to try to potty train him before he was 2. He was absolutely amazed at the music when he went (even though it didn't always go when it was supposed to and sometimes went when it shouldn't) and always wanted to ""go potty."" Unfortunately, he eventually tired of it and was no longer ""thrilled"" at the music. My biggest complaint, however, is that it leaks! What good is a potty chair that won't hold the contents?!?!? Somewhere between the guard and the bowl itself there's obviously not a tight enough fit. I would've thought they would've tested this kind of thing before it was ever put on the market! Don't waste your money on this one."
28874,0,"The Glider was received with an arm of the glider repaired. Since the repair is not visible, the damaged arm does not show.

160669,1,"This crib sheet is so great I couldn't live without it! Make sure that you get more than one. The snaps are easy and it washes very well if you follow directions (wash warm in gentle cycle, and tumble dry low)."
11363,1,I recently ordered and used this product for my child and I'm happy to say that it hasn't disppointed me. My child really enjoys it and sleeps alot better with it. Every parent should try this out for their child it is a great product. I hope to see more products like this soon.
11964,1,"My six month old was always reaching for any fruit I was eating. So I bought these and put in small slices of peaches, nectarines, and frozen pieces of pears and he loves it! They are easy to use and clean. Just turn inside out and rinse or throw in the dishwasher. The bags get a little stained from the fruit juices but who cares? My baby doesn't. :)"
9092,2,I purchased this item at an additional 30% off the &quot;clearance price&quot; thinking this was a great deal regardless of the quality. Wrong. I returned it. I will buy a regular CD player that actually has sound and can be controlled from afar while baby is sleeping. Save your money and invest in a regular CD player. Baby will love you for it.
152782,1,"You can't go wrong with this seat. I paid $39.99 (I wish more people would also post what they paid since Amazon's prices change and it doesn't help when people say ""it's worth the money"") - how much? Anyway, for $39.99, you can't go wrong. My kid loves the cup holders on each side along with a little holder for his hot wheels. The colors of this chair are neutral enough and I liked that. The only reason I give it a 4 star rating is because the plastic cup holders don't slide out very smoothly, but what do you expect from a booster seat? It's functional. It's not a Lexus Booster Seat. :)"
168634,1,"I have always used Pampers Swaddlers for both my kids and had no issues.We have tried other brands and other varieties in the Pampers brand but had problems like scratched baby skin, leaks, etc."
84351,2,"I thought I would like this swing but the tray is very difficult to get on. Whenever my son sees this he gets so excited he dives toward the swing but it takes too long to get the tray apart (two handed motion and still difficult). He is comfy and I think safe when he is in the swing, but VERY DIFFICULT to get him out."
150772,1,"Not bad for the money. This dresser is affordable, and with twins on the way, we are trying to cut costs as much as possible! It is made of pressed wood, and the back and drawer bottoms seem a little flimsy, but once you put it together it looks great and is much sturdier than I thought it would be. My husband put it together in a couple hours, he said the instructions were easy but it was a lot work. I got the dresser to go with Graco espresso cribs, and it matches perfectly. No regrets on this purchase. We saved about $200 compared to my first choice, but this will definitely do."
147506,1,"We use this almost every day. It's great for our baby to sit in and watch the world around her. We have used it since birth. At first she was not interested in the bears, but you can easily remove that bar to make it easier to get them in and out. Now she is 4 months and loves to play with the bears. The seat folds up very easily and is very compact - we can even slide it under the couch."
73063,1,"I bought this when my baby was 6 months old and not stellar at sitting up. This is excellent for that awkward ""in-between"" stage when they are really too small for the cart seat but too big for the carrier anymore. She is now 14 months old and I still use it... I like the fact that you can use it on restaurant highchairs of all types as well as shopping carts. There are cheaper ones out there, but 4 out of 5 mothers in my mom's group bought the lower priced models and regretted it. If you think about the health of your baby and what you save in the long run limiting their exposure to carts that are never washed, I think you will be pleased with purchase."
4999,1,"We decided to go ""greener"" as a New Year's Resolution. We use 7th Generation as a backup to cloth diapers. The 7th Generation seems pretty similar to other disposable diapers. I would say though that they fit a little larger than Huggies or Pampers. My son usually wears a size 4 in Huggies/Pampers, but the 7th Generation size 4 were almost too big on him."
101909,2,My baby initially chewed on this and after a few minutes she dropped it. I gave it back to her and she would not put it in her mouth. I tried it and realized that there is a terrible chemical odor. It is not dishwasher safe or able to be boiled. I worry about the chemicals baby would be ingesting. It will be picked up by the garbagemen this week.
75337,1,"I've been using this pump 3 times a day, 5 days a week, for the past 6 months and it works just as it did the first day. It has the same suctioning power of a Madela for a third of the price. A little background: during the first month of my baby's life I used a hospital grade Madela Symphony that I rented from my hospital. So here is my comparison of the two:The Madela has a dial that varies the degree of suction, and it is much quieter, but it is very bulky and heavy.The Lansinoh has buttons that allow you to vary the degree of suction and the speed as well, it has a timer that allows you to see how long you've been pumping,it is very light weight, but it is quite loud. (To muffle the loudness of the Lansinoh pump I simply place it under my knees while pumping at work. No one has ever complained of hearing me.)Another thing to point out is that the tubes from a Madela are not protected, so water vapor can build up in the tubes. The Lansinoh tubes are not in direct contact with the pump opening so the always have remained dry.In a nutshell, it's a great pump for a great price, but if you have money and don't mind a bulky, heavy, quieter pump,then get the Madela."
80223,2,"I can't believe Pampers are selling these diapers for our tinest consumers and put them through misery, Pampers should have withdrawn it from the market. I bought these diapers for my newborn son and now I'm so sorry for him. The diaper leaks through his back and every time I change him, I have to change his clothes, his blanket and his sheet. I have to buy Huggies and they seem to be doing a better job in keeping my son dry."
95418,1,"We have so many stuffed animals that were just laying and taking up space on our basement floor, that we needed something to get them organized. I bought 3 of the Jumbo Toy Hammocks, and they took care of the problem. They turn out to hold more than they appear they will, when you take them out of the package. I don't believe I would refer to them as Jumbo, but rather call them , Toy Hammock. Good product so far."
92551,1,It works great and was shipped in a timely manner. Our baby can now eat all the food we eat and she loves it!
176777,0,At first the hardest part was measuring the water to heat the amount of formula without over or under heating it. Once I got the hang of it I was pretty happy but it only lasted about 2 months before breaking. It also takes about 5 minutes to warm up a bottle and 10 minutes to cool down.
149132,1,"I admit I was hesitant because of some of the reviews mentioning that seam. I almost bought the candy cane shaped pillow instead, but really glad I chose this one ! I cannot sleep with a head pillow period and was planning on using the open end for my head and neck. This pillow is so versatile ! I can sleep in the middle and turn side to side, or sleep on either side . I can put my feet on the closed side so my ankles are raised. I especially love that more than one person can use it at the same time. Great for watching tv with the family. The middle section is great if you have an older child that is super squirmy and all over the bed when they sleep. I have six kids and never had a body pillow when I was pregnant then, so I'm making up for lost pillow love. If I think of any more uses I'll come back and write more."
78289,1,I like this seat. It is easy to take with you. It attaches easily to any chair. The only thing that I didn't like was that my child grew out of the tray part very quickly. I could no longer fit the tray over him after he turned about 1 year old and he's not a large child. I would recommend this seat.
46506,1,We are very happy with this rail. It is very easy to put together and it looks nice.Highly recommended.
93490,2,"I thought the musical potty would be a great idea for my 2 year old. Instead, it's annoying, because any movement sets off the music and EVERYTIME he sits on it, IT LEAKS!!! I'm constantly having to clean the bathroom floor after my son is done using it. I definitely would NOT recommend this potty to anyone!"
8215,2,I was scared to let my baby sleep in the basket at night b/c I was scared he would get pushed up against the sides. Good for napping though. Can't beat the price.
40065,0,"Great sounds from the Sound Sleeper, but the volume wasn't as loud enough.I was looking for something that would drown out the loud noise of our household but it did not work at all. I also got this after my daughter was 4 months old and it might be better suited for a newborn? She didn't not find the noises comforting."
90254,1,These diapers are ok for the money. They get the job done but I still miss the Swaddlers that we used to use. I wish they made them in a size 4 but they only go up to 3.
68265,1,Purchased this product for first time mom and everyone at the shower was interested in it because Shopping Cart covers were not on her list. Who would think of this except my daughter who has an 10 month old and uses hers all the time. The product was exactly as shown in the photos.

130080,0,"I really love the aquarium series! So when I got a different swing for my baby shower, I ran right back down to Babies R Us and got my aquarium swing!Unfortunately, I have some negative points:1) The first setting on the swing is SO FAST that we cannot use it for my newborn. It looks like it will launch him across the room. This is particularly a pain in the butt because you have to walk over and push them every min or so to keep them soothed.2) The music and lights will only play for about 5 mins. So you have to run over there every 5 mins and restart the music. That's the most annoying thing.Other than that..it looks great?"

71167,1,I wish that this was the only bouncy seat that I had registered for. I like this one because it leans back for when they are pre-sitting up and then it makes a great chair for them when they are 6-8 months for watching Einstein videos etc. I will agree with the other reviews that I have noticed my daughter leaning out of it and I have been worried that she is going to flip it. I know to be extra careful with her in it. But even with that said it could be put away until they are walking and brought back out to use as a toddler chair. My neice has this chair and still uses it to watch TV and she is 4. A great chair that you wont have to put in storage right away.
144580,1,"I have 7 children and I gave up on diaper pails years ago. I keep a few of these bags in the diaper bag, my van and my husbands car. They keep it smell of the diaper in the bag really well.

I even use these bags for kitty litter, when I clean the cat litter box I put the cat poop in a bag and tie it up = No Smell!"
37932,1,I like baby wipes that I can flush. A lot. These are the best! The last order I placed with Amazon was the wrong kind. Which is the first time Amazon has ever biffed an order of mine. Which is fine. Even the non-sensitive ones are not so bad.
80909,1,"I read a lot of reviews for covers before deciding on this one. The main things that I love about this cover is:-pillows are nice for my 6 month old whos not too sure of sitting up on his own yet-very easy to put in cart and pack back up one handed while holding a baby-cute fabric and nice and sturdy-toy straps so he always has something to play with and I don't have to worry about them falling or getting lost.The only draw back for me (and it's not even a huge deal for me) is that it does run a little small for larger carts...but if you play with it, you'll learn what you can do to make it work for them.I am very happy with this cover and if I have another baby...I will be happy to use it for the next one too!"
159672,1,"I can't rave enough about this bouncer. I had the original one with the blue striped pattern on the seat. I used it through two baby boys then passed it on to a friend. I am expecting a new baby and started shopping for a new bouncer seat. First the baby papasan caught my eye, but it didn't seem entertaining enough. So, we bought the new aquarium bouncer with the new fish print on the seat. We had such good luck with the first seat we can't go wrong. It would entertain my boys for hours. Also, the vibration is perfect for a new baby. Can't wait to use the new bouncer with my new little one.Tip: Buy a navy colored headrest to use in the bouncer seat for your newborn, it greatly helps with a baby's weak neck, then simply remove it when baby is bigger."
18506,1,"I originally registered for the Avent bottles (and received over 20!) since my sister loved them so much, but my son, now 5 months old, had terrible gas. He was a good burper, but still had terrible pains and became colicky. A sister-in-law suggested Playtex Nursers which she used for her kids. She even bought some for me to try, but they didn't help. I even tried the VentAires. My pediatrician immediately recommended Dr. Browns bottles. I hesitated since I had never heard of them before, but tried them anyway. These are BOTTLES FROM HEAVEN! The original slender bottles were the only ones out at the time we bought these. The small and softer nipple was easier for him to use than the big and stiff Avent ones. It took him half the time to finish feeding and reduced his gas significantly. We also noticed that he didn't burp as loudly which could only mean that he wasn't swallowing as much air.I know cleaning 2 extra parts is a common complaint, but it only takes a few extra seconds...nothing considering the hours of pain and crying (for both you and baby) you'll avoid. I would suggest rinsing out the bottles as soon as you can to lessen the chances of gunk to form.We have since bought a 3 pack of these wide necks...the nipples are bigger, but my son likes them just the same. Since each baby is different, I would recommend buying a slender and a wide to see which nipple your baby likes first before buying a bunch. I wish someone told me that before I opened all the Avent bottles that we no longer use.Now for my one complaint (without which, I would change my rating to 5 stars). I wish that the covers were designed like the Avent ones. The Avent covers are slightly shorter than the nipple so they depress it a little to prevent leaking (similar to holding your finger over the nipple). The Dr Browns bottles require a separate disc that's placed under the nipple to block fluid and has to be removed before feeding. An extra piece that can be lost and an extra step I would love to forego. I've done without the discs and just make sure that the bottles stay upright when I'm out and about.This one problem just isn't enough to bypass this product. Dr Browns will be the only bottles I will ever use for my kids. These are worth every penny!"

103951,1,"I just bought the Isis IQ Duo a week ago and I absolutely love it. It's easy to use and it cuts the amount of time I spend pumping in half. I was using the Avent manual pump which I also highly recommend. The manual pump worked great - I would pump 2-5 oz in about 20-25 minutes, which was okay but a little time consuming at work. The Isis Duo cuts that time in half, doubled the amount of milk I was getting and it doesn't take long to set up either. The motor is really quiet. I don't know why the one reviewer says that you can't change the suction because that's just not true. You start by manually pumping and when you push the button it continues to pump with the same rhythm and amount of suction that you apply and you can change it at anytime during the session. It comes with 4oz & 9 oz bottles. I've never seen a bottle smaller than 4oz. It is expensive, but I believe it was well worth the money."
69062,1,pampers is the only brand that has ever worked for my kids sensitive skin and still stopped leaks like nobody's business. the mesh liner on the cruisers and swaddlers keep the mess away from their skin and makes clean up easier and the stretchy sides keep them on better at night.
100940,0,"Accidently ordered this one instead of ""Dry Max"" ... the diapers are thinner, lighter and didn't hold as much as ""Dry Max"", but it's usable. Because it didn't cost much cheaper than ""Dry Max"" ... so this was the only non-Dry Max Pampers that I ordered since."
142633,1,"I wish I had taken this to the hospital with me...it would have made breast feeding so much easier. Instead, I was forced to use multiple pillows, which would slip and slide all over the place. Frustrating! As soon as I got home, however, I started using this product, and breast feeding went much more smoothly. This pillow is the perfect shape to hold the baby while breast feeding, and the fact that it has a strap to secure it onto your body is wonderful."
69710,1,Will need black out liners behind these. Thought they might be a little thicker material. Came all wrinkle too & hard to iron. Had to starch out the wrinkles.
151900,1,"Great, simplistic in design and function glad I found them. My Black Labrador loved getting into the closet to ""explore"". Hasn't happened since I installed them and the clear plastic blends into the door finish."
151873,1,"These are great, easy to install, fits perfect on my doors, they are solid oak, perfect size, easy to slide back and forth. These will keep the kids out of the closet! Finally@!@!!@"
7748,0,"A very nice scent, for me; nicely balanced, smooth and nonsynthetic.A real pleaser when it is working for me. Very nice.I would truly love it if it held up closer to what I get from several otherproducts at this price point (>5 hours with decent taper off projection).It is too problematic for me to start off with an extra heavy application orneed to reinforce it every 2-3 hours or so, which seems to be the case here.It also has a very heavy burn rate, given it's poor longevity.Side by side it just expires way too quickly and it wasn't a fake either(unless fakes have penetrated top shelf department stores/not likely).Sadly I needed to move on as I just couldn't get comfortable with carryingaround a mini atomizer or sample bottle, nor did I want to go without. A ladymight carry their mobile supply where I just can't be that dependant and prissy.It will fade fast for you too, bet on it. If thats OK I'd say go for it."
4570,0,"Was so looking forward to get my hands on this item and just received last week. H-E-A-V-Y is all I can say when I hold and carry the empty bag. Nice compartments and the material used truly of high quality and can see this bag will last for years to come.Pros:(1)EASILY ACCESIBLE DIAPER WIPE @ Front. I used this to put hand wipes since I like that it is at the front and easily accesible by myself, my husband and my 4.5 yrs old todler whenever we go out with the 6 months old baby. I bought a diaper changing kit by Especially for Baby from BabyRUs which is Black and made of same material, matches the bag PERFECTLY and toss it inside the zipper compartment where the diaper pad located, didn't like the diaper pad provided, TOO FLIMSY, NOT PRACTICAL!(2)Material used for inside and outside of the bags are ""tough"" material, can see that this bag can last for a long time even w/ rough handling.Cons:(1)OMG, this bag is so HEAVY when EMPTY that once loaded w/ thermos, 2 baby bottles, formula dispenser container, diaper changing kit loaded w/ diaper and a travel case wipe as well as 1 set of baby clothing that it is REALLY HEAVY even for my husband.(2)The stroller strap on ech side, the strap is made of ribbon like material and not enough width, can see that it will break soon if the diaper bag is kept hanging all the times on stroller w/ all the jugglings using the bag while hanging on stroller. Also, DIFFICULT to hang the bag onto stroller once the bag filled out w/ stuffs, all these due to the stroller strap is thin and the hook is a little small.(3) Can't squeeze anything INTO the bag once you filled out things in the outside zippered pockets. Some how, this bag is designed to filled out INWARDLY and not stretchable outwardly.IMPROVEMENTS FOR THIS PRODUCT:(1) get rid of that FLIMSY diaper pad, UNNECESSARY!!! Replace this w/ a diaper changing kit that has the same size and great padding like Especially for Baby though unlike Especially for Baby diaper changing kit, made everything cover w/ fabric on the outside so that the diaper wipe case and diapers are enclosed w/ fabric on the bottom and the top is made of mesh. Don't mind that the manufacturer charge $10 or so more since getting this separately also the same price but it is so COOL to have a diaper bag w/ its separate diaper changing kit when you just need to change diaper only, you just take the kit and no need to open the bag for anything at all since the diaper kit has all you will for diaper changing.(2) Made this into a backpack too so that it can be used as crossbody, shoulder and backpack.(3) PLEASE PLEASE USE LESS DENSE FABIRC OR MATERIAL!!! THIS BAG IS SUPER DUPER HEAVY EVEN WHEN IT IS EMPTY!!! Do consider lighter material yet durable. Suggestion is to use those material that Tumi used in their crossbody bags which is SO LIGHT YET SO VERY DURABLE & STAIN RESISTANT AS WELL AS STRETCHABLE!!!(4) Improvement needed in the stroller straps!! THIN & FLIMSY straps as well as difficult to hang on stroller after diaper bag is filled w/ stuffs. Design and material used for the stroller straps needed to be changed.(5) Please consider making the flap of messenger bag be reversible like the sport bag too! Charge a little bit more if necessary as I would be willing to pay rather than getting another flap. One side is w/ design and the other side is solid w/ strip.(6) Have a cell phone pouch some where outside the bag, either on the bag or strap.(7) Need to be WIDER so that can put many things inside the bag.(8) Include 2-3 mini color coded collapsable vynl cube-like containers that are stackable, w/ or without lids, so that one can store snacks and not be crushed or baby foods inside and able to locate it instantly.Now, if all the above suggestions are included into the next generation of Dadgear Diaper Bag, would definitely give this a 5 Star Diaper Bag."
57588,0,"Just purchased this for my grandson. It is very soft and I think he will enjoy it. IT does NOT look at all like the presented image. IT is solid yellow, spots and ears are same solid yellow. Grandson kept saying WHAT is it? I also purchased a different brand pillow in shape of Monkey which he recognized immediately."
142562,1,"This pillow saved us having had latching problems. I received a Boppy as a gift but it was too roundish and bulky for my newborn to be positioned properly. It was great only as a pillow to prop my baby in a reclined position. The My Brest Friend is like a little mattress that fastens to you so that the baby can lie down and latch onto you correctly. I am very petite and this pillow worked much better on my frame, esp when breastfeeding using different holds. I used the pocket for holding my baby's comb, tissues, and other items that I could use on her while she was nursing. I also liked how the cover is removable and machine-washable. The clip on this cover is also durable and I have not had it break on me. I actually have the foam pillow version (not the inflatable travel version) from Pottery Barn Kids, but the clip on the PBK cover actually broke. The My Brest Friend company sent me a new cover at no cost, proving that they stand by their product and are very conscientious about consumer satisfaction. PBK offered to exchange my pillow for a new one, but I declined b/c the clip on their cover is more fragile - a major design flaw, but at least PBK was most willing to help me out. I have also used the inflatable travel version and wish I purchased it instead of the foam pillow version for easier storage until the next baby. The My Brest Friend pillow is a must-have for first-time breastfeeders. It is a great investment."
94087,2,"Unless you have 20 minutes to kill while your baby is screaming for a bottle, you don't want this. I first used this on a venture to BRU for a Grandparent's Day Breakfast and while Grandma was sitting in on a 529 seminar, my daughter suddenly discovered that she was beyond famished - so up we go out to the car to warm up a bottle! Now, supposedly this warmer can be used with Dr. Brown's bottles but the combination didn't work for us. First of all, the bottle has to be positioned in the warmer a certain way so that it presses a safety latch to keep the warmer on. Unless the bottle is a regular generic bottle with a gallon of fluid inside, it won't keep the heating latch engaged. I had to sit there and continuously push the bottle down onto the latch AND then after 10 minutes, the bottle was still ice cold! I have no idea how to warm a bottle in the car and have no reccomendations, but I will tell you that this mini blood pressure machine will do nothing to benefit the appetite of an impatient child when she's hungry!"
55008,1,"The most important part of the whole seat is the ducks head and the slope down around the duck's feet. This provides a true barrier for preventing little boys from peeing over the seat onto the floor in front of the toilet when sitting. Other seats have the raised part in front of the seat, but becuase the legs are not any lower their penis can point straight out and sent pee over the small barrier.This was the thrid seat that I tried for a potty training boy. This seat is easy enough for him to take on and off by himself, and secure enough when on that he can climb on by himself. He did use a step to get on at the start, but a year later he still uses it but with out the use of a step."
184468,1,The monitor was quiet and did not have a buzzing sound as others I used have. Our babies voice and noises were very clear. I highly recommend this monitor. Especially for new mom's like myself as I could even here my daughter breathe.
124147,0,"Overall, I'm happy with this frame, but...It comes with blue and pink ribbons, not green.It's a bit scratched in places. I touched it up and it's fine, but frustrating.This was a huge challenge with my month old daughter. She is really mellow and easy-going, but she HATED the plaster. It was really hard to get a good image.That being said, now that it's done, it's absolutely darling."
42761,1,"There are pros and cons to every wrap, and this one is no exception. That said, if I could only have one wrap, it would probably be the Moby Wrap; it does everything, and while it can be tougher to get used to, it's ultimately more flexible - both literally (softer) and in terms of use.Most reviews cover the basic pros and cons. I'll recap those, but I want to start by pointing out a couple of things I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere.First, I highly recommend getting a LIGHT color in the organic material. Reason being this carrier is warm to begin with; even a moderately warm day, in a black, heavy jersey material carrier your baby will get HOT. Second, babies get cradle cap - many of them quite a bit. Nothing like putting on your precious new carrier and putting in your precious new baby and 10 minutes later it looks like it has snowed on the carrier. (I foolishly got the black, thinking this color might incline my husband to wear it more.) And organic? Because chances are, your baby will chew on it like crazy after 3 months.Second, be aware that not every baby will like every carrier all the time, and not every carrier will work for every situation. My daughter hated the Moby - for the first month. My daughter loved the Ergo - after three months. My daughter plain hated the sling, but I think that was the fault of the poor material of the Seven Slings sling. (Go Maya Wrap.) A Moby is wonderful to put on in the morning and forget about, using off and on all day - making it perfect for at-home use or short use during errands - but as it can get bunched up and too loose in parts as the day goes on, and thus requiring re-wrapping, I find that for long walks I prefer the Ergo. Similarly, it's great because of the one-size-fits-all aspect - but if you're trading it back and forth frequently, a structured carrier like the Ergo is much easier to work with (no worries about dragging it on the ground at the park during the re-tying phase). A squirmy baby might be easier in the Ergo (no pulling loose panels), but a colicky baby seems to do better in the more confining, incredibly soft Moby. You never think about how stiff fabric can be until you're holding it against a newborn; that's one of my favorite aspects of the Moby. It felt like an extension of me, almost - like I'd popped her inside my shirt. It's very similar to feeling pregnant again, only much less hard on the ligaments!So although I certainly didn't want to hear it, the truth is most people need at least two kinds of wraps, maybe three. And keep in mind that babies have opinions and may love or hate a specific carrier depending on the day.To recap some of those other frequently mentioned cons and pros:CONS:- less structured, more easily loosened & requiring retying; not as good for long-term wear or long walks (which isn't to say it isn't good for wearing for hours at a time puttering around in the house; just not ideal for fast-paced walking in the woods, in my experience)- no back support like a structured carrier- can overheat baby in summer (or even late spring, depending on your climate)- requires practice and watching a lot of videos to learn how to wrap (better yet, join a mom's group and ask someone to help you!)- bulky, if you intend to try to carry it in your purse (better to just wear it out)PROS:- extremely secure hold - comparable to a more structured carrier, unlike slings, making it possible (halleluia!) to have two functional hands; makes grocery shopping, house cleaning, even a little cooking possible (prep work, cold foods)- spreads out the weight on your body well; no shoulder pain- soft, soft, soft- buy organic, perfect when your baby starts chewing on everything (my baby did at 3 months)- light color camouflages dandruff- excellent at keeping baby warm- womb-like tightness exceptionally useful for crying babies (essentially works as swaddling)- can breastfeed in with practice- one size fits all- multiple wrap styles - critical for the picky baby- no starter weight limit; you can use it straight out of the hospital- easy to store; just hang folded a few times on a hanger (unlike the bulky structured carriers that take up all the space in your closet)- super easy to clean - toss it in the laundry, no parts to remove- no parts to lose"
123049,2,"My kids want to play in it but don't want to sit on it. The music is very loud and the sensor turns the voice that says ""you went potty"" on when little hands go into the bowl. This encourages kids to touch the inside of the bowl, not exactly tidy. Get a Baby Bjorn. This thing is going out in the next yard sale!"
31121,1,"I agree with most of other reviewers comments, it is a very good one if you have an active 3 year old, especially a boy. My 3.5 boy would give this stroller a 5 star as now he refuses to ride his bike & scooter, all he does is get in and out of the stroller, he never gets tired of it, he stand on it backford, forward, sideward, sit on it, knee on it, ride it like a scooter, hand and dangle from the push bar, it is so much fun.The sunshade seems to be sufficiently large.However, for a parent, the front seat seems to be too hard (not well cushioned), my baby does not seem to be too comfortable in it (but he does not complain), and the stroller is not as sturdy as my other strollers, it wiggles which makes me worry that it may fall apart. It is especially not sturdy on an even path, and prone to tilt over, and hard to push around on uneven path (which is what we like to do).And, the front tray is difficult to get off, unlike other ones you can unhook one side and swirle it to the side."
51080,1,"The shipment was on time, the pillow arrive just the way it should have and in time for Christms. Thank you!"
108574,0,"This will do what it says, get in the cracks of the peanut butter/jelly jar, but essentially i'm not sure after trying it how it does it any differently than just angling a typical butter knife in the jar does it, maybe it's supposed to keep your hand from getting sticky or something. Overall though it's just ok, great if you like lots of toys in your kitchen, or for little kids if you prefer they not use a real knife/table knife."
1594,1,"Pampers have come to be my favorite, they pull it away from skin well, and hold a lot. I love subscribe and save, great value and I never have to run out to get diapers."
56803,1,"This is the second potty chair we have purchased. Although this is simple looking and a simple design, it works perfect. My two year old boy, has no problem with leaks, no spray issues with the splash guard, he fits on it perfect, it is really easy to clean and dump. What more could you ask for. I do recommend to not get the musical throne by fisher price. It leaks terribly. I am so excited, I thought I would have had to go through many seats before finding the right one."
150073,1,"I bought this for a 12 hour road trip with my 19 month old son. I think he may be too young for it, but it rests on his knees & seems to really bug him.I really like the raised sides, it keeps his playthings and cheerios from sliding off of the tray. This keeps us from having to twist around from the front & try to retrieve the ""lost"" items. :)It's very large, so plenty of room for his books. He likes to ""read"" in the car, but his little hands often have trouble holding on to the books, so this solves that problem.I also like the netted holders on the side for when he is older and has the dexterity to reach in and pull things out.I don't like how it rests on his legs. It's vinyl and therefore is uncomfortable on his skin and is hot (we live in Florida). But it is very easy to wipe off.We have a Britax Boulevard and the sides slope too steeply is the reason why it rests on his knees.He'll use it for about 10 minutes, then he wants it off. Maybe when he's older, it won't bother him as much."
5049,1,Using Seventh Generation Diapers is as close as I can get to helping the environment when it comes to diapers. I refuse to use cloth diapers. I have three young girls and two are still in diapers. I buy the diapers through Subscribe and Pay at Amazon so I save money and the diapers come everymonth. There is no need for an emergency diaper run!
25702,0,I got this because the other head support I had didn't prevent my son's head from going straight forward... chin to chest. This said it would cradle his jaw to prevent this... but my son pulls his head out to look at toys in his lap... then falls asleep with his chin to his chest. So it didn't work the way I wanted it to.
103538,1,"I love toys! As a grandma, mamma, and ex-teacher, this one ranks HIGH on my list. I currently have a toddler grand-daughter that continues to be drawn to this delightful arrangement of busy-play! The burner that bubbles and sizzles is our absolute favorite....she stirs, covers, and watches it all happen! It really does a great job engaging her pro-longed attention! I just watch in delight!"
71463,2,I can't by a product that has too many negative reviews. I can't see it and I am not wasting my time to return it.
62887,1,"This seems to be the minority opinion, but having owned both I'll take the twistaway Diaper Genie over the Diaper Champ any day.Some of the criticisms are valid. It's a little fiddly to use and the fact that you have to use the proprietary refills isn't as convenient or quite as cheap, but I think these criticisms are greatly exaggerated and the tradeoff in odor control makes it a no-brainer for us.Regarding odor, I can only conclude that those who say the Champ works just as well as the Genie either A) have small infants whose diapers don't smell much to begin with, or B) have no sense of smell. With the Champ, we abandoned the rocker near the changing table. The area reeked. The Champ makes a loud wooshing noise every time the plunger drops. Where do you think that air is coming from? With the twistaway Genie, even when filled to the brim, the area is odorless. There's a slight smell for a minute when you open it to dispose of a diaper, but that quickly dissapates, and when it's closed, it's on lockdown.Regarding the criticisms, I just don't understand the complaints that it's too complicated. No, it's not quite as ridiculously simple as the Champ, but we're talking a 4 on the 1-10 scale instead of a 2. And personally, I find it easier to empty and refill than the Champ. Also, the complaints about the cost of the refills are vastly overblown. We go approximately three weeks on a $6 refill cartridge. In the same span, we'd use a couple bucks worth of regular garbage bags with the Champ, so we're spending about $4-5/month more on the Genie. It's hardly a burdensome expense, and well-justified, I think.In sum, unless you're EXTREMELY sensitive to cost or ease of use issues, this is clearly the way to go.(For the record, I have not tried the Diaper Genie II, but based on the mechanism I have my doubts that it controls odor as well as the original.)"
181898,1,"This item was actually a great buy, just if you are shipping it gift wrapped then expect it to arrive in an ugly HUGE blue bage with a lame attempt at a decent green ribbon."
102946,2,"This pail caught my eye with its promise to eliminate smell and what looked like ease of use. It is difficult to get the bag in, you must push the diaper past the &amp;quot;diaphragm&amp;quot;, often the springs come undone, and the plastic soaked in the diaper odor so it is consistently smelly. Also, you have to use a full size garbage bag and waste most of the bag space. Try it if you wish, but I'll be shopping for a new one for my next baby!!"
69540,2,"Bought 2 of these because we are taking a road trip in late August. I have two children under 4, so keeping them comfortable and able to sleep in their seats is a priority for this trip. I was excited to find these set belt pillows but very disappointed when I received them and returned them the next day. The fabric is not soft at all and the velcro straps are huge. The pictures on the website, seem to be deceiving as the straps are hidden and the pillows look larger than they really are. I ended up buying 2 very cute and soft body style pillows/stuffed animals from IKEA in the kids department. They are not seat belt pillows, but they are the perfect size and the kids love them."
158162,2,"My changing table arrived with a broken safety strap. My first phone call resulted in instructions to ""email Julio"" which I immediately did. It is now a month later and repeated phone calls and voice messages have still not resulted in an answer, much less a replacement strap. Since the assembly instructions are emphatic that the product must never be used without straping the child to the table, it is useless to me."
40381,2,"$7.49 to $10+ is ridiculous. I'll go back to buying diapers at Walmart and other grocery stores. You'll lose a LOT of sales with this, Amazon!"
1055,2,"When my son wheres Pampers, the poop always rides up his back. I am very disappointed in these diapers and can't believe all the positive reviews. I gave it 2 stars because it does hold in pee alright for 3-4 hours max. These diapers don't perform as well as Huggies Snug & Dry."
21535,1,"We got this chair right when the baby was born, and she LOVED it immediatly. She loves listening to the music. Her favorite thing on the chair right now is the orange speaker, but she is only 3 weeks old. The mobile and rattles catch her eye sometimes - I am sure as she gets older she will explore more on it. Overall I am very pleased with this product."
153499,1,My boys (2 & 4) love mixing the colors at bath time. The only reason I did not give a 5 stars- b/c the red looks more like purple.
108870,2,"I agree with the review that mentioned the short cord for the phone and the do-nothing buttons at the top. I would add that the graphics on the tray are simple paper decals, which are a poor choice for something to go on a baby tray. In no time they will be stained and torn and there's nothing you can do about it.I threw ours away after the bell underneath the phone got wet and then rusted. Really, the only advantage to this tray is that it is sized correctly to clip onto the main tray. I can think of nothing else positive about it."
138139,1,Charming and wonderful. My niece lays in her crib and giggles and coos as soon as this night light is turned on.Simply beautiful.
55744,1,My daughter would want her bottles on demand. Heating her bottles up the long way was not working. I purchased this in hopes that this will save me time and it did. I would keep the water vial filled with water so when a bottle needed to be heated I can just pour the water and heat. Was a life saver!
143972,1,"The instructions are difficult to understand, mostly because they don't really say anything helpful. That being said, it is fairly simple to figure out how to use this product. I was easy enough to put up, and then once we added the gate we bought, it completely solved our stair problem!One thing I wish I'd known: If you are using this with a pressure mounted gate, place the brackets on the banister as close to the points of contact for the gate mounts as possible.If you are deciding between this and a model that uses velcro and tension to hold the gate onto the post - don't bother with the velcro! We bought this after the other model broke (we'd only had it for a few weeks when the first strap gave out, then two months later the other one gave out and we were up a creek!)"
52350,1,These corner guards are very similar to ones I had purchased a number of years ago for our coffee table. The last set stayed on for about 2 years until I decided to take them off. This set appears to be identical and should last the same amount of time. Perfect for protecting toddlers and babys from nasty corners on the edges of tables. Easy to put on - just peel and stick!
30690,2,"We bought this for our first-born last February. It worked great at first, although the distance that it could ""travel"" never impressed us. After less than a year of using this, the cord that plugs into the base started not staying plugged in, it would fall out constantly. So multiple times a night we would have to go in to our sons room and re-adjust the machine in order to get the cord to stay plugged in. Would not recommend this monitor... especially for how expensive it is."
125975,1,"We started off using Pampers since that was what the hospital used. I experienced nothing but leaks. We decided to switch over to Huggies and we are very happy with the quality of the product. It's highly absorbent and fits really well. The diaper isn't as soft as I would like, but I'll trade the softness for absorbancy."
152697,1,"I got this at my baby shower and I put it together by myself a few days before I went into labor. It was not hard at all. I put some cheap batteries in it and it was ready to go when I brought my daughter home. I put her in it when I take a bath or shower. It folds up and can be put out of the way. My in-laws got a different small swing with toys and plays music and they had nothing but problems with it. It cost twice as much and was noisy and the batteries died in a week. I haven't changed the batteries in mine yet and my daughter is now 8 months old. She can still use it too. Sure it makes some noise, but it is just a quiet clicking. It put my baby to sleep lots of times. I have been happy with it and it was the cheapest one and the simplist one. I think it is great! I will use it with the next one too."
150143,1,I am thrilled with this seat. It is so nice to have another wonderful Britax product. I love knowing that we have extra side protection.
164240,1,"For my son, Huggies would always leak in his sleep. Pampers Baby Dry has a more snug fit and they keep my son dry at night."
109966,2,"First off, it took over an hour for me to put it together. The screws didn't line up with the holes, and one of the wheels still won't go in all the way so I can't even roll it around like I need to - it just sits in the closet. Would not recommend to anyone."
102463,1,"I brought it when my son was 6 months old, he enjoyed it and even now he is 14 months old, he still enjoys it. You have to take away to the turning part while he is able to get up on his own. Now before going to bed, he even turns on the music on his own and choose the piece of the music that he like. The music indeed offers some comfort and peace for him. It is such a good idea."
118574,1,"Works surprisingly well for being so low-tech! We are able to easily grind whatever we're eating for dinner for our baby. We started feeding him solid table food using the Mill around 5 months old. We're still using it at 10 months old, although he is anxious to pick up his food now vs the spoon. The Mill has successfully ground pasta, cooked vegetables, casseroles, fruit and more. We've put pork ribs in there and it mushes up what it can and leaves the tough stuff in the shaft. Likewise with vegetables. It will mush out the guts of the veggies and leave the skins that baby can't chew in the shaft. I only wish that the ""shaft"" could hold more food-- as our baby could eat more that it could grind in one use and after you've used it, it's slippery and messy-- a little difficult to refill for a second helping. We take it to Grandma's and out to eat. Throw it in the case dirty and stick it in the dishwasher when we get home! Great buy!"
63022,2,"My pump is about 5 years old. This seemed to be the part I was looking for...However,it did not fit. I am out of luck."
102687,1,"This is a great mobile. Very pretty, colorful, cute, the music is nice and calming and not too loud since it is supposed to be calming and not exciting. There is a little night light and my little girl loves to stare at it (8 months old). We have an Ikea cot so the frame is quite thin but I can see why this might not fit bulky framed and asymmetrical bed frames. 2 sound options and options to have the mobile turn or not and just to have the music, etc. Well worth the price. I do not use the remote, I just walk in the room or let it turn off on its own."
34575,2,"We had the same pail with our first kid. It sustained for 1.5 years and then despite changing the odor remover, it was not very effective. However, we thought it performed quite well for a cheap pail. However, when we bought our second pail, we were not too happy. It doesnt close properly and keeps opening with a loud noise at times (some times an hour after closing)."
82263,1,Purchased two locks for our lazy susans in our home. Easy to install and use. Saved a finger or two - definitely.
177177,0,"My mother bought this for my third baby due next week. I have never had a changing table before, but we needed some extra storage space. The finished product looks okay, and is sturdy..but putting that thing together was a TASK!!! I consider myself pretty handy...but the directions were INCOMPLETE, which is the most annoying thing in the world. The holes in the top front bar were not aligned with the crossbar so we had to drill an additional hole to make it fit. I hate the way the boards sit on the side bars...there are no grooves to hold them. Again, it seems pretty sturdy...but the assembly was the worst do-it-yourself experience I've had in years."
44274,1,"I bought this blanket a week before my due date (02/05). This blanket has been my baby's favorite since we used to take him out of the hospital. It is so big, warm, and fuzzy, I wish they made one for adults! He loves it so much, that recently we went to visit my mother, who lives out of state, and we lost his ""blankie"". I immediately had to go out the next day to buy another one because he had such a hard time going to sleep. And sure enough, the next night he slept like an angel!"
30424,0,"At first this was a great tub, but by the time my baby was 12 weeks old we couldn't use it anymore. She was 22 inches long at birth and 25 1/2 at 12 weeks and she just didn't fit anymore. The problem is that the plastic seat bottom is rammed into her back when she is in the sling and she is way too long to lie directly in the tub on the infant end. The seat back is only 12 inches long and my infant's torso and head already measures 17 inches.In short, this is a great tub for a small light baby but doesn't work if your baby is long, so if you have alot of height in your family, stay away from it."
150391,1,"Gave as a gift to my son and his wife and they rave about it. They like it's compact size, light weight, carry strap and especially the swing out arm so their toddler can climb into it herself."
61566,1,Delivered promptly; priced fairly and works very wellin a split foyer. Used for disabled adult.
43206,1,"This product is great and Amazon has the best price on it w/ the free shipping. If you're using the Graco Snugride, this stroller frame is perfect. The car seat clicks on so easily w/out any fuss. It feels very secure. The stroller is as lightweight as it advertises and as easy to fold up for storing. Perfect addition to your removeable infant car seat for shopping trips, etc. Don't waste your time with those bulky travel systems that every mom tells you they never even used."
169534,1,"My husband absolutely loves this bag. He is looking forward to using it when our little bundle arrives. Recommend it for anyone, the size and all the pockets are really nice and good in size."
72314,0,Good product but when the baby walks around she takes the whole middle unit with her. The middle unit does not stay in place and I have to put something on the bottom of it so it doesn't skid around.
161080,0,Giving this a 3 star because I bought this when my baby was about 4 months and a 1/2 and still could not hold it well. Also I find it hard to clean. Great idea but not working for my baby too well. Item was in great condition when received. We will keep trying as she get older and see how it work out.
101425,1,"We bought this for our playroom and have gotten so many comments from other parents who have come over and love it! I would have given it five stars, but the clips don't hold onto all stuffed animals very well, especially if they're a bit on the heavy side. Overall, it's a great addition to our playroom though and organizes all the stuffed toys so they're no longer in a heap on the floor and my kids actually notice and play with them again."
75120,2,"Our son is very squirmy on the changing table, so the teepee never stays in place. These are a great idea but don't work as we'd hoped. We've given up on them and just risk getting squirted."
13823,2,"I have wasted so much milk using these drop-ins. I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners, and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter. Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk, and believe me, I've done that many times. I've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole, I'll only waste a little bit. But, come on, I'm sleep deprived, and stressed and sometimes I forget, and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter, and I shouldn't have to check like that for a product I've paid for. No good.Out of a box of 100 liners, I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak. That's quite a lot; we're not talking one or two here. Unfortunately, I've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples, so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I cannot afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle. I'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter. I would NOT recommend."
122377,1,"I haven't actually used this yet, but tried it out with the carseat attached to the carryon. It should be perfect!"
37372,2,"Bought the bag for a recent trip, yes, it fit the stroller and car seat, unfortunately, after the first flight, it was ripped all over, after the second leg, more rips. I would not recommend this bag, it is nothing but a large canvas bag with no strength."
177887,1,"I purchased a ""Jenny Lind Cradle by Angel Line Finish: Maple""It was exactly what I was looking for!"
147190,1,"I have done TONS of shopping around and found the exact same set (6 pieces and everything) online at www.dreamtimebaby.com for $152.90 (not to mention free shipping). It does pay to shop around (even online). Another benefit, you can still register for the accessories at BRU and get a complete set! Worth the look!"
56310,1,"I got this tray for my 4 year old son for a very long car trip- we were in the car for 24 hours over 4 days, plus sight seeing once we got to our destination. He really enjoyed being able to play with his cars on the tray and it was a great place for me to have a stable surface to fix lunches and snacks at rest stops. The only problem we had was getting the strap tight enough to hold the tray stable. Once we got it, the tray worked great. Our son was using the tray for lunch when we were in an accident that totaled our car, and the tray wasn't a problem.We used this tray with a Graco Comfort Sport carseat."
60394,1,"We were hesitant to spend the extra money on this tub because with the shipping and higher price tag, this was considerably more money that most of the other tubs out there on the market. I was even more hesitant when we visited our neighbor who has one and saw how huge it is. The size was daunting but, with the great reviews we read online, we decided to give it a try. What an enormous difference it has made for a stress-free bath time! Before we bought this tub, we were bathing our son in a much smaller plastic tub and bathtime was a nightmare! I was a nervous wreck because when I tried to clean his body, he would squirm and slide all over the tub like a greased water ballon. Because of the firm grip I felt I had to have on him at all times, I did not feel I was able to clean him thoroughly enough because loosing my grip to completely clean him was sacrificing his safety. After a few weeks of miserable nighttime baths, he seemed to grow out of it and we looked for other options to bathe him in. Now with the Eurobath, he sits in the contoured seat and smiles while we bath him. It has dramatically changed our bathtimes from one with a crying baby, to one who actually enjoys getting a bath. We can also justify the price in that this tub will fit his body until he is big enough to take a bath in the regualr tub. Spend the extra cash on this tub and you will be glad you did!"
46894,1,"I ordered this for a friend who was having a baby girl.I was very happy with the quality of the basket, but thought the material used for the lining and blanket was a little cheap. The material for the blanket was really stiff and hard. It was almost like a changing pad."
25253,1,"I received this item quickly. That was nice. At first I thought it seemed rickety. But, now that I have had the extensions on the cosleeper for awhile and have moved it around, they seem pretty stable. They were extremely easy to install."
172542,2,"I was so excited for the shower, which only does not work, but the batterie compartment is not waterproof, and now leakps brow water. The sling is uncomfortable, as there is no leg room for my baby!! I can't wait to return it!!"
132868,1,"I have been using my Diaper Dekor for the past 6 months and I would not trade it for anything! Easy to use, easy to empty, and easy on the eyes makes this the perfect addition to any nursery! I am a veteran of the Diaper Genie and I can tell you that the Diaper Dekor is far better. First the DD (Diaper Dekor) is a simple, one-handed operation. Just push down the foot pedal and drop in the diaper. It's just that easy! While DG (Diaper Genie) has you finagling with a whole bunch of mechanics. It's too much work for a dirty diaper. My daughter poops like you have never seen, often filling her diaper to brim within seconds (No joke!)With this situation, sometimes I am not able to seal up the diaper for disposal and with the DD, it is not a problem because it has the same mechanics as a trash can. Disposing of the waste is simple to as it is already in its own trash bag. Plus, you can empty it at any time, you don't have to wait until it's busting full. To empty, just pull out the bag and cut it off with the hidden blade in the door, then knot the bag. Knot the liner in the unit and you're all set to go. Refills also last forever. With six months of use, I am still on my first refill pack (Bear in mind that my daughter goes through diapers like water!)!It is true that when you open the door and empty the unit, it does smell, but that's life! Diapers smell, that's all there is to it. But to help remedy the situation, place A small stick-it air freshener to the inside of the door and that should help a little. Someone wrote that they broke part of their foot on the pedal, although I cannot for the life of me imagine how. The pedal is small and only about 1"" x 2"". But in the same breath, it is possible to trip over anything that on the ground, so I do not believe that this is directly the DD's fault. On another note, this device can also be used to aid in catbox cleaning once you are done with all the diapers! Definetly an added bonus for all the cat owners out there! Overall, this the easiest product to handle and empty, hands down! ^_^"
154817,1,Overall great transaction. Arrived as advertised. The glider is comfortable... I wish it reclined back a little more.
111501,1,"I'm a homemaker, and have plenty of opportunities to directly breastfeed my son, so don't need to pump regularly, but this pump more than fits my needs. With my daughter I used an Avent manual, and the suction was sub-par. It got the job done, but barely, and I eventually just stopped pumping altogether. The lansinoh pump is easy to clean, assemble, and use. The suction is gentle, but strong; I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but the Avent pump would often hurt and pinch while I was using it, I found the Lansinoh pump much more comfortable, hence ""gentle"". I was concerned, given the low price of the pump, that I would be disappointed, but I'm really very happy with my purchase, and recommend it to anyone looking for a great manual pump!"
72066,2,"The rails work with my existing bed, the problem is they don't tell you that you have to have additional cross boards to support the mattress. In addition, once you place the cross boards on the rails, the mattress no longer is held in place, so I had to lower the supports on the rails to keep the mattress from sliding off the bed. Its a poor design. A lot of work had to be done to make these functional rails."
184188,1,"I love this. It's so great to have your stroller out of the way. Mine would always fly around in the back and break other things that I had in there with it, but now it stays put and no problems getting it in and out for our shopping trips. A must for the SUV owner!"
23336,1,"I really like the cute design of this mat, and for my purposes, it works well. I use it under a large bird cage as a floor protector. It washes well and lays well to allow the heavy cage wheels to move freely without the mat bunching up."
13461,1,"These have worked very well for us. We have power strips of a couple different sizes in our house, and this fits over all of them. It is large enough to cover all the bulky plugs we have plugged into the strips as well. I was surprised to read another reviewer found this too small. I think the cover should work for most single-wide power strips; it probably wouldn't work for a powerstrip with two rows of outlets. I found it relatively easy to open and close. I don't think my baby daughter will be able to open them herself, and she won't be able to reach her fingers in and shock herself. I now own at least five of these."
95014,1,"After renting an industrial/hospital pump (Symphony) for the first month after birth, we had low expectations for the Medela Swing Pump we purchased. We were pleasantly surprised at it's great functionality. The pumping power is actually comparable to the commercial pump, and it has a wide range of suction power. Also love that it works on either AC power or batteries. The only down side is that we had a double pump before, so it was more efficient to do both sides at once. Highly recommend the Medela Swing Breast Pump."
34422,1,"I highly recommend this product, is the only ointment that last all night plus is the only one that heal my baby's bottoms after just a couple of uses."
126501,2,"We have been using huggies little snugglers and loved them. Never a leak and never diaper rash. Well, I tried the snug and dry for size three and there were always droplets of moisture when I removed the diaper and my daughter was always red. I bought a pack of pampers today and the redness is already gone and she has been much happier being dry. The product just feels cheaply made. Very dissapointing"
47686,1,"Haven't tried washing it yet, but this is a lovely soft changing pad cover, which fits the contoured pad I have (I think a standard size) from Babies R Us."
102442,1,"My son loves this mobile, it is a bit quiet but still keeps his attention and he loves to watch the leaves and animals move around."
35501,1,"My husband looked at me as though I had 2 heads when I brought this home when our son was only a couple of months old. Now he loves it!! As any of us with babies know, they touch everything and put it, or their hands in their mouths.The floppy seat is great for grocery shopping, or if you enjoy dining out as we do, you can't beat it."
91340,0,We bought one of these and noticed that all it did was create static but we thought it had something to do with the fact that it was an open package so we got another one for my parent's house and it works just fine in fact the range of the monitor is so good it works between houses. The concept is a good one and I recommend this kind of monitor especially for new parents.
32007,2,"I am very dissapointed with this product, I would never buy something like this again, the feel of the sheet is absolutely not good or soft for the skin's baby. It's supposed to be 100% cotton but it really doesn't look like.I tried to washed with a very delicate soap but the result is the same. It is so rough to the touch. I don't plan to use it for my baby. Haven't even tried."
138962,1,My son is afraid of the dark so I did a lot of research on items like this. I decided on this turtle. It is wonderful! While it's not all plush - the shell is hard plastic - it truly lights up my son's bedroom. The yellow light isn't as bright but the blue and green lights are pretty bright. The lights stay on for 45 minutes which is a lot longer than other products. I was thrilled with this product and I'm seriously considering buying one for my bedroom just because I love having all the stars all over the ceiling!
158933,1,"My son was born 5 weeks early and suffered terribly with acid reflux. I tried other bottles, but these are what worked for us. These bottles cut down on the amount of air my son swallowed in. Less air swallowing meant less burps, which meant less spit up for us!The bottles are NOT EXTRA work, as some may have you to believe. I have 12 of them, and I simply pop ALL of the parts except the nipples into the dishwasher and everything comes clean with no residue! They are just as easy to clean as any other bottle.At 11 months, my son still uses them and refuses to give them up for his sipppy cups (but that is another issue...LOL)Dr. Brown's customer service is excellent too. When the inner tubing melted in the dishwasher, I emailed them and within a week I had a replacemnt tube sent to me for free."
77612,0,This tummy pad was so cute I just had to get it. My daughter played on it a few times but moved onto more interactive toys after a few weeks. It is great for tummy time but once they get tired of laying on their bellies this toy just gets shoved back in the bag. Did I mention it's adorable though?! Lol.
6452,0,Amazon had my exclusive business until they raised their prices. It is now much cheaper to either go to Costco or use a coupon at my local grocery store.
107611,0,"If I had it to do over again I wouldn't have made this purchase... mainly because there is nothing on this swing to entertain a child other than the LOUD whir of the motor! Yes, the adjustable height is great but not worth the exchange of having something to engage and entertain the child... Maybe the other model with an attachable toy section would have been a better investment! My daughter does love this swing however and takes her morning and afternoon naps in it, in the reclined position!"
72686,1,"This is the only nipple my son likes on the bottles he gets while I am at work. He is breastfed all the rest of the time. If you are breast feeding, only offer stage one nipples so baby gets a slower flow like mom's nipple. Exclusively breastfed babies dont increase volume of milk at the rate of a formula fed baby because breast milk changes composition as baby's dietary needs change so this will be the only nipple size you need.I would not stock up on any brand of bottle/nipple before your baby is born. Wait to see which your (breast milk OR formula fed) baby likes first."
31114,1,"I bought this for my 2.5 y.o. and 3 month old. I love it! My 2.5 y.o. still prefers to walk, but hopefully soon, he'll want to ride on it. It's very lightweight and I like the bright color, makes it easy to find in a crowd. The canopy covers both kids too. Two downfalls, it is a bit difficult to get stuff in and out of the basket (but it can be done) underneath and when I use the car seat, my 2.5 y.o. cannot sit on the seat behind because the seat in front tilts too far back. He has to stand when using the car seat.The other thing that I did not do (even though I read someone's else's review about it), is measure my trunk! It does not fit (because of the canopy) in a VW Passat or a Honda Civic trunk, but luckily it does fit into a 2002 Ford Taurus."
103096,0,"My daughter seems to really enjoy the freedom of this bath seat. I on the other hand found it a little difficult to clean certain areas on my daughter. Also, If you have a textured tub don't expect the suction cups to work."
153,1,Pampers have been the best diapers for us to use on our little boy. We haven't had any issues with them leaking and he can sure fill them up during the night. I highly recommend these diapers.
104024,0,"Maybe this should've been obvious, but the smell of this product is not for men. It has a flowery/perfume smell. I was looking for a product for chafing that didn't smell like baby powder, but the scent of this product is really not preferable. The scent is strong and too sweet smelling for me.I've found that using corn starch and baking soda mixed together is a good, unscented alternative for those that don't like scents (seems that all of the unscented versions have been discontinued..)."
48294,2,"For us it lasted almost two years, so I suppose we're supposed to be happy. Though at almost two hundred dollars back in 2010, it still feels like we didn't get our money's worth. Now they want us to pay $80 for a refurbished unit with a six-month warranty. The process for getting the replacement is pretty streamlined, but that should tell you something about HOW MANY of their products break once outside the warranty period.***July 2012 update -- now the refurb unit is mostly broken. Lasted five months."
81584,0,I've had this monitor for 3 months now and the sound is good as far as I can hear my son breathe through it BUT it has a lot of static and picks up phone conversations from others in our neighborhood.
158804,1,"My son is 7 month old and I bought size medium. It is perfect since there is still room for his feet and it will still fit when he is 1 year old. I like it mostly because the zipper goes the other way, no need to think about baby trying to snatch the Zipper head or put it in his mouth.It is 100% cotton, does not shrink in the dryer. go for it.So to give an idea about sizes, my baby is 28 inches tall and medium size fits perfect.I love it and so does my baby."
103334,1,I read all of the other reviews that said the latch will break and we have not had a problem yet!! A neighbor with the same gate had it last about 2 years before the latch broke. I bought it anyway because it was one of few that would fit our opening. Aside from the questionable latch this gate is as good or better that any other gate I have seen. It is a little awkward for one handed use but it can be done. It latches closed very easily and securely. Our 2 year old knows where the latch is but cannot operate it herself.
35639,1,"After seeing somebody with the petunia pickle bottom, I knew I needed a diaper bag that can convert into a backpack if needed. But when I found out the price, I just couldn't afford it so I was on the search for something similar. That's how I found this bag. I got it at a really good price and more than half of what the petunias cost. I love this bag. It fits everything and still small and compacted. I love that there is a separate section for the diapers and wipes and changing pad. I don't have to go thru all the other stuff to get to it. Which makes it easier to do with one hand if you need. I've used it for over 2 years and still great. I just recently had another baby and received the petunia bag as a gift and I just love this one so much more. It's not as stiff, not as heavy and just easier to carry. I used the petunia for 2 months and now i've switched back to my bumble. I just don't think I can ever part with this bag. Its definitely, my first love."
111691,1,"I used them for a while then switched to pampers and were terrible at least for my daugter(read my review about them), we got back on ""huggies track"".I wish they had flaps in the front because they get a little tight when baby is about to move to the next size, and by that I also mean that sizes are a little smaller than what's indicated in package."
29352,1,I love this lamp!!!We purchased this lamp in 2007 along with the rest of the set.The lamp feels solid and the details are just adorable.I loved the complete set soo much that when my second daughter was born I kept the room with the same decor.I love my Snug as a Bug set!!
59623,2,"I wish I read the reviews on this product before I bought it. My 11 month old daughter also loves to pull off the foam. Not only did I waste money but I wasted a lot of time purchasing, installing and running over to my daughter hoping she doesn't pull a piece off and choke on it.If I could rate this product with 0 stars, I would.Update 12/07 - my son who is now almost 3 had the same issues with this product. The glue has left such a mess on our fireplace and I'm still trying to get the glue off. HORRIBLE PRODUCT."
133351,0,"I purchased these thinking they were the glass ones (they come up under ""glass baby bottle"" when searched) so without really reading I assumed they were glass since they came up under the search for glass baby bottles. So for those of you who did the same, these are not glass."
136547,1,"The dresser took about a week to receive, and I was worried about the pieces since it was a heavy package and looked like it got a little beat up in the process. When we opened the box, it was well packed and everything was in tact :) it took a while to put together but the instructions are easy to follow, (it was just a lot to assemble.) it went together pretty easy without complications. It looks great, and is perfect for baby clothes/ things. (I'm not sure how sturdy the drawers will be with heavier clothes, they do seem a little flimsy on the bottom, but we will see) Overall we are very pleased with the dresser/ tower.*my only complaint is that the shelves in the tower are not adjustable. (unless you drill your own holes into the sides)"
47583,1,"Arrived much sooner than promised; extremely easy to set up. Perfect for the new baby; allows ease of access at night feedings. Efficient, compact, and convenient. My daughter loves it! I would recommend this product; a great value."
28025,0,"ok got this for my 6 month old and she loves it, it is easy to move around in and the animals are great also, but it didn't come with the zebra teething ring that is shows on the box or in the picture so be carefull on that. other than the missing pc. the product does what it is supposed to do."
139420,1,"We got this when our twin girls were babies...at the time it seemed useless. We started using it every night when they were about 2 1/2. They absolutely loved it and asked for it every night. While the amber is impossible for us to see unless it's very dark, the green and blue are beautiful. The girls are six now, and we have had the turtle on every night since we started using it - and they still ask for it every night! I like the auto-off feature, and the buttons are easy enough that if one of the kids wakes up in the middle of the night, she can turn the turtle back on by herself if she wants it."
164360,1,"These diapers are great! We've only had a couple ""accidents"" when there have been major explosions. They also hold up very well for the 11-12 hours my 10-month-old sleeps during the night. I highly recommend these diapers, especially at the Amazon discounted price."
29441,2,"The first description says that this valance is longer than it actually is. The color is not true at all. The entire valance was one color purple, there was not a darker color at the bottom as the picture shows. Sent it back!"
108949,1,"With only one month into using this mattress, there seems that it's holding up to what I had expected. We will know better as time goes on."
29644,1,"I haven't had a chance to hang these up yet, but I'll assume they'll look just as cute as the picture. All coordinates to the bedding seemed reasonably priced. So I bought everything that matched. Before getting on Amazon, I couldn't find any nursery stuff with dragonflies on it."
171291,1,"Perfect for infants. Our baby was in this for 9 months. The sling was perfect for the first month until his cord fell off, then the seats were wonderful. I wouldn't call it infant to toddler, because a toddler would would be way too big to fit comfortably, but it is great for the first while. I was very satisfied with our purchase."
94170,1,"I love this jumper! Both of my kids got a lot of use out of it, enjoyed it immensely, but also got there fingers slammed on more than one occassion between the large, hard tray and the door jam."
86022,2,"I had to buy a new $20 battery after one year of life, then the sound won't work, and if it is working sometimes, you also have a very loud hum. What a waste. The camera doesn't stay in place, just flops all the way down. Piece of junk. My baby was screaming and I didn't hear a thing on the moniter."
163646,1,"Easy to clean. Easy to adjust. Safe and secure. Travels easily if you have the room (it doesn't fold down to the size of a walnut for you nit-picky people who are never satisfied) Seemly comfortable for my boy. Wish they made them in my size. If your child is a wiggley creature you can strap him or her down with the shoulder straps but you can also take them out and leave the belt strap if you have a nice calm baby. Also, the bugs are super cute."
119453,1,"I'm a first time mom, have been using this pillow for about 6 weeks now. I like everything about this pillow, its firm and sturdy ..good for baby's back. I sometime leave the baby sleeping on her side ( pref left) for about 5 minutes after feeding so that it helps the baby in digestion, i would have not been to that with other softer pillows. The back support is excellent, makes it easy for me to maintain the posture while breastfeeding.Am happy with this purchase."
126514,1,I tried several brands of diapers when my daughter was born and Huggies has been the best. We have never had an overflow and she can sleep up to 8 hours at night and her diaper still never leaks. This is our favorite brand!
159499,1,"I absolutely love this bouncer. I looked at alot of bouncers and found this one to be the cutest. My very fussy newborn loves it. She used to cry all of her waking moments but now she is like a different baby and I believe this bouncer made the difference. She loves looking at the fishes and starfish, and the vibrations really calm her down. Some reviewers have said the bubbles are noisy, but I find the sound very pleasing and baby likes it. The music that it comes with is very nice also. This aqaurium bouncer is the best thing I own and I highly recommend it for very fussy babies."
65520,1,My wife and I have recently moved to the shore area in Massachusetts and immediately began looking for one of these sport strollers for the beach. I considered several models and eventually settled on this one partly because we are planning on having another child. Assembly of this model was a snap and the framework is of a very solid construction. My son enjoys his rides and I do as well. The wheels provide a smooth ride over the bumpiest of terrains. It was well worth the buy!
134275,1,"I would of never thought I needed one of theses until my newborn what hold her breath when It came to wiping her with a cold wipe. So I went out my way to find a good one of these online, as they don't really sell them in stores. I finally picked this one. It works perfect. I am glad I got it for her and she no longer is bothered by the wipes."
145731,1,"We bought this for our 4 month old grandson. He absolutely loves this. At first, he could barely touch his toes to the floor but now he can and he flies around with it and amuses himself with all the colorful toys attached."
137364,1,"This is my 3rd pregnancy and my first with this pillow. Much, much better than the conventional body pillows. I love how it curves around your back because it keeps me from rolling onto my back in the middle of the night and supports my lower back. I put a flat regular pillow under my head also to boost my head up a little bit which helps be breath better."
17901,0,"It is the correct panels, however they ar very hard to open and close unlike the rest of the gate. Don;t know if it is because its an extension or just these particular panels?"
128147,1,"We've used this stroller for any long event since last August. Our toddler has the choice to sit, stand, face us, turn around, etc. The only inconvenient factor is that there isn't a great recline postion for the baby in the front(to sleep), like that of our Evenflo stroller. It's lightweight, easy to pack, and compact."
50228,2,"Not only did the product get delivered 3 days later than expected, my child's grandfather who is in the construction industry installed the seat and the entire set broke off of the bowl the first time anyone sat on it. And nobody in this household is overweight."
91968,1,I love the Boppy pregnancy pillow. It relieves the pressure between the knees while holding up your belly at the same time.
4435,1,I bought many of these frames to give as baby shower favors. They are perfect.
79857,2,"I got this item because it indicated it could protect my paper from my cat. Unfortunately, it is a total failure in this regard. I added some pics to show how easily the cat tore up the roll and I'm returning this thing.It also looks pretty unsanitary. People will have to handle the spring loaded cover each time they want paper. I'm not into spraying this thing down with lysol every time I need to use it.There must be a better way!"
54405,0,"I fell in love with this mobile, especially do to the remote feature (which I rarely used). When we received it from our registry, we installed it, and my son loved it. Then trouble started....it really didn't fit our crib properly, the arm never stayed in the same place (it seems too heavy for the unit). The final straw was when the arm would fall off and hit the baby. I returned the unit, thinking it was a lemon. When we brought the new mobile home, it started again. I called Tiny Love, who said they were getting complaints, and sent me a new, improved arm. It does work now."
36658,2,"i thought about getting one of these for our son--until i saw his cousin nearly stand up in a high chair while still ""buckled"" in. i opted instead to get one that more securely attaches to its intended surroundings. doesn't do much good to strap your kid to the floppy seat if no part of it or the kid is actually strapped to the frame."
162010,0,"I will admit, I read the instructions and was still an idiot and didn't lock that middle thing down. Anyway, after I figured that out, it worked great....for about 2 months. Now it leaks enough that I put a towel underneath it while bathing my 13 week old. It's not bad enough that I feel I need to get a new one, but if we have another, I will probably get a different tub."
48408,0,"This hadheld monitor has great audio, sound much much better than any other monitor I have purchased. But I don't know how they could call this a color screen monitor. There is vertually no color even during the day. Picture gets scrambled when the phone rings or sometimes it's hard to find a signal. Over all it's nice to be able to see my daughter instead of just hearing her. Save your money and buy one of the black and whites video moitors"
134519,0,"Cleaning my son with warm wipes was something I felt was important to his comfort. Ever have someone put cold lotion on your back? Yah. So I buy the warmer that seemed to score highest on the ratings, which was not that many at the time. It does its job of keeping the wipes warm and moist. But it promises to not brown the bottom wipes. And it does anyway. I end up throwing out the bottom dozen wipes due to dryness and browning. Personal preference; I would have chose another brand."
40694,0,"My son is currently 14 months old. When he was a newborn, we used pampers swaddlers and when he was ready for the size threes, we decided to use pampers cruisers since they had the same absorb away liner in them that we loved. When I recently received another box of cruisers in the mail, I was disappointed to discover that the liner was missing. After calling the company, I found out that unfortunately, pampers has chosen to get rid of the absorb away liner in their cruisers and put out a new line of ""Pampers Cruisers Premium Absorbency"" available at Target. While using the box of the new style of cruisers my son developed the first diaper rash of his life despite frequent changes. These diapers are not as good as they were previously and I really wish that the company would go back to the old style. Needless to say, I am searching for a new diaper."
138190,1,It lights the room perfectly at night while my daughter is coasting down. Choosing between 3 different colors of lights each night is fun. It cuts off after 15-20 minutes. We've had it for 2 months and no battery change yet.
57339,0,"This item is super cute and is true to the photo, however, it is by far not a soft item. The fabric is fairly rough, even after washing in Dreft several times. For that reason we haven't used it much. I would recommend purchasing a different, softer item."
29821,1,"I love this stuff. For a while I was seduced by other kinds of ointment and paste, but this is the only one for me. The stuff in the blue tube is very much a paste, and that is what it feels like when you are trying to wipe your kid's behind.Stick with this ointment, it protects their soft skin from diaper rash (I am vigilant about changing the diaper right away, but if they poop while sleeping or are teething, then bad things happen no matter how fast you are) AND it wipes off easily.I only wish Amazon.com sold the 1-pound tub. It is a terrific value and perfect to have at your diaper changing station."
37701,1,"I absolutely love these place mats! I got hte US, the worldview map and outspace map. We have these at our table each night. We are americans and live in Singapore and my husband travels a lot. So its great to use the maps to discuss where we live, where we've been, where we're going etc. I've taken them to restaurants too to entertain my son. great gift I think too"
117907,1,"This item worked great for my Dr. Brown's bottles. We tried many different ones, and this was the best."
100678,1,"The word ""used"" looked odd, but the fact is that only the box had a dent, the diapers inside were as good as the ""New"" ones."
109149,1,"We bought a Bumbo seat with our 3rd child and loved it. The trays were just starting to come out when he was outgrowing it. I had always said that I wish I had owned the tray. We had our daughter this year and I bought a tray. It is great since I feed her in the Bumbo seat. The only down side is that it is kinda tough to put the tray on and lock it into place. I have thought I had it on and discovered that I didn't a couple of times. It is also handy to have for putting toys on so she can play. Since we have our almost 2 year old in the high chair, this is a great alternative for meal times. If you own a Bumbo seat, I would go ahead and get the tray. It is very reasonably priced as well."
13049,1,"I would never install a car seat without the Mighty-Tite. I found this product after buying 4 different car seats (none that we felt were installed tight enough.) We always tighten the car seat manually (as much as possible) before using the Mighty-Tite. We protect our truck seats with a rag where the Mighty-Tite comes in contact with the seat. We have leather seats and have never had any problems or anticipate any. The best feature of the Mighty-Tite: We feel our toddler is safe, whether it's in our vehicles or someone else's."
19896,2,"these suck because they don't suck for long. They worked at first but time has proved, getting a cheaper regular bowl would suffice."
6515,1,"These are great diapers, but not at the new price of $10.49. They were great at $7.49, but they're now cheaper at Target, Sams and many other places, even with tax!!"
107164,1,"Its a good product because its easy to use, and you don't need the expensive refillable bags like the Diaper Genie. However, it doesn't do so good of a job hiding the smell. We'd spray the inside with Lysol disenfectant, but if we waited for the bag to fill up to capacity our room would be full of the dirty diaper smell. So that's the only reason I give it a 4 stars.Its easy to use, and inexpensive when it comes to the refills. Just doesn't mask the smell of dirty diapers that well."
150643,1,"We spent big money on all of her other furniture. This was the last piece we purchased and didn't want to spend as much. However, we didn't want something ""cheap"" looking either. We ordered the oak color, which is beautiful. We were very impressed that it arrived packaged so well. Double layered and not a scratch on the box. The quality is good, all of the pieces were there, and my husband had it put together in 2-3 hours. It matches her other furniture perfectly. The drawers do fit a lot, but I wish they were deeper. The drawers are not as deep as they look in the picture, the wood paneled fronts just make it look that way. The top is very spacious and roomy enough to fit a nice sized lamp, CD player, and picture frames. All in all, for the price, I highly recommend. I was very nervous purchasing a furniture product online, but I am glad that we did. For the money we spent, it's good quality and perfect for her nursery."
116151,1,"I bought this high chair after much research, and after owning a Baby Trend model.Pros: Easy to clean, much more sanitary, cool looking design, comes with two snap-on tray liners.Cons: Brakes don't work very well, tray is too small, shoulder straps are too easy to get out of, snap-in ""buckle"" falls right where tray rests against baby's belly, main tray is not dishwasher safe, tray liners do not cover entire tray (so you have to wash it every time anyway).Neutral: Though the pneumatic lift is a cool idea, as a mother who doesn't adjust the height of her high chair, I found it kind of silly and useless.Even though it appears from my review that the ""cons"" outweigh the ""pros"", I still give this chair 4 out of 5 stars simply because of how clean you can get it! You can take even the straps off and throw them in the washer. Plus, when your kid is in it, he looks like he's piloting a spaceship!"
165741,1,Great product at a great price plus free shipping! Doesn't get any better than that! I have worked in daycare for 11years now and still claim pampers to be the best brand out there for diapers and wipes!P.S. I'm also a mom:)
33597,1,"This gate is easy to use and ""remembers"" how you had it set. Light and great functionality... I can step over it but my puppy can't.."
164559,2,"OK, this is the first review I have ever written for Amazon and I order most of my baby's things through the site. I just got back back from walking around the grocery store with baby poop smeared on my shirt because of these silly diapers. We've been using Swaddlers since birth but for some reason, between size 3 and 4, we switched to Baby Dry... He's never had many issues peeing through diapers during the night or #2 blow-outs but we've had something happen everyday with these diapers. Today's blow-out on the way home from work was the final straw. They do not fit as snugly around his thighs, and I think that may be causing the leaking issues. During the night, the pee soaks through the top on the front. He's a pretty thick baby so I'm blaming the diapers!I am switching back to Swaddlers Sensitive today."
160545,2,"I registered for, and received two of these crib sheets...they were highly recommended by friends who had babies. I recently washed them in preparation of our son's arrival and to my horror, after a single wash, they are already coming apart. The plastic side has many small tears, which will only get worse with wear and additional washings. I followed the washing instructions exactly, used Dreft and dried on low heat just until the sheet was no longer damp. I'm pretty dissapointed and afraid to see how long they last."
127050,0,"In my small apartment, this box was way too big. The picture made it seem smaller. Not the biggest issue though...The diapers themselves are great with minimal leaks."
159071,2,"I have gone through 2 of these: the first one didn't work right out of the box. Went thru the trouble of calling the company to exchange it (very efficient customer service - I think Summer Infant must have done this before considering the poor quality of the product), and the new one lasted just a few weeks before running into the same problem. Both times, the parent side of the monitor will not run off of the power cord, only battery power, which lasts only 2 hours before emitting a loud ""low battery"" alarm. Other cons: the power buttons are not obvious and so your mother or baby sitter won't be able to figure out how to turn it on. The monitors are so flimsy that they won't even stand up on their own, the weight of the cord will pull them over. The sound quality is decent but not great and there is a lot of static. I am not going to bother sending back the second broken monitor because the product is just not worth the trouble, and I have had enough headaches over this stupid thing. I had to go out to the drug store late at night to buy a replacement for this monitor and the cheap-o one I got there has lasted for 9 months now with no problem!"
125832,0,"I never have as much luck with the Huggies as I have with the Pampers... any of their products. That said, these were cheaper and for my purposes that makes them better. We use them for the occasional accident while sleeping. My 3yr old only wears them at night and most of the time wakes up dry... if I needed the diaper/pullup to ""work"" well ... I'd go back to Pampers."
17674,1,"I was looking for a small stroller that offered the big stroller option, after searching I found this one, it's great, you can't beat the price. it has a nice storage basket that holds more then it looks, it lays back for napping, has a decent canopy, buckles up easily, folds compactly, and even has a carry handle. I really love this stroller but the few things I would like to change would be the canopy doesn't block the sun as much as I would like it to."
14543,0,"I'll admit it - I have to laugh when I read some of these reviews, both the good and bad. There is no need to overthink what bottle you use to feed your baby. If you try this one and she accepts the nipple, go with it. If she rejects it, try another bottle. These bottles are no better or worse than any other.All babies experience some degree of gas and spitting up. Do you really think a &quot;special&quot; bottle is going change what has been happening since the dawn of time?Regarding the leakage problem discussed by others, just make sure the top is tight and you will be fine. I experienced leakage one time and ever since, I have made sure to tighten the top before giving it to my daughter. No more problems.Relax, parents. Your baby needs you to spend less time overthinking everything and more time holding, cuddling, playing, etc. with her."
43717,1,I have the older style hands free First Years gate and was a little concerned if this would fit but it fits perfectly and my gosh it really makes a difference. The gate fit our hallway before the extension but the supports were almost all the way extended so when we saw that the extension was only 15.00 we decided to give it a go.I do not know how we lived without it. It used to be kinda wobbly and I found myself tightening it every few days. I have not had to tighten it since we bought this extension. I is sooooooooooooooooo much sturdier.
11529,2,I'm glad I've got it on sale!!!!! It just doesn't make any sense and doesn't serve any purpose!!!!!!!!! Horrible design not thought through I WILL NEVER EVER RECOMMEND IT!!!!
151218,2,"My daughter liked this sling (we have the blue version), but I found it uncomfortable. I have one shoulder that is messed up so I thought I could put her on the other shoulder. The problem was that it was very bulky and hard to adjust. I am small and my daughter is thin, for a baby anyway - no rolls, so I had to tighten it all the way and it still didn't feel right. I have found another kind with only fabric and a loop, meaning I could tighten it to fit a barbie in there! It's called something like a maya wrap and there are usually distributors in your area."
150884,1,"This hutch is definitely worth the price!!! It is a beautiful piece that will be used for many years, not only as baby furniture, but as a bookshelf and storage cabinet for toys, clothes, etc. There is ample storage and is very effective at keeping things within hands reach and organized during changings and just in general. I would recommend this to anyone, but there are a few things that I wish I would have known before buying it.1. My biggest complaint is the color. I have antique cherry furniture and modern cherry furniture, and this cherry hutch does not match any of my other cherry pieces. It has a deep purple hue to it, closer to an eggplant color. There are many different colors of cherry, but if you are looking for something closer to Brazilian cherry hardwood floor, this is NOT going to match.2. The doors, drawer fronts, and several trim pieces are the only solid wood pieces. The rest is veneered particle board. That being said, this piece was engineered very well. It does not feel flimsy like other particleboard furniture I have purchased and assembled. For example, the drawer bottoms are set into dadoes, not just nailed to the bottom of the drawers.3. The drawer slide rollers do not line up well with the predrilled holes on the bottom of the drawers, and strip out easily with even a little too much pressure. Solution is to predrill your own holes for the drawer slides and use extreme caution when tightening the screws.4. If the tower is used and attached to the hutch, the standard size changing pad does NOT fit properly. The lower shelf of the tower has to be left off as well.Overall, we are very satisfied with this furniture."
35138,1,Unlike the other reviews I had no problems. My unit was shipped within a week of purchase and all of the parts where intact. We put it togther in less than an hour and it is a very beautiful piece.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
158451,0,"I love the border and the way it looks in my son's room however, it says on the package it is supposed to stick on the wall once it's wet. It had NO sticky stuff on the back whatsoever! We had to go buy paste from Lowe's to make it stick. So the label was a little misleading. But the end product is adorable and my son loves it!"
16711,0,"We registered and received this toy for our son. Overall this is an attractive toy, but due to alot of use, we typically had to replace the batteries every other week. Also, the mat is not lined and we had to provide some additional padding for comfort. I would not purchase this toy for my child or for any other child."
102683,2,"I was very excited to get this mobile and we were so disappointed when it didn't turn. The music played as advertised but I think the leaves were too heavy for the little battery powered motor. It rotated only until the part where the leaves were supposed to lift up and then it stopped. I would give this 5 stars for color and cuteness, but only 2 for music quality and 0 for the fact that it doesn't work at all.Too bad."
82681,1,"I recently purchased this item for my granddaughter, I love that it soft and cuddly. I like the soothing sounds that helps her fall asleep."
130542,0,"This swing is wonderful and we have had it about a year, but it's not as convenient as our rainforest swing was with our first child. The Ocean Wonders swing does not have the option for the mobile to lift up while placing baby in or taking out of the crib. I actually miss that feature a lot. My only other complaint is that it's a bit on the noisy side compared to other swings. Our second baby actually does better with lots of noise, but this swing would not have worked with our sound-sensitive toddler when she was a newborn!"
34684,1,"All I can say is that most of the people with the bad reviews must have had very bad luck with this product... the sterilizer was handed down to me by my sister; she lend it to a sister-in-law after she finished using it with her third child, and then I got it for my first son and now my second one is using it. I even think the sister-in-law used it with her first son too, that would make this the 7th baby used with, anyway, it's still working!"
85124,0,"I ordered this pillow as soon as I found out I was pregnant. At first it was wonderful! Now, 7 1/2 months later, it's only so-so. The stuffing of the pillow has gone almost totally flat. And since there is no return on this item I'm stuck with it. So for the price, I would have been better off buying a bunch of $2 pillows from Walmart and surrounding myself with them."
107351,1,"As a nanny, I used many different diaper pails. Now I have my own child I decided to give this one a try. I like the design, the fact that I can use regular trash bags and also that I can use it for cloth diapers which we switched to after a couple of weeks. This is by far my favorite diaper pail. It is cost effective due to using regular bags and it does the job well."
140014,1,Love the gate. It fits the doorway perfectly and looks very nice. My little dogs can see through it but cannot get over it. It looks nicer than a plastic gate and is low enough I don't break my neck getting over it. I love that you are able to fold it up for easy storage and it can be adjusted to different lengths. Well worth every penny.
13025,2,"Owned one of these several years ago, and the quality has gone down drastically on the newer models. The wood is more flimsy. Can't lock the width in place. Bought one of these recently and tried to tighten it snugly in a doorway, and the wooden lever snapped in two. I had to throw it away the same day I received it. Cheap plastic grate. If you have base boards, this won't fit because the width between the base boards is different than the width between the walls higher up. Also, everytime you take the gate down, you lose the place of the width you had selected. If you don't want to go to the hassle of taking the gate down, you have to climb over it, and that becomes a pain. Would recommend one of the more expensive metal gates that can open without having to remove the gate. You get what you pay for. Nuff said. Don't expect this gate to last."
78584,1,"The Car Seat Travel Accessory made our trip so much easier! After reading the reviews, most of which were good, we decided that it was worth a shot, and at such a low price, it really was. It arrived almost immediately after we ordered it, so we had plenty of time to test it out before we had to use it. It was very easy to attach while at home. When we got to the airport it was still easy to attach, but I think the pressure of having to be somewhere made it a little more time consuming. Once it was attached to our luggage, it was smooth sailing. Some reviews stated that it damaged luggage, but we did not have that problem. We did not leave our child in the car seat, as he had just sat in it for 3 hours and was about to sit in it for four more. The security checkpoint did slow us down, as we had to detach the car seat then reattach it after security. But in reality, it only took about a minute or so to reattach it. Sidenote: make sure you don't need to get anything out of the suitcase you are attaching the car seat to! On our way back from our vacation, we did give our child a ride in the car seat while it was attached to the luggage and it worked great! So much easier than carrying him or having him lag behind us. He loved it too! We got a few comments about what a great invention that little strap was, and we agree. This is a great product and we would recommend it to anyone who needs to travel with a car seat."
119449,1,I wish I had known how great this pillow was with my first baby! Now that I know how wonderful this pillow is I know that I suffered with my first child using the boppy. The boppy would constantly slip off and this stays in place thanks to the belt. It's also so firm that it holds the baby up very well. I can nurse my son in many different positions easily. It also gives great back support! The only problem I have and it's no fault of the pillow is that I had to wait a few weeks before I could use it because I had a c-section and it put too much pressure on my stomach as did the boppy. This is a great investment and I would recommend it to anyone!!
79132,1,Bought this for my neighbor boy to put up in his room...he loved it. Hasn't put it up yet...but will after they've re-painted his room.
100105,1,"I only buy Pampers brand diapers, they're the best. There's a reason we call diapers 'pampers' !!!"
18417,1,I bought 3 sets of these bottles for my two grandsons. The first had collic & it helped him. The second has acid reflux & the Dr. recommened when he saw what type bottle he was on to keep him on them. I wish they had been available when my two boys were born.Thanks Mrs.K
138182,1,MY OLDEST GRANDDAUGHTER WILL LOVE THIS ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WHEN SHE SHINES IT ON THE CEILING OF HER ROOM IN WICH SHE SLEEPS ON THE TOP BUNK.
163180,1,"This is the 5th stroller I've tried since adding twins to my family. And I've finally found the one! It is great. It is easy to load and unload, it has trays and plenty of leg room for the little ones. And as an added bonus, my ""small sized"" preschooler can also ride on the back of this stroller similar to the sit n' stands. I'm trying to get my husband to build her a little shelf to stand on, but it hasn't happened yet, she just stands on the axel and off we go. It's easy to steer, lighter than any other I tried and the stadium seating is nice too. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there is not a cup holder and the huge (positive!) basket is a little hard to get to. But overall, it gets the job done easily!"
31101,1,"We love our Joovy Ultra Lite. I have a three year old and an eight month old and we have used it since our eight month old was born. I love that it is not too heavy for a double stroller and easy to collapse and set up. It has gone to the beach, to the zoo, on walks, and both kids love it. My 3 year old loves that he can get on and off when he wants. I also love the parent organizer- tons of space for keys, cell phone and drinks. It's the perfect stroller for a toddler and a baby!"
141997,2,Followed the directions but the adhesive just isn't sticky enough. Good idea but horrible product. I are turning this today.
133177,2,"I have 4 kids 5 and under and this is my third diaper disposal system. I switched from the Diaper Genie two because I thought the refills would be a little cheaper and with two in diapers, I'm all about cheap. After 3 months of trying to pretend it was working, I'm going to have to end this relationship. It just stinks, folks. Even with an air freshener in the container, my whole bathroom and room smells like dirty diapers. I am smelling them in my sleep. I cannot figure out how this pail is any different than a regular trashcan with a foot petal. Bottom line is, it's not. The Diaper Genie contained the smell AND I was able to shove in way more diapers. I'm sad I wasted my money on this. And I hate admitting I'm wrong. But this product is goin' in the garage sale!"
14724,2,"I bought and asked for tons of &quot;Avent&quot; Bottles and they worked horribly for me and my son wouldnt eat from them and cried constantly. I even had spent $60 on the &quot;Isis breats pump&quot; which was worthless. These bottles would not release when my son was eating, so only when he starting crying because he was fed up, did air go through the nipple and let the formula come down so he could eat. I think, one of the best and honestly, more practical, things to do is buy one type of bottle of each one you think is good, then once the baby is born see what works best with them. It will save you a lot of trouble in the end, because Dont take anyone's word for certain bottles or &quot;cures&quot; for your baby - in time you'll know and understand your son's or daughter's needs."
155392,1,"I use this for our Graco Pack N Play and it fits perfectly. It is extremely soft, I ordered another one!"
175397,1,"Best money I've spent has been on this item. Great for travel as the tube deflates and fits in luggage. I will buy this for any expectant mother from here on out. I believe my LO sat and builds her core muscles better with this item. if she falls, she falls into a air pillow that props her right back up. this is great!"
69190,1,My 3 year old is very tall for his age and not potty trained just yet. So happy there is a diaper size for him!
83263,1,"I love this Graco stroller for all the mommy-friendly features and the fact that this model is lighter than most. It folds a sits upright is a compact fashion when not in use.UPDATE: 19 months later and this stroller is going strong and still looks great. No damage, brakes work, steering is still excellent. Most importantly, it has grown with our child from newborn to toddler and I didn't have to remove any bassinet attachments or buy new pieces to size it up (unlike those $1200 jobs!)"
125281,0,"The light blue one is all one piece of silicon. My 6 month old doesn't love it, and really won't even use it. I'll update it if he takes it up in the next year."
149764,1,"Pros: Fits great in compact cars (like my VW Jetta), comfortable, easy to put together.Cons: The back to the booster seat doesnt snap in well. So if its moved even just a little bit it falls apart.Over all my son loves it and is comfortable in it. So I love it too."
163293,2,"This thing is too big for what it accomplishes. It could be much more compact. JJ Cole makes a better, smaller one."
97492,1,We bought this for use in a second vehicle for our Eddie Bauer Adventurer Infant Carrier. Works Great! No complaints!!!!
4129,1,My wife and I have been through several food choppers that cost less but this one works far better than cheaper units. It's three blade design chops food more quickly than the two blade units. It is mostly dishwasher safe which was not the case with our other choppers. I should also mention that the product arrived on time and in good condition.
123743,2,"We received this mat for our shower along with the Baby Einstein playmat. At 8 weeks old my son LOVES the Baby Einstein mat - he lays on it smiling away, kicking his feet and waving his arms while he stares at the toys. On the Flutterbye mat, he just lays there.Here's the problem. The toys hang too high for him to reach them to activate the bird. When I lowered them they hit him in the head and since they're made of hard plastic (or have hard plastic components on them) it made him cry. The bird also hangs too low. My son has to be pretty much right under it, then he can't reach the toys to activate it. I have to position him with his feet by the base of the bar so he can kick the bars to get it moving. The bird is just not very interesting to him, its movement is pretty jerky and it's just not flashy enough to keep his attention. He usually cries after about 5 minutes on this mat, while the Baby Einstein mat keep him happy for 30 mintues or more. Also, the bird hangs low enough that in order for him to be able to see it, I have to put him close enough that he can get the bird with his hands and the bird comes off pretty easily.One plus to this mat is it has lots of neat extras on the actual mat, making it a bit more fun for tummy time. Still, I wouldn't suggest this play mat if you have an active and hard to entertain baby."
130104,1,"Our 17-month old daughter loved this swing when she was little!! Now we're expecting her little brother in a couple of months and cannot wait to use it again! The side-to-side and front-to-back options are GREAT!! The music is very soothing. The mini carousel of sea animals are adorable and definitely bring attention to the little illuminated aquarium up top! When the little one is older, the tray with the bright beads will add additional entertainment as well! Everything about this is so stimulating for Baby's development! All the Ocean Wonders products are terrifc and we have most of them! This is a GREAT, GREAT swing!!!"
117852,1,Very pleased easy for toddle to sit and an not fall out this is my daughters dinner table and coloring table and she loves it. Lots of pieces to assemble but not difficult. Easy to clean for most part- but could potentially scratch. Seems to be made well- very heavy
170183,1,"We researched cribs for a few months before narrowing it down to 3 choices. This was one of them and by far the cheapest, especially from this website. We received the crib one week after we ordered it (with free shipping). It took about 45 minutes to put together and is really a beautiful and sturdy crib. The only drawback I see is that the wood dents fairly easily. I hit one of the pieces against another piece when we were putting it together and it left a small but obvious indention in both pieces. But for the price, it's the best crib out there and I would definitely recommend it."
112983,0,"Darling little printed sheets and comforter which look great, but they were not as soft and snuggly as I expected them to be for the price. I feel like I could have gone to Target and spent $30 to get something very similar. Softness has improved a bit after some washings but colors have already faded a bit too."
6767,0,"what happened?? pampers cruisers changed their long time staple diapers, and definitely NOT for the better. my son is getting diaper rash for the first time EVER, and they just aren't as absorbent."
172958,0,"Unscented Huggies Wipes are the best for both of us...Baby seems to like them, doesn't fuss a bit. I think they feel great, the feel of some of the other brands makes my skin crawl (have tried many brands thru the years). Huggies clean the baby completely, and in my opinion they are just about the right size and strength. We use less Huggies wipes than we did with other brands. Unscented is a necessity as my skin is allergic to EVERYTHING (fortunately, Baby's isn't).Also use them to clean up after my cats' occasional accidents and around the litter box... they work very well for this. I always keep a small supply in the car console to freshen hands after grocery shopping, filling gas tank, light dusting while stopped at traffic light, a refreshing facial wipe on a hot day, etc. etc. My friend thinks they are an excellent to remove small stains on both baby and adult clothes, carpets, upholstery, etc. (I prefer a different product, but use Huggies for this purpose in a pinch.) Since these wipes work very well for such a multitude of uses, I think we save a great deal of money by using them rather than buying all the different individual products.Despite all the above, I only rated these Huggies Wipes 3 stars as they are readily available at a lower price... I keep an eye on the weekly sale flyers in the Sunday newspaper and stock up when they're on sale. I generally pay a good deal less than offered here.One reviewer said he or she finds they dry out or are too dry. I've noticed this happens at times with any brand - it seems to depend how long they have been sitting around. I've learned to: 1) store them upside down, and 2) once package is open, make sure box is always closed tightly when not in use and turn it over every so often in-between uses to undo the effects of gravity.Finally, I totally agree with the reviewer who prefers reach in packages vs. pop-up/tear-off packages since the latter doesn't always work as they should and you're left fumbling around usually with one hand trying to open package fully and tearing off a sheet."
125087,1,"These highchairs are the best! Having six kids we have tried them all, but these, we wish we'd had them for all the kids. We take them everywhere. Visiting, traveling, we take them to every restaurant we go to. They fit perfectly in every booth we've tried. Much better than using those filthy restaurant high chairs. And the tray contains the mess. I highly recommend these!"
166438,1,"We replaced the Pampers sesitive with these and you can tell the difference in both diapers. these a thiner and not as soft. But work just as great and they are cheaper. We have used Pampers since our first kid and after trying different brands this is by far the best; softer, no leaks, good price (amazon subscribe and save)."
120890,1,This gate is awesome. It looks very nice with our modern decor. It was easy for my husband to install. The gate swings either way and is childproof. No complaints. Can be either pressure mounted or screwed in. We are ordering a third gate today.
21239,1,"it looks great, my baby stays asleep in it all night but it goes to slow for him to fall asleep in it. I have to put him in after he falls asleep. But still i love it."
131747,0,I would rate this higher if it the bottles were easier to clean and if the blue inner nipple was more durable. I had to keep replacing the nipple because the inner nipple would get worn pretty quickly. This is a good bottle if you are breastfeeding and bottle feeding.
21466,1,"This item was given to a new mother as a gift and as far as I know, she loves it. The material is extremely soft which is not the case in many of the other cloth diapers I have seen. So we were happy with the softness for the baby's skin."
59166,0,"This warmer is quick and easy but I agree with the other reviewers that the biggest drawback is that is does not have an on/off switch! To turn it off you must unplug it. I found this out the hard way...I thought it was auto shut off and left it on. The water evaporated and the unit was really hot to the touch. I just don't understand why it wouldn't have at least the on/off switch...an auto shut off would be ideal. Still, it was one of the few warmers that would accomodate the Avent bottles. It is a little pricey too considering the design flaw, but overall it is not a bad warmer."
174142,2,"I walked in one day to find my son hanging upside down, and twisted in the straps because the sides aren't high enough. Put it away after 3 months of use and brought it out for our newborn (they don't move much so I wasn't worried about finding him hanging upside down). When I pulled it out the motor no longer worked - I called to complain, and Fisher Price said - tough luck....even though the swing had only been used for 3 months, and the motor was bad....after reading the other's reviews - I felt lucky that mine didn't smoke."
181391,1,"I researched the safest carseats for weeks: Consumer Reports, etc. and I finally bought this one. It's very sturdy, the straps are well made and very secure, fits tightly in the car, and is very comfortable for my son. It reclines so that's great and I wanted to buy one that he sleeps well in and this one does the trick. His head rests on the side of the seat and he doesn't have a problem sleeping and you know how precious sleep can be! So buy it, it's great :)"
120124,1,"We went through a number of bottles with our 1 month old before we all (myself, my wife and our daughter) came to a conclusion that this is the bottle of choice! This could be specific to our baby's taste, but she prefers formula to stay in the bottle unless she wants it out! The only nipple that does not drip on gravity we found was from Playtex VentAire bottles. But the bottles themselves were a pain, we could never get those bottoms to work correctly. So we tried Dr. Browns. These bottles work very smoothly, never a vacuum (BIG problem with Playtex) or a bubble (also happened with Playtex). And the best part... Playtex nipples, the ones with three small cuts, which you have to squeeze to express formula, fit it very well! Of course both Dr Browns and Playtex manuals say to only use their nipples with their bottles, but well... of course they won't tell you to buy competitor product! They just work together, and work very very well!"
134395,1,"We bought this wipe warmer for our newborn baby girl. We wanted to make diaper changing as comfortable for her as possible. WE LOVE IT! She doesn't squirm and cry during changing. It's also great for keeping a small tube of baby lotion nice and warm. She smiles when we massage her body with warm lotion. Although, this may limit the amount of wipes it can hold. My family of all ages loves it too! The only downside to this product is that the lid doesn't lock down tightly. My 1yr old pulls out all the pop-up wipes. She think it's toilet paper. Go figure!!!"
5160,1,I buy these diapers primarily because they are made by a company that doesn't test on animals. The fact that they are chlorine free and more environmentally friendly is an awesome bonus. The price is reasonable especially with amazon's great free shipping. As a diaper they are very good quality and hold just as well as all the leading brands.
64821,2,I had this same baby swing a few years ago. I wanted a new one for my new grandchild. I was excited to find it on line. It was shipped to me without parts. I'm still waiting!!!!! Not Happy
81902,1,"I got this as a shower gift and i must say it's a great pump! I can fill up 5 ounces of milk in 5 minutes! I also have a manual pump and it doesn't even come close.....it's much easyer to pump with this electric one, than it is manualy (it takes forever!) plus this pump is faster and you only need one hand! I enjoy it alot. It has a feature that lets you decide how fast you want it to pump, and it comes in it's own case (take with you anywhere!). Other electric pumps out there are very costly, this one does the job at a great price, it's portable and it also takes batteries (for the road) so it's just the best !"
45112,1,"This is a super product. Baby begins star gazing from early on. It's amazing to watch as baby grows and begins to bat at the objects. I bought the add on animals for $12.99 so there was a lot to look at. As baby got older tummy time was fun due to the different textures and sounds. Also, remove the soft toys and throw them in your baby's bag for quick, on the go, quiet toys."
126769,2,"I have been using huggies for almost 3 yrs for my twin girls, but the latest one it felt different that a normal ...not sure why. they stick together way more than usual and have a rougher texture, and hard....like they are of poorer quality. I hope they will change it, maybe more softness."
182441,1,This is a great deal and much more convenient in a jar to use than a tube where you get the ointment all over your hands.
124924,2,"The spring was too tight so there is no ""jump"" in the Johnny Jump Up. My son just hung there pathetically. He bent his knees and just kind of swung. At 4 months, the basket was way too big for him, he could only get one arm over the bar, and the other was tucked inside because he couldn't reach the other side. He just chewed on the bar, and thats the most entertainment he got out of it. When he did try to jump, if only one of his feet touched the ground, it would spin out of control."
181359,1,"Great product, my son is 10 weeks old and enjoys looking at the various animals ""hanging around"", good music with two volume settings. I like how the animals can come off so he can hold them as well as look at them hanging."
12632,1,"This stroller is so much lighter than what I expected! My 6yr old can maneuver it with ease. The only thing I didn't understand about this is, it's called a Snap N Go, ummm, there is no ""snap"". The car seat just sits on a bar and you have to strap it in in order for it to not fall off. It's still safe and sturdy, AFTER it's strapped in. I like it, but my hubby wasn't as convinced as I am though."
112384,1,"My daughter has the most sensitive skin in the world. We tried every diaper imagineable...from store brand, to expensive brands. The Pampers Cruisers are the only diapers that she not only does not leak through, but fit her great while she is in the process of walking...they are easy on her skin, and she has no diaper rash with them, unlike Huggies, Luvs, and all store brands that we tried. I recommend for any new mom that wants disposeables, to buy these diapers for sure. We are second time parents, and Pampers worked best for both kids with their sensitive skin. Thanks Pampers!!!"
176267,0,"I used disposable diapers with my first two children and will use disposables again. However, on the persistance of my mother, I did purchase some cloth diapers. These were a life saver. These are excellent when the baby has diaper rash, but you can't let them go completely nude. The cloth breaths much better that plastic. If your baby has diaper rash, these are a must!"
183708,1,"I registered for this baby bag backpack because I knew it would be something my husband would not mind carrying around. Comes with changing pad and zippered pouches in which I am able to store 4 - 5 diapers in along with a small bottle of lotion, etc. The insulated bottle compartment is wonderful! In that I am able to carry one 9 oz Avent bottle or two 4 oz Avent bottles along with an ice pack. I feel this backpack is well made. It has been used everday now for 3 + months."
144234,2,We have a standard spout size and this just slides off...nothing is holding it on. I loved the design since it goes with my bathroom theme...but I'd return if it I could.
122525,2,"725 stars is the most misleading marketing ever. The majority of the stars are as big as your tumb nail. And two pages of itty bitty stickers makes up about 125 of the 725. Plus they give you about a 1x1 sqaure of putty to put up the things. Really maybe five dollars worth of product, not worth 15 dollars at all. Very dissapointed. Even the box is misleading. See the plastic circular part of it those are all the stars in the entire thing. Why have a box three times larger than the product?"
160887,1,"After looking at the pictures of this bag I expected a good sized bag that would easily carry a change of clothes for my potty-training toddler as well as all the necessities of carting a newborn around. It's a great quality bag - I love the large zippers and the multiple pockets - but it's not NEARLY as big as it looks in the images. Also, the cell-phone pocket on the shoulder strap is a joke - it's too small to hold any current smartphone, which is what a majority of people have these days. If you're not lucky enough to have one, and still have one of those smaller issues, consider yourself lucky with this bag - your phone will fit conveniently in the pocket! My husband also loves this bag, which is a plus, since, as a stay-at-home dad he'll be using it much more than I will."
80646,0,My 2yr old daughter is obsessed with Dora and loves her pull-ups. I recently ran out and she would not wear her diaper because she wanted her pull up. It has slightly helped in the potty training scene. They aren't as great as a diaper with leaks but I consider this a jump start to potty training and I work around it by putting my daughter in diaper before bed. I love Pampers and must admit I have been trapped into the gimmick of Dora just to please my 2 year old!!P.S. AMAZON Moms Program and subscribe and save ROCK! I not only save tons of money but they come to my door in 2 days. I don't know about other parents but taking my toddler into a Walmart or Target is just not fun so thank you AMAZON.
43257,1,This is the best product for parents with little ones in infant car seats. I had the old version of this with my first son and we lost it in several moves and this one is MUCH better than the old one. The seat is so easy to put in. The basket is large and I love that the handle can be adjusted for height. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an easy alternative to the big bulky strollers. We have a Chicco Key fit and it works wonderfully.
34311,1,"I was a little nervous about buying a stroller online that I had never tested out...but this is a great stroller! It's easy to turn and it's a smooth ride for the kids. My kids loved riding in it. It easily fits into the trunk of my van, and is simple to open and fold up. I just wish there was a little more space underneath for the diaper bag and a parent console...the little water holder bag they give you is pretty worthless. Overall, I would definitely recommend this stroller."
117102,1,"For anyone that is excited to be Dad this is a great way to carry the arsenal that you will need in order to care for your little one. MUCH better than carrying your partners soft, padded, most likely feminine and oversized bag."
158046,1,"This product is the best product I have ever found for a baby. We lost our first child, Jessica, to SIDS at 3 months & 11 days of age in January 2002. Jessica was a rare case and was awake & being held when she went lifeless and died in the babysitters arms instantaniously. Our second child was premie and weighed 3lbs & 14oz when she came home. Due to Jessica, we were able to get an apnea monitor from a medical supply company to use with her. With my 3rd child, he was full-term and the insurance wouldn't pay for the apnea monitor. I researched and researched the different types of over-the-counter monitors we could purchase and finally decided on the Angelcare. I began using it in a basinette the night he came home from the hospital, moved it to a co-sleeper and he is STILL using it EVERY night and naptime and he is 16 months old. We only had 1 false alarm with it and I am still unsure why it went off. At 16 months, he is all over the crib and it never alarms. It is amazing to me how it works, not sure if it picks up on heartrate, breathing or what, but you can watch the light flash with every movement it detects. It is the only way my husband or myself have been able to get any sleep for the past 16 months and I am still not ready to stop using it.Not to terrify any parents, but they say with TRUE SIDS, the baby CAN'T be saved. I knew this with my last 2, but I still had to have a monitor on them. At least I know if something goes wrong, I will be in there immediately and know that I did everything possible to save the baby....not find them 3 or 4 hours later.I would and DO recommend this monitor to anyone I know that is expecting or has a baby. I can't say enough wonderful things about it and just hope they still have them around whenever I have grandkids! The best thing any expectant or new parent can do is purchase one of these....it will give you the peace of mind that your baby is alive and breathing!"
115942,1,I ordered these as a doubler and read the reviews after so I am now using them as a liner (which I now realize is their intention) in my pocket diapers to save from some stains. With them being so inexpensive I think they will do the job and I can always order more if they fall apart. Better than disposable liners.
62431,1,I have two and my baby loves them. One is kind of a teether with no pictures in it. She loves biting on the pages and the handle. The other one has pictures of family and we point and tell them who they are. It is great and I was worried about the pictures getting soggy but they don't. Really neat little album for babies.
12494,0,"I really want to give this product 2.5 stars, the average of 1.5 stars for quality and 4 stars for design/looks. I purchased this lamp for my 3 year old son's room. It's very attractive and he loves it, but within about 6 weeks after purchase with very limited use - just at bedtime for about 30 minutes - the inner ring that attaches the lampshade to the metal rigging that goes over the light bulb and holds the shade in place tore spontaneously so that the lampshade detached from it and fell. Nobody touches the lamp, it's sitting on top of a dresser, so it must have happened as a result of the heat produced by the bulb melting or somehow damaging the tape that attached the shade to the rigging. We made sure we were using the right type of light bulb, so too much heat was not the issue. I'm disappointed, I want to like this lamp, but the quality does not match the price. I will now need to look for a solution to repair the shade or buy a new one to use the lamp again."
33803,1,"We've been using this table for about 2 months, and it is awesome. The shape is neat but also functional. Since there are no cabinets, everything is open and easily available, which is a necessary convenience for this kind of furniture.Yes, it's expensive, but baby stuff usually is. At least this doesn't look like crap, too. If you haven't realized this yet, I'll let you in on a dirty little secret: no matter how fashion-forward your design sense has been until now, your home is going to be filled with lots of aesthetically displeasing furniture--have you seen some of the cribs out there? The Stokke Care is not only useful, it's also good-looking, which is a rarity in the baby stuff world. Just because you're becoming a parent doesn't mean you can't have cool-looking stuff anymore. So splurge.Have I said how convenient it is? Only a few times? Trust me, when you're trying to clean a squirming infant who's suddenly shot out a fresh stream of poop/pee, you'll appreciate not having to pull open a cabinet to get to fresh wipes, a new diaper, or a change of clothes.I definitely recommend getting the Huggies disposable changing pads (they sell them near checkout at Babys r Us) and laying them on top of the pad. Accidents WILL happen, and having to pop the cushion into the laundry won't help your mood any."
122743,2,"This is the worst chair to buy for your baby. I bought this chair when my daughter was 4 months old (she is 16 months today) and I have been using it the entire time since she started solids. The only nice thing about it is the style is funky and people ask me about it all the time. I bought it because I thought it would be useful as a table and chair as well as a highchair. She is about 32 inches tall and still too short to use it as a table and chair. Assembly was easy and quick with plastic ""screws"" that you can use a quarter to tighten it up. I have found that the screws loosen all the time and have had to tighten them up at least six times since I have bought it. Secondly, there are two slots in the back for the safety straps, but only one opening in the seat cover, so the upper slot is pretty much useless since the cover openings are only positioned for the lower slots. Also, threading it through the slots and the cover was really difficult. The seat cover is not machine washable, but can be wiped clean. After a year of using it, I noticed that the plastic layer on the cover was separating by the leg area and has since ripped off (like plastic wrap). The absolute worse part about this chair is the huge space between the tray and the back of the seat, both in the innermost/upright position, there is about 11 inches of space there. Unless you have a super chubby huge baby, most of the food will end up in the baby's lap. I use a Bibbity, and the food still falls past it and into her lap. Also, there is a safety ""stump"" looking thing attached to the seat that prevents your baby from slipping underneath the tray. The strap that goes between the legs comes through an opening right in front of this ""stump"". So, you can imagine the kind of food bits that end up around the strap and inside the seat bottom. This part is not easy to clean, and if something liquidy goes in there, you'll have to take it apart with a screwdriver. My baby had a lot of trouble with her gag reflex and would often throw up in the chair. Many times (at least 50 times that I remember), some of the throw up would go in that space, and under the ""stump"" and I would have to take it apart to clean it. It was a pain, but then I got smarter and had a plastic bowl handy during mealtimes to try to catch it before it went into her lap. Of course, anyone who has a baby with this problem, knows that it isn't easy to anticipate or catch it in time. There are also two colored ""buttons"" on the tray which seem to have no purpose other than to collect bits of food under it. The safety clip is very snug and I have pinched my fingers and my daughter's tummy in it many times while securing it. I always got a bruise that would last a few days, it is that sore! This chair would be great if the seat cover was more durable and had openings for the upper slots, and if the tray could slide in closer to your baby. I wish I had bought the Fisher Price Healthy Care highchair instead. It is a bulky chair that takes up a lot of room. It is hardly portable in its assembled state, although I do admit to taking the ""chair"" part with the tray to visit relatives since it fits in the back of my SUV.I now use the Fisher Price Healthly Care booster chair during visits instead. I also have a Combi stroller and have used the Connection infant carrier which I loved, so I was very disappointed that Combi put out such a poorly designed highchair.Update (April 2010)I have kept this highchair with hopes that I might get some use out of it. Since having another baby, I took it out to check it. The colored lift out tray and the two colored ""nubs"" somehow got tacky with age, you know how some plastic gets that way? So I have tossed out the colored tray, and used pliers to wrench out the colored nubs. There are now two holes but at least they are not sticky and whatever food goes in there, I can wipe off, and it ends up on the arm part when you slide the tray off completely. As for the huge gap, I bought a foam seat insert and put it in a 2 gallon ziploc bag to keep it clean, and I use it as a backrest, which puts baby right up to the front. Though it looks ugly, at least the highchair is still functional as a highchair. I had to cut out parts for the straps and have those loosened all the way in order to buckle in baby."
41913,0,"I received this at my baby shower. It was hand-me-down, so who knows how many kids it's seen, and it's still clean, soft, and cute -- definitely wins points for quality, durability, and ease of laundering.But my son couldn't care less about it. In the twelve months since he was born, he's never once so much as nibbled on it or fiddled with its sewn-on eyes or tail or ears or ANYTHING. And he's a hard-core nibbler/fiddler. It gets more use as an emergency blanket when he's conked out on top of us and nothing else is in reach.I can totally see this becoming a baby's favourite lovey, and it's so well-made, it would probably outlast the lovey stage. But if you've got one of those high-energy, inquisitive, fiddly babies, it may not be a good investment. This is just not interesting enough for my son, even when he's falling asleep!"
140049,1,"This gate is a Craftsman design, high quality gate that works well with large openings. It is easy to put together and sufficiently tall for a small (under 10 pounds) dog. If there is a drawback -- it takes tools to change the width of the gate. But I love it!"
147346,2,"Don't bother buying this product. Any other product in your home that runs on 2.4 ghz will interfere with the reception. I even turned my wireless network off, and still received horrible reception and sound."
122777,1,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! My daughter has to take a medication daily and this does the trick!! The paci part is very soft and flexible like a regular pacifier. The medicine holder part is great seals nicely and the plunger is great to get the medicine flowing! Easy to clean. So much easier than a syringe or medicine dropper!! I bought two!
148754,1,"This is seriously the best maternity pillow out there. I bought this pillow when I started having trouble sleeping and a regular pillow wasn't providing the support I needed. I did a ton of research and this one had the best reviews. I completely agree it is well worth the money for a good night sleep. It provides support in both the front and back of you. You don't have to move the pillow from side to side when you change sleeping positions (really great selling point) It is big, but well worth a good night sleep. My husband still has plenty of room on his side of the bed."
48392,1,"I am SO glad we bought this monitor. It works GREAT for us. No interference, picture is very clear, and I love the portability. Easy to install the camera. We are very happy with this product!"
40823,1,I have tried other diapers and always kick myself for wasting money on anything other than the pampers cruisers. These diapers have fit both of my children better than any other diaper I have tried.
136242,1,"I highly recommend this exersaucer. My daughter is 6 months old and she loved it the minute we put her inside. We bought this model because it looked like it would provide many stimulating activities for the baby to do; much more than the other brands and models. I was a bit hesitant to buy it at first because it is a little pricey, but I have learned the hard way not to cheap-out and this toy is definitely worth a little extra money (priced at $99, it only costs $20-40 more than other models that are not nearly as nice). I was very pleased that all of the tray toys are of high quality. The thick cloth seat seems comfortable for my daughter, and it is removeable for laundering. The toys are removable and can be moved around to different places on the tray to give baby a change of scenery. There are butterflies on the leg tops that spin when my daughter shifts her weight...she loves to grab at them. This toy has been a hit with her, and we have not even installed batteries yet to use the musical/educational activities!!!I have not looked around, but I am hoping that there are interchangeable parts available for this toy so that I can change the activities every week or so. So if you are a designer for this toy, PLEASE listen and make more tray toys! They will definitely sell!My daughter will be using this play station for a long time...there are several height adjustments and she is using the lowest setting at 6 months (she's 25-26 inches tall).I have not tried to collapse this toy yet, but apparently you can fold it up for storage or travel."
7744,1,"I absolutely love this fragrance. Although I have others I really enjoy, such as Ferrari Black and Polo Black, my girlfriend describes this one as ""the one that 'The Most Interesting Man in the World' would wear"" (we both love those commercials). It's robust without being overwhelming, inherently masculine (i dare say it makes my girl a little giddy when i wear it), lasts all day and then some, and is really just a great value. This fragrance could be worn with an expensive suit or business-casual attire, and is sure to be a hit either way."
66802,1,"The pocket in the middle is very small. It seems bigger in the picture. The cup holders are slim and will only fit slim bottles, however, this is a jogging stroller so it would make sense that the holders will only fit slim/water bottles. On the console it clearly states not to put hot beverages in the holders. This product is made out of fabric so it will spill easily. The straps that secure the product to the BOB is Velcro but it seems to be pretty strong."
181137,1,My son LOVES this. It is by far the best playmat/gym ever. Its a little pricey but def. worth the money. Easy assembly. The mat is very padded. Lots of neat little toys. But my fav thing about this is the mobile and the lights. Keeps my son busy for at least 15 minutes.
39538,1,I cannot say enough positive things about this item! I absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night. This item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids.
121734,0,The Boppy would have 5 stars if the filling didn't flatten so quickly. My baby is four months and I'm already having to put a pillow under the Boppy for better support during nursing. (Sigh)
78041,2,"We were so excited for this high chair to arrive - we desperately needed one that folded, and we knew this model was relatively light. Both of those things were true - it does fold quite flat, and it's very light, which makes it easy to move about and carry from room to room. I also appreciate how light the tray itself is, which makes it easy to hold with one hand when I have to pop it off while I'm holding my son.However, we've found that it's not the ideal chair for our very curious 18 month-old.Our son figured out how to remove the tray cover within seconds of first sitting in the chair, rendering the cover completely useless.He has now, after about a month in the chair, figured out how to use his foot to push in the release handle so the full tray pops off. He also figured out how to pop the side handles off.Because the bar in between the legs is fixed in place and attached to the snack tray, it can be difficult to get him in and/or out when he's squirmy.It's unlikely that a day goes by when either my husband or I don't say something along the lines of ""I really hate this chair"".... usually when we're picking our son's lunch up off the floor because he flipped the tray again.I think this would be a fantastic high chair for child that isn't quite as exploratory/active - my son beats up on everything - but if you have a child that likes to ""tinker"", you may run into some of the same problems we have."
91279,0,"My mother purchased this monitor for me. I receive no static when the monitor is operation on batteries, however battery life runs really short if left on for long periods of time. When I utilize the plug for this monitor all I get is static and it is really difficult to sleep at night with nothing but static and who wants to purchase batteries all the time? Not me."
41394,1,I really got a great deal on the diapers and was excited that they were free shipping also.
86057,1,"This item works fine for me. The picture quality is great during the day and night. I live in a well populated neighborhood and have not had any trouble, but there is really no children in my neighborhood where anyone else would use a monitor."
153379,1,"We purchased the Peg Perego Pliko P3 for our daughter before she was born and after 16 months are very satisfied with the stroller. Both my husband and I are avid internet shoppers and routinely perform an inordinate amount of research before we purchase. After researching the various strollers we opted for this stroller because it could be used with the Peg Perego Infant seat as a travel system. Ultimately, we made this purchase because of the coordinating infant seat (which also had good reviews), user reviews, style and overall weight.My husband had a little difficulty figuring out how to operate the set up and fold up, but when he admitted that he needed to read the instructions he was able to operate it like a pro. I can operate it with one hand, but agree that two hands are the preferred method. I rarely use the basket below as it is inconvenient and difficult to use. I draped my messenger style diaper bags over the two handles or hang the tote style from the handles for quick easy access. I only use the bottom for storage of things I don't think I will need, but take anyway. The cup holder is adequate for a normal size beverage but will not accommodate a Big Gulp or water jug so I plan accordingly.I am extremely happy with the maneuverability, construction, quality and function of the stroller. I use it 3 or four times a week for shopping trips to the mall or family excursions. I have removed and machine washed the seating and found that it was easy enough to remove and reinstall. I recently thought I would purchase a light weight Maclaren stroller, but have just concluded that the one I wanted was only 3 pounds lighter than this one and couldn't justify the expense of a new stroller for 3 pounds. This exercise forced me to think about something I use and have concluded that I would make the same purchase today that I made 1 years ago and I don't have too many things that I can say that about."
152585,1,This product works great. You hook it to your medella bra with rubber bands and pump with hands free to do other things. I am so glad a coworker told me about this product!
142142,2,"I am on my third child, and last hopefully as lovely as they are, and have always had a Baby Bjorn. I give it a two because it does it's basic job, to carry. Although functional, my back along with my husband's and anyone I know who has ever owned one, is always suffering after a couple hours out and about. I thought that was normal as our babies are a new added weight to our bodies, but this time time around I bought the Ergo, which wasn't around when i had my first two. NIGHT and DAY. While the Baby Bjorn rests all the weight upon your shoulders, the Ergo redistributes the weight to your hips while requiring less support from the shoulders. To be clear, I own the Baby Bjorn with the lumber support.I'm sorry to sound like an advertisement, but after using the Bjorn for soooo long, which by the way doesn't last long because you feel like it begins to squeeze your little one after a few months, I had to get the word out there.If you are considering buying the Baby Bjorn, please do yourself a favor and research with friends etc. both the Ergo vs. the Bjorn. I also have a sling, and that's pretty awesome too, but not as much versitility in the way you can carry your baby as the Ergo. And as one dad told me on the subway when i was doing my own research on the two, The Ergo lasts as long as you last carrying them. His child was 2 1/2 at the time. Better long term investment. Good luck to all and your backs."
40087,0,"We bought this sound machine for our baby's room. This is our 4th sound machine in the last 10 years, and we were disappointed with this one because it is so quiet. You would have to place it close to your head to drown out other noises. There is a great selection of sounds and features, so if your house is a quiet one, this may work for you."
6486,2,"The product from Pampers is great. We bought this online to avoidhassles to rush into local stores.However, the shipping is really disappointing. First, I don't think theyeven bother to ring the bell at our gate before leaving a notice. After their secondnotice on Fri., we called them asking about the package and they told uswe could pick up (~10 miles away). On Sat. we called themagain that we wanted them to deliver on Mon instead of picking up ourselves.But nothing happened until Mon. afternoon, we called again and they couldnot locate our request to deliver: there was nothing on their record.Bored of this process we drove there and picked up ourselves.REALLY disappointing. This carrier is not so good as carriers used by amazon before."
11798,1,"This is the best product on the market to give infants the ability to aquire tastes for solid foods and give them the ability to ease the pain of teething. My 5 month old daughter was having a terrible time with chewing on everything from her hands to her toes. Now I give her a banana, carrot, or other solid food in her feeder and she will spend a long time satisfying her taste buds and easing her gums. The best thing is to chill anything that you put in the feeder. That helps their tiny gums. A MUST for any mother (or father) with a teething infant at home!!!"
135044,0,"I guess I expected a plush towel when ""super soft"" was in the title of the product. It's not. Just a regular old towel. Which is fine with me ultimately. At least they're not scratchy and unabsorbent like the hooded towels i got from target."
147711,1,"We just had our first baby so we purchased the Peg Perego Skate Stroller and Car Seat with SIP. We love it! We weren't sure about it at first because of the higher price, but glad we spent the extra money!!!"
170193,1,"I am only giving this 4 stars because I haven't actually used the crib yet.The reason for my hasty review is to comment that the color for the GREY crib is much different than it appears here. Whereas the color appears very light on the pictures, it is actually a true grey (like an elephant or mouse?). I was VERY happy with this because I really wanted a darker color but settled for the Emily because of the reasonable price.It was shipped quickly and arrived nicely packaged. I wil try to update my review once I use it!"
71483,1,"Recently we drove down to Milan and spent the entire day site-seeing. I wore our 20 pound toddler on my back most of the day. The way the carrier positions the weight on your hips instead of your back is really amazing. It is almost as if you cannot feel that you are carrying anything at all. My only complaints though is that by the end of the day the muscles in my hips were pretty tired even though I walk somewhere around 6 or 7 miles everyday. Another minor issue was that after a while, the belt around my hips started to dig my jeans and belt into my hip bone. It left a sore spot the next day, but nothing that I can't get over being that this was the most amazing carrier we have ever used."
140212,2,"I purchased this stroller for my 4 month old and my 24 month old. I am not a jogger so I thought it would be good for me when I was walking. I do have a great single one and I didn't want to spend the money on the double, I really regret it now.Pros: There is an adjustable sun shade. The seats can recline individually. The price.Cons: The stroller does not turn easily. The seats are tilted back, so even if they are sitting up they are still somewhat reclined. It is a workout in itself to push them for a daily walk,(that might be a pro.) It doesn't push straight, it pulls to one side. This is the second one that is like this, I returned the first one because it was pulling to one side. The customer service is awful, when I called them with a problem their advice was to take it to a bike shop, no returns or exchanges."
58963,1,When using the Avent Steam Sterilizer You have to use distilled water so you won't get that black build up of carbon from your tap water. It clearly tells you on the instructions to use distilled water. Also even if you use filtered water it still has carbon in it so it will cause that black build up. Also after using the sterlizer open it up so it can air out you cannot expect something that steams and produces water in a closed space not to build up something if you do not clean it or open it to air out. This is a great product and I am very pleased with it!
151095,2,"I bought a nojo while I was pregnant because I wanted to be able to breastfeed in it and use it rightaway after our baby was born. I tried when he was 2 days old and I had so many problems with it, because it was just too big and had too much padding in the way. I'm pretty average size--5'4"", 150 lbs. Also the video was not helpful. I got a baby bjorn instead (which doesn't allow breastfeeding) and my baby hated being upright, plus it made him spit up alot in that position. So, I went back to the sling idea and read some reviews here and ordered from babymoon slings. Definitely a better fit since the padding is so small I can get it really tight around baby and me. Now that I've figured out how to use a sling and my baby is 3 months I've tried the Nojo again, it's just not comfortable or attractive--I don't get why its so popular or why dr. sears doesn't make it better, it seems it really wouldn't be that hard to improve upon."
151685,1,"I love this oil! It smells great, goes on smoothly and easily and is a nice light oil. The scent is not strong or unpleasant at all, and I'm very sensitive to artificially strong smells when pregnant. It's a great excuse to give yourself a little &#34;mama time&#34; in the bathroom every morning and evening, when you can massage some oil on your big beautiful belly :) I put it on my hips too. As far as it preventing stretch marks, most of that is genetic, but it certainly doesn't hurt to keep your skin hydrated! I could see using this as a massage oil in labor also.The price is worth it to me, and I can see my little bottle lasting a long time because it doesn't take very much for one use--just a few drops really. And it doesn't &#34;spray&#34; out; it just squirts out a couple drops when you pump it. I'd much rather buy a grapeseed and essential oil-based stretch oil than all of those others that are based on petroleum products. Your skin is just a big sponge and absorbs whatever you put on it! I love the Earth Mama line because you know you're getting a high quality, organically sourced product."
167374,1,"We already had a Britax car seat for my 3 year old daughter. I was hoping to move her up into a booster seat, but she was not ready to give up her car seat for her younger brother yet. That's how I decided to get a new car seat for my 10 month old son. And since I had good experience with my first one, I just stayed with the same brand and type.Both my children are tall and this car seat seems to accomodate that."
47852,2,"I had high hopes for this gate. We bought it to keep our son from reaching through the bars to tease our cat, but since our doorway has baseboards, he simply reached under it. While I appreciate the unique design, we found it wobbly and difficult to install tightly in the doorway when used as a pressure gate. Oh, and our son also figured out how to raise the latch the first day (he's 20 months). I'm returning it today."
122617,1,"We LOVE this stroller. It is light and easy use, folds up and travels well and can easily be unfolded with one hand. If you are a mall shopper, there in not a lot of storage, however we bought some little clips at a local baby supply store and use to hang shopping bags and purses. I would highly recommend to the active family who wants a stroller that is functional and easy to use."
123280,1,I love this play yard! Its huge and colorful. The best thing is that I'm able to fold it up and take it with me when I'm traveling. My son is so comfortable in it and I feel it was worth every penny. I expected it to be hard to assemble but was suprised at how easy it is to put it together. Great buy!
19121,1,"I am about to be a first-time Nana!! Unfortunately, almost 3 years ago I lost my left arm. I have alot of concerns about how I will comfortably hold and adjust my grandchild, and I'm sure my daughter & son in law will have reservations. Do current users think this would be secure & helpful for me? I really want to be able to cuddle the baby safely without the arm fatigue I will surely experience if I don't use something to assist me. Feedback will be appreciated. Thanks!"
112719,2,"I have used Pampers on my baby since she was a newborn. I don't know why Pampers changed the cruisers. It used to be soft, have a great cover lining and be very absorbent.Now they are very papery, they took out the lining and it takes minutes for the diaper to absorb the pee. Also, the absorbent material goes only half way up the diaper.So disappointed! Just bought a 180 ct box..."
168138,1,"Pampers Swaddlers are the best! Last week, I thought I would save some money by purchasing the Luv's brand. Ew. They're hard plastic-y diapers. The Swaddlers are nice and comfy and hold lots of tinkle and other baby by-products. We're definitely switching back to Swaddlers."
25368,1,"After trying about everything out there, we found that these are the best we've tried. Also the most expensive. The magnet latch is great, becuse even tiny fingers can't get between the door and latch.Tip - They come with adhesive pads and screws. The adhesive is very strong, but as we've found doesn't last forever. Use the adhesive for positioning, test them a few times for alignment, and then screw them in. (Won't be screwed in to a visible spot in your cabinets.)"
161536,2,"We originally liked this tub. The idea is great, but once you begin using it you realize the problems right away. On a flat surface, our kitchen counter, the tub leaked a little. Once you went to move it to drain it, it leaked everywhere. It never seems like it locks the way the pictures on the box show, but there is no other way to lock it open. Also, the rubber pad on the bottom and the cloth &quot;sling&quot; smell very quickly. You have to wash the sling portion every day or so. We only used this for about a month and then went and bought the Primo Euro tub. We just got that so I can't really comment on it yet. I don't recommend the 4 in 1 bath station in it's current form. Needs to be reworked."
159414,1,This is the best thing I have used so far! I use it all of the time. It is great to take in the bathroom when you want to take a shower. I love the mode that turns off by itself and then restarts if your little one moves. I love love it! It sure makes life a lot easier. I have a lot of stuff that was really a waste but this is worth every penny!!!
46523,1,"This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring. My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a ""bunkie"" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it. I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a ""big boy"" bed that doesn't have a box spring (although the manufacturer recommends it)."
160832,1,I had a bulky diaper bag and it wouldn't go over my shoulder and was such a pain to take around along with my purse and the baby. I use this as my purse and diaper bag and it has tons of room. This helps make life much simpler now that I can put this over my shoulder and ditch the dumb purse! Yay!*Updated* 5/28/12 - I am still using this bag and it has not shown one bit of wear...it still looks brand new! I really love how it clips onto the stroller so it can't be lost or stolen and it is easy to carry the bag and handle a energetic toddler at the same time.
12864,0,"I am 5 1/2 months pregnant w/ our first. We have not yet been able to hear the baby's heartbeat NOT for lack of trying, and I don't expect this to work; that was a bummer. My Dr. also confirmed that these things don't work. A pregnant co-worker of mine had success, but she is SUPER skinny! However, we can hear her move and kick, so that is kind of fun. I did like the microphone that it came with (although you have to use your own stereo) and I did like the little speakers to play classical music for the baby (although again you have to use your own tape or CD player). Overall I would not recommend this product, just use a walkman to play music for the baby."
152429,1,"I used them for a while then switched to pampers and were terrible at least for my daugter(read my review about them), we got back on ""huggies track"".I wish they had flaps in the front because they get a little tight when baby is about to move to the next size, and by that I also mean that sizes are a little smaller than what's indicated in package."
54288,1,"Do you want a choice of 3 classical tunes to hear over and over, or Zip-a-dee-doo-dah? That was why I chose this one - the three classical choices, and I'm very happy I did. He loved it when he was first born, and he still loves it at five months. When he gets bored lying under it, I can sit him up and start it again. I also wish the sound and motion were able to run separately, but I still like it. We've only changed the batteries once, and the colors are nice and bright, with rotating black and white patterns visible from the underside. It also spins easily to the side, so for bedtime I can move the stimulation away."
84322,1,"This is the best swing out there. Best features:-ability to adjust back as baby grows and wants to sit more upright. Many other swings sit back way too far and my baby didnt like that at all!-ability to remove the tray makes for ease in taking baby out-VERY SAFE...3 point harness, in addition to the tray that comes down.-length of ropes is perfect...not to high or too low!Overall, I dont think you will find a better swing with all these features."
180110,1,"This is on my list of must haves for new moms. When you are engorged anytime throughout the day, but particularly at night, this pump is a life saver! It is easy to use and you get a lot out during a short time. It's portability is also nice and convenient compared with the freestyle or other electronic pumps. This will be my new baby shower gift for all my girlfriends because it is so useful!My only recommendation is that when you are new to breastfeeding and pumping, use lanolin before you pump. This will help with any chaffing that may occur while you're pumping. I HIGHLY recommend the Medela Lanolin over the Lansinoh when you're pumping and just in general. The Lansinoh however, is far better to use before you get in the shower because it is thicker and provides a greater barrier between your sore nipples and the sprays of water."
149776,1,"I read the reviews about this product prior to purchasing it and although the common thread about it being too soft was evident, I bought two anyway. I'm not disappointed with the trays so far. My oldest son is 3, and he used the tray on a 3 hour drive. He had a blast crashing his cars on the table top and I'm glad I had an area to place his snacks so that fries and nuggets weren't smashed between the car seat cushions. My youngest son is 1 1/2 and he had an issue with the tray sitting on his legs the very first time he used it, on a 20 minute ride home from day-care. After that first time he was ok with it. I definitely recomend it from a practical stand point but as a mom I know some kids just won't like using it, personal preferences and all. I gave it a four because although it has the lips, on occasion things do roll off somehow...maybe its my kids, and because the pockets are in weird places so the kids can't reach some of the things in them espcially small things like crayons."
84432,1,This is a great swing for the young kids. It is easy to hang and the toddler is very secure in it. It is extremely sturdy and well designed. My grandson really enjoys swinging in it.
139897,1,"I purchased the tot wheels activity center about 1 1/2 weeks ago for my 5 month daughter. she does enjoy playing in it, however the horn has quit working and also the little people buttons only word occasionally. I was also disappointed in the brake system, we purchased this product specifically because it could be stationary for now and mobile when needed, however the product is still able to move with the brakes on. Everything else works fine and she really enjoys chewing on the sun and shifting the gears. Just thought I would comment on this product. Thanks."
124869,1,"I have this bag and it is really nice. It fits all my kids stuff, I like how it is nice and boxy. It looks like the Petunia Pickle bottom but I did not pay that high of a price. My friend told me about how nice are Global Kecci bags and I am glad that I listened to her advice and bought the bag. This is a nice bag that I would recommend to others."
173336,1,This swing is great! It provides gentle movement as my granddaughter sleeps. When she's awake she loves watching the moving mobile and listening to the music. She has disccovered the baby smiling back at her in the mirror. The swing also provides the incline the Dr. said my granddaughter needs for her little tummy problems.
147321,0,The box gives no warning but the first day I opened it up and used the monitor it worked perfectly until I used the microwave in the kitchen. The monitor went crazy made awful noises and stopped working completely. The next day I got it working again but it is not working that good and I think I should just plan on returning it before it is too late and I'm stuck. Other than that the picture and sound quality seemed good.
131020,1,"I just loved this stroller. It is light weight, I can fold it easily and throw it in the back of my wagon!We have horses, so I chose this as an off roader, and it lived upto every bit of it! It will go anywhere! The seats are very spacious and recline very easily. You can have a new born in one side and a toddler in the other and it accommodates really well.I used this until my son was 50lb and my daughter 30lb! You really no not notice the weight unless you are going uphill! (They have to ride bikes now!)I highly recommend this, it is durable, rugged and stands upto the beating the kids will give it! Five stars!I also had the single version of it before I got the double, also an outstanding product."
22413,1,"Just had my first grandchild in September. This was recommended over any other product by anyone I asked. It sets up easily, breaks down just as easily and quickly. Its versatility is very clever. It's been nearly 30 years since we've had a baby in the house and I'm amazed at the wonderful products available today!"
15068,1,"Yes, you could go to the hardware store and pick up the same items, but honestly, the convenience is clutch in my life these days as I am installing this for a very mobile 10 month old --I used the zip ties on the bannister and actually covered the contact portions on the bannister (square bannister) with felt tape so that it doesn't hurt the wood. I actually bought two of these kits, and had to use two zip ties at the top and two at the bottom. I cut the extra wood from the 2nd one into spacers to keep the long piece of wood plumb and true vertically. I actually drilled cross holes into the top and bottom of the long piece of wood and then fished the large zip ties through this to create even more stability and leave the surface of the wood smooth. Then I used a small screw (predrilled EVERYTHING.. this is strong wood) that screwed right into the front of the wood into the zip tie that traversed the piece of wood to keep it from sliding side to side - hopefully that all makes sense.on the other side, I bought the official bannister kit and used it as a clamp on wrought iron ballusters. and then a piece of wood to attach to both of these.I thought this was a good product, but you do need to have some imagination and some engineering prowess to get the final result that you desire.Best of luck."
25350,0,"So it is actually a real clever device. When it works, it is really elegant and concealed. We picked this product because it was the only child safety lock which you wouldn't have to screw into a cabinet (we rent). We have 3 cabinet doors that we have tried it on. One of the doors works great and if all the doors worked as well, we would be 100% satisfied. However, on one of the doors, we've tried a couple of times and it keeps coming off the cabinet wood. On the third door, we aren't sure what we did wrong, but it doesn't click shut. If you are able to screw the product into your cabinets, I am still sure it works beautifully. However, if you are hoping that the adhesive is strong enough to stick to your cabinet doors, I'd keep looking."
163252,1,"I can't stand lugging around a huge bag and refused to buy a diaper bag - I found this works just as well. It has a detachable changing pad and fits 3-6 diapers plus lotions and a spare outfit. I breastfed so I didn't need any room for bottles, etc. You can pop this into any other tote and it works great. I store it in the front of my Maclaren stroller and it's the perfect size and weight - I have no issues with tipping the stroller over with a huge & heavy bag."
75181,1,We have been using these Gentle care diapers ever since my son is born and he is 2 months now. There have been no rashes or signs of fussiness due to diaper. I give full 5 stars to this product.
175677,2,"This product should be recalled. It's sold based on the premise of reducing SIDS by using it as a blanket.My husband and I were horrified to check on our child in the middle of the night (our movement monitor even beeped to say he had stopped breathing) and see all this material bunched up around his face!!! I was angry, and felt guilty for trusting the claims of this product. (I just saw that two other reviewers said the same thing on other colored versions of this same product).I loved the idea of this combo sleepsack/swaddle. However, it is easy for a child to work his/her fingers out at the bottom of the swaddle arms - at least it is for our child. If your child can break out of other swaddles (which most of my friends kids can) then DO NOT USE THE SWADDLE PART OF THIS BLANKET!How does is get messed up? I put our child in the sleepsack/swaddle a second time so I could watch (supervised) how the material ended up bunched up. Even with a tight swaddle, and the swaddle arms velcro'd as low as they will go on the back of the sleepsack... if the child bends their legs up at all, their fingers can start to feel the bottom of the swaddle arms. Then, the baby can work their fingers and arms out from the bottom. The result is that the swaddle part bunches up around their neck and face (even with the little tab in the back secured).RECOMMENDATIONS:Halo should add velcro and/or snaps on the front of the swaddle arms to attach it to the sleepsack to keep it in place.Use the ""Swaddle Me"" blankets instead for a safer swaddle option. There is less material, and the baby's legs actually pull down on the swaddle, so it keeps any loose material away from baby's face if the baby manages to break out. (With this HALO sleepsack/swaddle, the baby's legs don't help pull down on the swaddle arms)."
52590,2,"I have the whole ocean wonders set!!! and I love it! but this swing is just horrible!! my daughter is now 4 months and still doesnt get in it. It sits to high. I wonder what they were thinking when they mad it??? the others lay back, I DO NOT reccomend this swing for anything"
97650,1,"We were using a potty insert for the big potty but my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter didn't want anything to do with it so we thought if she had her own potty we would have better luck.I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before making a decision to purchase this item. I'm very happy and pleased with my decision.This potty is great. It comes apart easily for cleaning. It is just the right height for her to get on and off without help. The hole for the potty is large enough so everything goes where it's suppose to and the seat is soft and flexible and shaped for comfort, and I mean soft plastic not padded so nothing soaks into it to cause odors later. We drop the lid and use it as a stool for washing hands after.She immeidately started using this potty and the entire family is pleased. I highly recommend this potty."
143539,1,This seems a little watery in texture and the smell is okay. I prefer dr. bronners baby castile soap over this one.

52564,1,"We have been using this swing almost 2 weeks with our newborn. However, we added a Snuzzler to the seat for more support because it is made for older babies. Our baby loves the swinging motion. I love the portability of the swing. I have been taking it from the family room to the bath room which allows me valuable shower time without worrying. We originally were thinking about purchasing the larger swing, but I am glad that we decided on this swing because of the portability and size. I highly recommend this swing."
148806,1,"I couldn't have done without this item during my pregnancy. I began using it around month four and never removed it from my bed until I came home from the hospital with the baby. It's a little difficult to stuff the pillow back into the cover. Towards the end of my pregnancy I needed help putting it back together.As someone who is picky about my sheets, I found the pillow cover to be lacking. After just two washes, the fabric began to develop uncomfortable pilling. Also, even though I took care to fluff the pillow stuffing regularly, there were definite signs of wear and irreversible compression around month seven (about three months of use)."
69076,1,"I like them very much, soft, and my kid likes it too. Due to these items as consume goods, if I can have some coupons to have cheaper price (cost) on it, it will very helpful for me to purchase them again. Chung Wu"
76210,1,"I've only been using these a few weeks but they've definitely been put to the test. I've made a ton of baby food already and used these trays to freeze them and then pop the cubes into pyrex containers in my freezer.Pros:-dishwasher safe (put them in before first use and every time since)-stackable (easily) and compact (take up very little room in my freezer)-clean (i.e., no contamination because covers are tight)-BPA freeCons:-a little hard to load (this is probably with any ice tray; haven't devised a great system for transferring a large batch into these trays while still keeping each cube individual)-stains (I put carrots in and the white trays are a little orange; I couldn't care less but some people might)-a little hard to get cubes out; I think this would be a bigger problem if I was to try to get one cube out at a time for use but I'm transferring all cubes simultaneously to another container. Even so, because the tray is not flexible, it takes a little muscle to twist it enough to loosen everything but then once you do, all the cubes come out easilyOverall, I'm ordering more today if that tells you how much I like them. Incidentally, I can't speak for breastmilk because that's not why I got them."
66776,1,"This is a very functional, useful and very necessary addition to a double BOB stroller. The cup holders fit most standard size cups. I do have a few large Nalgene bottles that are too big, but they don't fit in any holders. The zipper pocket in the middle is perfect to hold keys and phone, and usually something extra like a small pack of kleenex or granola bar. I just wish these things would be designed with the stroller, but that is a complaint against the stroller, not against this product."
51954,1,"This did take some getting use to, for both me & the baby. I recommend starting off slow (1st time for about 15 min. and gradually increase) until you and the baby become comfortable. Its a great tool and big help in not having to constantly ""hold"" your baby on your own. We love it."
113883,1,"This is an excellent product. I was using a high chair for my first baby. Then I got this in e-mail from amazon.com as a recommendation. Looking at the price and reviews I thought to give it a try (I was already fed up with my high chair as cleaning was very tough). Believe me this is so good. The curve in the back rest, the bump on the seat, the 3-position tray setting, the 3-position height adjustment, dishwasher safe tray and lid.....the list of goods go on.....this review I am giving is when I bought a second one for my second baby. First I bought a maroon and tan one now it's green and blue. Both are really awesome. One thing I found was the straps on the blue-green one are longer than on maroon-tan one which makes it easy with big kids. I don't know if it's like that with the models or the new version comes like that. Perfect for easy cleaning and carrying. I have been using these on daily basis for 3 years now. Hope this helps."
184505,2,"So...I bought this for our 7 month old. What a nightmare. What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE. It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen. And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end. Forget the bar cover. It is just as narrow. This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING. To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support. My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed. The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.Just bad. Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart!"
126814,1,"I have used Huggies for both of my boys and have been pleased with them each time. I've tried other brands, but they just do not stay as dry."
117990,1,"We use a munchkin wipes warmer at home. My baby had really bad diaper rash during the 2nd week, so we switched from disposable wipes to using cloth wipes with a wipe warmer. Then we started to travel a little bit when he turned 1 month old and we quickly realized that we needed a wipes warmer for him when travel. This Dex Baby travel wipes warmer is a great product because it can be used in the car and to a wall outlet. We have ours plugged in at all time. When we travel, we plug it in the car and plug it to the wall outlet when we arrive at grandma's. It holds about 5-6 wipes (we use wash cloth) at a time - we roll up our wipes and not stacking them. All the wipes stay equally warm for a long time because the heating surface is on the top. We are planning to use this at the day care beginning tomorrow as well. We make up a bunch of cloth wipes and store them in the munchkin wipes warmer and transfer 5-6 to this Dex baby to be sent to day care daily. It is a great product and we definitely wish we'd known about this product earlier."
140846,0,"Here is my overall review of this product. If you want to read my personal experience, it is in another review.ADVANTAGES:Excellent style and portabilityThe flat back on the breast cups stick out far less than any other pump, and you can actually place them under your bra for hands-free pumping.Milk can't back up into the tubing (a major problem with the Medela)Pretty good customer serviceDISADVANTAGES:It is kind of a pain to disassemble and reassemble the breast cups every time you use them.There is only one size of breast cup, so if it doesn't work for you, you are out of luck.This is a pretty good pump overall, but I feel it is safer to buy from a company who specializes in breastpumps and has been making them for years (such as Medela). They just have more knowledge and more accessories to make their pumps work for anyone.I think this pump would work great for most women, but MAKE ABSOLUTE SURE IT IS WHAT YOU WANT BEFORE YOU OPEN IT. I would suggest talking to people who own the products you are considering so you can maybe see them and compare."
28652,1,We love how this looks in the baby's nursery and when a small pillow for lumbar support is used in this chair it is super comfortable! It is a very good deal and great product for the price!
57463,1,"As I was looking at this product, all I could find was pink, so Amazon saved the day! This product fits the infant's body very well and has alot of support. It is soft, yet study. I love it!"
110205,1,Fits everything and works wonderfully! I was so excited to find OEM replacement parts to swap out and extend the life of my pump!
140411,1,"Was very useful (essential really) when our boy was younger. The plug feature meant that we didn't have to keep putting batteries in the thing. No, it isn't cheap, but we thought it was worth every penny."
154196,1,"We love these wipes! If you use these, you can't find a better price than here! I priced them locally at stores as well as online vendors. You also get the ease of home delivery. One case usually gets us through the month, occasionally I have to buy a pack from the store. Our son is 9 months."
183057,0,"Good if you have a small baby, if you are not tall, and not carrying anything with you."
181027,1,"Never really looked at other play mats out there- I knew that this was the one I wanted. My sister-in-law has had a lot of success this and her two kids, and my son seems to love it also. I have added some of my own toys to the mat from Lamaze, etc. to increase the interest for my son. The only thing I dont like is the direction the mirror was pointing. So, I moved it."
103835,1,"We have a VERY large home (10,000 sq ft plus on 3/4 levels) and we have a VERY advanced audio visual system with Cat 5 lines and multiple wireless outlets. Well, we had gone through 5 wireless monitors and NONE of them worked. So we spent over $10K hard wiring our nursery to watch our baby through our televisions. Yet, we had to be in front of a TV to listen or see her -- this left us immobilized. This product produced ZERO interference and picks up no background noise. You WILL NOT be sorry! One of the best products we own."
123899,0,"I liked this seat for a few reasons: because of the weight range it can be used for, the carseat harness option, the cupholder, pillow, and it fit well in my jeep. It worked great as a carseat.But, then we switched it to a booster. It was difficult for me to buckle. Then, we got a different car. It still fits great, but when I reach over to buckle her in, I almost fall into the car. And, she has trouble reaching to buckle herself.The padding is thin, but she has never complained. The pillow was not very helpful, and the seat does not give very good head support if she falls asleep.All in all, it is a good seat. But, I will not get one like this when my son needs a booster seat."
141988,1,"I was so pleased when I received this, as the paint was starting to chip off my babies crib where he was biting it. I checked out a few products and thought this sounded the best and they do not disappoint.Perfect, does exactly what is needed from it. So easy and quick to put on, I bought 3 packs, one either side and cut one apck in half for either end. Easy to cut with scissors and sticks down great, no corners peeling back and thick so no matter how strong your babies bite it, won't get through. What I love the most if that when you walk in the room, you can't see this installed on the crib, as it's clear and blends straight in.Just wish I'd bought them sooner!"
146438,1,My brother bought one of these for my nephew who is at the time of writing five and a half months old. The little one loves it and though he still gets exhausted quite quickly (he's not yet sitting) will play in it as long as he can. It's ideal for the child who can't yet sit or walk but is desperate to do so.I have to say it causes a fair amount of entertainment for the adults as well especially when baby's playing in it! The action of the feet when he's bouncing is very funny.
180677,1,"These deliver as promised - easy to use & wash, no leaking, cute, grandma-friendly! But I prefer the bumGenius one-size pockets because they have a more finished, professional look. Other than my personal preference for looks, you can't go wrong with these."
119812,1,"My daughter is a chubby baby with those cute little baby leg rolls. I started out with the Bumbo, but found that even at 4 months, the leg slots were too narrow, and if I tried to pick her up, the seat came with her. She hated the Bumbo, probably because she couldn't move her legs at all. I took it back and gave this one a try. She loved this seat! A bonus is that the tray actually attaches to the seat, unlike the Bumbo.As far as the stinky smell, I must have been one of the lucky ones, because mine didn't stink at all. I think the previous reviewer was talking about phthalates, and the seat is phthalate and bpa free (according to Prince Lionheart). Anyway, I didn't have a stink issue with my seat."
105337,1,I have been using my champ for 2 1/2 years now and I still LOVE IT. After my son turned a year old I did start to notice that his stinky diapers were getting stinkier and the odor was starting to leak out. We'd clean it or spray Lysol but now we have found the solution. GLAD has come out with odor protection trash bags. Use one of these instead of a regular trash bag and you will never smell anything foul coming from the Champ again.
117775,0,"I bought this because I remembered that we had them growing up and loved them. This one works just fine, but after seeing how much he loves the other bouncers (not the ones that hang from the door) we wished we could throw this one away (we just hate to waste the $$) so it'll probably go to Grandma's house."
167693,1,"My husband and I purchased the whole set which included the crib, combo unit and chest. The pieces are pricey however our angel is worth it. All the pieces are made from a good sturdy wood. Purchasing these pieces are an investment because of the high quality. These are pieces my daughter can take to her first apartment. I would recommend the whole set to anyone looking for quality furniture."
77034,0,"I want to start out by saying I LOVE the features of this swing! We had one just like it but pink for our daughter, so when we found out we were having another boy, I knew right away I wanted this swing. With batteries it has a power save that turns it off, so you won't kill your batteries, but we mostly used the power cord since it never left the house (we used batteries when our power was out or if our older kids switched it over haha. The netting makes the lights dance, and seemed to make our son feel more secure when he was much smaller. The papasan seat is his favorite place, and it quickly became his favorite place to nap, or just to sit if I needed to vacume the floor, when our daughter had her's she was the SAME WAY! It's easy to clean the cover and the straps are tricky, but once I figured out a method that worked for me (a cheap toothbrush, some lysol, and a bowl of warm water... I know you mommies and daddies know what I was scrubbing, should I really have to go into detail??). The lights and moving mobile are amazing and cute, and the different directions of motion will make you almost hear angels sing... but don't be fooled, thats probably one of the many sounds this thing has! The only obvious con's are it's huge, you really need plenty of space or it will bump into stuff, and if the legs can't fully spread, I would think it may make it capable of tiping (though it never happened to us... we have a smaller house, but we made room for this giant because it really is THAT worth it...) and the ""toy bar"" might as well get thrown away. By the time your baby will be old enough to use it, their legs may not fit comfortably under it, and honestly, it's boring. I love this swing....-BUT-The reason I can't give it the 5 stars it deserves is because we purchased this one last feb or march through Amazon, it wasn't used (or assembled) until June 2nd when Jaydon was 4 days old and we came home from the hospital. Second to in my arms, it was his favorite place in the world. Unfortunatly by October I noticed it seemed as if it was slowing down, and just to have a gentle sway, it had to be on high. The pink one we had could sway that hard on the first or second setting. It struggled for a few more months, and in January the swing quit all together. The lights and everything else still work fine, so he still likes to sit in it or take little naps in it, but I can't put him in it anymore because I'm afraid for his safety. Last week I was looking at it and noticed the motor housing is pulling away from the top of the swing. If I could get a refund or a new swing (hopefully it's just this one, since the pink one was a tank!), I would probably change my review. Fisher Price was been of NO help, so hopefully Amazon can make my poor baby stop crying ""wing wing wing..."" in the most sad little voice I've ever heard."
142689,1,Very soft and warm. Holds up well against a lot of washes.Have had for a a couple of months now.
133302,2,"These bottles worked great at first. I primarily breastfed my baby, but used these for times that I needed to bottle feed. My baby did great going from breast to bottle - never had any problems. The valve seemed to help with eliminating gas - never had colic issues are anything like that. However, lately I have had a lot of problems with my plastic Born Free bottle leaking. It's fine while my baby is drinking out of it, but as soon as I tip it upright, milk starts leaking down the side. I made terrycloth ""sleeves"" out of old towels to handle the mess because we're nearing the end of bottle feeding and I don't want to buy anything new. I didn't have this problem at first, so it might be something with the valve inside (I read somewhere that the bottle can leak if the valve slit gets torn and it looks like mine is). I used to have a glass version of this bottle and I don't remember having problems with that one, but it may have been prior to the problems I've had with the plastic one (again...probably a valve issue). Buyer beware. Most plastic bottles are now BPA free and there are other glass options. I don't think I'd buy these again."
157317,1,My husband just put this changing table together for me and i love it! I watched him put it together and it seemed pretty easy to him but i guess that depends on how well you follow directions. All the parts were there. The drawers are a little small but its good for my daughters clothes. And its very sturdy. All in all a great piece of furniture.
126133,0,"These diapers work for the most part, but stink when baby urinates in them. Other diapers including cloth don't do that. We have had occasional leaks with the Huggies brand of diapers also."
137404,2,"Too thick, to short, and uncomfortable. I had a different body pillow before that I loved, but didn't want to spend $100 on a new one, so I got the cheapy based on these recommendations, I used it once and I HATE IT.1. OVER filled so you are propped up in weird places (your head is high, and legs are high, while your center is drooping down).2. Cover does not go back on once it is washed it is HORRIBLE. It is cut so there are larger and smaller parts on the cover, my husband and I both could not get this thing back on.3. the curve at the neck base is sharp so you either have to have your arm over the top so you can rest your head on it or you have to scoot way down so it doesn't cut into your shoulders.4. Base is too thick to support your belly5. Fluffing or flattening the pillow doesn't work, it is stuffed to the max5. I am 5'3 and it comes to the top of my knees on one side and if it is cutting into my shoulder in the top it will come to my lower back.6. To keep your whole hip/let supported you need to have your legs really bent as shown the pictures.7. It doesn't fold up or lay neatly anywhere8. Not breathableSPEND THE EXTRA $40 AND BUY THE COMFORT U WITH FIBER FILL, IT BREATHS, IS ADJUSTABLE WITH THE THICKNESS IN AREAS, AND IS LONG ENOUGHT TO COVER YOUR WHOLE BODY. FOLDS IN 2 SO THAT YOU CAN PLACE IT UNDER YOUR PILLOWS WITH YOU MAKE YOUR BED..... I WISH I WOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THAT..."
109427,2,"We bought one of these Muchkin Fresh Food Feeders from Target and it worked OK the first time we used it. My daughter loved 'eating' with us at dinner time and there was no concern for her chocking on the apples we gave her...but after that it was all downhill. These feeders are fairly hard to open, and since it's not a screw closure you have no way of tightening it less or more. Secondly, the mesh bags do not come out of the feeders so you'll be hard pressed to ever get all the food bits cleaned out. I would soak our feeder overnight and still not be able to get all the left over food out of it. We have since boutht the Sassy brand feeders and they are much better. The mesh net comes all the way out and is much easier to clean. Plus, you can buy replacement nets so you can get rid of them as often and you feel comfortable with. In the end I will only use the Sassy brand mesh feeders and have thrown out my Muchkin feeder."
13172,2,I found this to be difficult to use and it never got the car seats tight enough. I took them both back and feel much safer using the old fashioned locking clips. The locking clips always get my car seats in tight with no room to move.
183692,1,"The design of this backpack is not only compact and easy to carry, but also offers a surprising amount of storage. I really like the different pockets for storage, and the removable changing pad. As a first time parent, I have found it very helpful."
134805,1,"I ordered the bedding set online after calling Babies R Us and being told it was available only online. A few weeks later I found the bedding set, mobile, and lamp at Toys R Us. I wish I could have known and saved the $15 in shipping costs. That savings would have almost bought the $19.99 lamp! I reccommend going to Toys R Us if possible because that way you can see and feel the bedding in person. Its a great value for the price but not as nice as some other sets that are available."
158630,1,"We swaddled our first son too long and it was really hard to transition him out of it. With our second son, we're switching to the sleep sack much earlier and it has worked very well. We love these!"
150994,0,"We purchased this table shortly after our daughter's birth and have been satisfied with the quality for the money. It's sturdy and has held up well. One consideration that I wish I would have thought of though is that the open shelves are only good for storage until your baby is mobile. Now that our daughter is pulling herself up on furniture, we can no longer store anything under the table. She pulls everything off and tosses it around the room. I wish we'd spent a little more and bought a changing table with enclosed storage underneath."
173571,1,"This was an excellent swing, I only wish they made it to hold a baby until past 22 lbs. When my son was sick a few times I put him in it to sleep at night so that he nasal passages stayed clear. Sleeping upright allowed him to breathe easier, what a lifesaver. But on the whole as a swing it is wonderful. I remember the first time my son spotted the birdies above :)"
57979,2,"While I found having a bottle warmer in our 2nd floor nursery to be invaluable, this particular one is not the one to buy. We only used the heating component as we had a mini fridge (tabletop size) for bottles for our twins. THe problem is that it has no way to alter the amount of water depending on the amount of milk you want to heat up. As a result, it is very easy to overheat the milk and that is incredibly frustrating after you have been bouncing your baby while waiting to heat up the milk. The amount of water in the little container is only sufficient for an 8 oz bottle and my kids still don't drink 8 oz at one time at 5 months of age nor do they need bottles at night anymore."
149543,1,I bought this for the car but ended up using it in my child's nursery. Fit perfectly in her changing station.
146401,1,"I bought this for my 4-month old son and he absolutely loves it. I can get him to spend more than an hour bouncing around. This leaves quite a bit of time for me to get things done around the house. The swivel seat is the best. As soon as he gets bored with a toy, he just turns to the next one. Love it, love it, love it."
60490,1,I wish I would have bought this tub from day 1!!!It is great my daughter loves it she likes to relax in the section that you can lay back and she is 9 months old and still sits there well. She does not even fidget she just enjoys her bath.She has a lot of hair and IT makes rinsing her hair out so much easier!!It is a LARGE tub you could probably fit an infant and a toddler in it....
180927,0,"My son is 5 months now and he's enjoyed the mat the whole time. I've never changed the batteries and the music stays on for quite a while, so there's no running over to reset it.He's rolling over and pulling at everything and stays on it for about 30 mins solid each time, which is nice.It really bothers me that the butterflies on top do not spin. They just sit there, blocking 1/2 of the blinking lights. He doesn't pay any mind to the little things sewn into the mat itself, just the things dangling. I did take off a few of the toys and added my own, which he likes. The parrot does nothing, and the monkey does nothing, but he likes the other parts.I guess I'm happy if he's happy, but I feel like there's probably a better choice out there."
62068,2,"I wish I would have read the reviews before buying, although I didn't think I had to since I've been diapering twins for over 3 years. These run too small. The ""size 5"" is not as big as expected and definately smaller than huggies. I also didn't realize the sides were not resealable. I bought 2 and am returning 1."
29358,0,"Color didn't really match the nursery, but decent valances nonetheless. A little pricey for the quality."
102967,1,"I received this as a gift at my baby shower and was a little skeptical. However, I liked the idea of it not using special, costly refills. Mine worked great! It holds a lot of diapers and does keep the smell out. Every once in a while I would sprinkle some baking soda in the basket for extra odor control. This product worked so well for us that even though our son is now 4 and no longer needs the diaper pail, we empty used cat litter clumps in it to reduce smell and it works perfectly!"
92704,2,"I have a side-by-side fridge, so I put this on the top. While lined up correctly, the pieces totally miss each other - the ""catch"" is too high to actually stop the bottom piece."
98874,0,"Smell like baby powder, even when full of pee or poo, maybe a good thing for some, but I am sensitive to smells and it makes me sneeze.They hold, only have had a few leaks and usually only if it was an hour or so between changings. Definitely don't live up to up to 12 hour protection though. That is laughable...(but who really lets their kid sit in a diaper that long?)"
97830,1,"My son was very fussy when he was new and had lots of gas. I had about seven or so of these bottles from an inlaw. I decided to use them and no gas and no more fussy baby. I continued to use them up until this month. I have no time for bottles with so many parts. My son is crawling and pulling up..so I am busy all the time. The bottles are great!!! I never in the seven months had a leak problem the wasn't strickly human error (mostly by my husband). It is a good idea to put them back to gether when clean they do consume time if you are in a hurry. You can buy replacement parts in my area( the nipple and bottom seals). Great bottle, Great buy!!!!"
66813,1,"I LOVE the BOB handlebar console for Duallie Strollers! It holds 2 water bottles perfectly, so even when I am running very fast there are no spills or mishaps. The zippered pouch is perfectly placed in the middle so that it is easily accessible, even when I am running. It holds a LOT of stuff, including my wristlet wallet, IPhone, IPod, and gum!It is so easy to install onto the stroller and very durable. Also, rain just bounces off of it instead of absorbing into the material. I give this fabulous product an A+++++!"
181851,1,"I received this as a gift for my son who is now four months. It is full of useful (and great smelling) products, and is roomy enough to put all of his other bathtime &quot;essentials&quot; in. It is easy to open/close, but stays securely shut when not in use. The handle on the top is also a great feature. I have no complaints-this would make a great gift for any expectant parent!"
31763,0,"The table is very attractive and appears to be well made but it is extremely small. The table is very small in diameter and very low to the ground. It was my own fault for not checking the specs but the pictures of this item are deceiving. For the price, I do not think this toy lives up to expectations. I will be returning it tomorrow."
57016,1,"This gate was very easy for my husband to install and it looks nice. I love the fact that this gate is strong and swings both ways. It will close behind you or you can push it all the way to stay open. In less than 24 hours, our 17 month old son figured out how to unlatch the gate and laughed at my husband! My husband tighten the tension for swinging door so now we just have to press a little harder to open the gate, which I don't mind since now my little bam-bam isn't quite strong enough to get through it right now, but he still tries. :) My husband was impressed with the quality of the gate, so we will buy this same gate for the bottom of the stairs. Money well spent and at good price here on amazon with 1-click shipping!"
16163,1,"I am super impressed by this picnic blanket. I can't say enough good about it. I would recommend it to anyone. Perfect for picnics on wet or damp grass, the beach, whatever! Nothing sticks to it, it is super easy to wipe off, the top part with the design is soft and comfortable, and it is awesome as its own carrying case. So happy with this purchase."
92025,1,"This is the only locking clip that I found that actually works for more than a day! We've had the car seat installed with it for a couple of weeks now and I haven't had to adjust it once! Awesome little device, I would highly recommend it to anyone."
81140,1,I used this for bringing clean cloth diaper to daycare and dirty diaper home. This is a very cute and useful bag. Only hand wash them because it is not really very heavy-duty bag. I love using it everyday. It is a good product.
65586,2,"I bought this a few years ago because I wanted a lightweight stroller to travel with my then 2 1/2 year old son and it seemed the perfect solution. The reclining is great and the basket holds a lot. Yet, there are some very IMPORTANT DESIGN ERRORS.Right after I got it we noticed that turning it was very difficult, and driving it with one hand, impossible. It makes you bump into everyone and always makes for clumsy driving, no matter what you do. We took it to the warranty site and they said they replaced the front wheels. It is still the same!!!I now have a 1 year old girl who inherited this difficult stroller. (only because we spent so much on it that we feel terrible buying another one but we will now because I can't stand it any longer).With my little girl using it since 3 months old, I got to understand how this stroller has some good ratings. It was like a different stroller. UNITIL SHE GOT TO A CERTAIN WEIGHT (not the limit, trust me, she is still 20lbs). It is not that it gets to be difficult to drive from the amount of use. It is that, when the baby is up to about 7 to 8 mo old, driving it is wonderful. BUT, WHEN THE BABY GAINS SOME WEIGHT, IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN.So to all who are happy with it. Just wait!!!! And to those who haven't bought it, try another one!!!!"
8076,1,Exact replacements - I bought these as extras to keep at work so I didn't have to lug so much stuff back and forth. Works great!
55841,0,"The measurement of water on all warmers are really hard to estimate. This one especially because you couldn't see the fill lines. The timer did go off, but rarely was the bottle I put in it at the end. Pulling the plug in and out was annoying. sometimes the bottle would be too hot and I had to use thongs to take it out. I ended up returning it and now am trying out the Especially for Baby one."
85914,0,"I was very disappointed in the condition of the baby monitor. I have purchased a lot of products from Amazon and never had a bad situation. It was not shipped in the original package with no instructions. It was scratched and in use condition. On the wedsite, it stated it was new. The damage was not due to shipping. It was packaged in that condition.I reported this to customer service and did'nt receive any reply. This was not the normal treatment that I have received in the past."
181191,1,"I received the item as expected. Happy with my decision. The box it ships in is huge. its double the size, but i'd rather it ship safe than come damaged."
11218,1,"I just received the pack n' play today. I am due in two weeks and the shipping was pretty fast! That was the first plus.This is our third child so we already knew how to put up the pack n' play.You have to play with it a bit. But just slightly push down the middle (bottom), pull up on the short sides first until they lock, then the long sides and push down the bottom completely. You may have to push the white release buttons to be able to pull up on the sides because they may be locked. But this was the easy part.Next you install the bassinet (if you plan to use it). When our first daughter was born we don't remember any pack n' play models with this option. This was also easy to install. At this point you would put the mattress in the bassinet (we put it in the pack n' play part first as this was our normal way of doing things LOL) I really like the bassinet. It's nice and seems comfortable. I purchased the quilted sheet because I read other reviews advising that it can be hard for your little one after normal use.So then you put together that darn changing table. Well this has been a bit hard for us. We know from using infant products that nothing should overlap, nothing should be lose, all pieces and fabric needs to be secure. There is a part on the changing table, opposite the danger warning side, that has been giving us a problem. There is a large piece of fabric with an area for a pole to be inserted, but it seems you have to put so much tension on this part to insert the pole! I will update this review as I just simply got frustrated and said I will do that part later. My seven year old put the mobile together :) It plays music. It's really nice. I gave it four stars because of the difficulty to put the changing table together. It's easy to put it on the pack n' play, but not easy to put it together. Hope this helps for now.Update!!!So I woke up at 2:00 a.m. for a snack and put the changing table together with no problem. I had to remove the short white poles that go into the holes on the actual pack n' play. Then insert the long pole into the sleeve. After that I put the short white poles back on and installed it (easy) onto the pack n' play. It was so easy. I just needed to rest. I did it in about three minutes. I had to use an ink pen to push the little silver pens in to release the pole. Another note: I did not purchase the pack n' play with the diaper and wipes holder. This is just a basic one."
112177,1,"I've been purchasing our pampers swaddlers/cruisers from amazon.com since our daughter was born and although the price has been slowly creeping up, the one thing that I've noticed is that the inventory seems to be old.Pampers has recently added a MESH LINING to their cruisers line (I found this out by accident when we had to do an emergency run to our local, overpriced drugstore) and boy is it unbelievable. Our daughter could sit in her carseat and sleep at night longer. It basically keeps her bottom away from the wetness. It just looks high-tech!For some reason though, the last three orders I've received from amazon.com have not had the mesh lining. I'm hoping at some point they'll finally use up their old inventory and start bulk packaging the new line but until then, be forewarned. We're getting a discount on pricing, but it's not the latest inventory."
70251,1,Boought this stoller for my 18 month old twins. It is easy to steer and really lightweight. My twins have cerebral palsy and my son has a really high tone. Have special strollers but needed one for when I have both of them with me. This serves the purpose for taking both of them to the doctor by myself.Super easy to fold and handle.Kinda seems a little cheaply made and the basket underneath does not hold anything hardly.The 5 point harness system could really use improvement. The top of the harness is plastic and slips into a sewed on strap. Comes out very easy. That is my only biggest complaint.Would not recomment on gravel or on grass.
29255,1,Very happy with this product.....very well made very pleased....haven't used it yet but ready for our grandsons with the toilet training.
133336,2,"I've had these bottles for almost a year now and know everything about them.- They are solidly constructed of good materials and last- They are annoying clean because they have five parts and are difficult to disassemble.- They are annoying to assemble because they have five parts, and if you don't take care putting the bottle together just so...- They LEAK!If you don't get everything *just right* then the bottles LEAK. They leak upside down on the baby, right side up to leave rings on tables, and in general are just a total mess. Just think of how often you're going to be holding the baby in one hand and trying to assemble the bottle with the other hand, at 2am in the dark of night, with no sleep for the past week."
177924,2,"I purchased 2 of these, which by the way are not exactly the cheapest sippy cup to buy, but I wanted something that would keep my son's milk cold while we are away from the house. One worked ok, minimal leaks - nothing is leak ""proof"" and the other poored milk all over. I took it apart and reassemble it many times thinking the seal in the lid wasn't fitting right and nothing worked. The darn thing leaked milk all inside my purse while we were on vacation. So we found ourselves on a insulated sippy cup search on our vacation. Not exactly what I wanted to be doing on vacation. So I gave 2 stars because one of them worked ok and the other was completely useless."
35198,2,Our son is 17 lbs. and is almost 5 months old. The packaging says 15-22 lbs.(for the Large size) No way! I tried to attach the velcro pieces and it can only go half way around his little body and the velcro pieces can't attach. The concept is good but doesn't work. I ended up just going back to swaddling him with a large receiving blanket. If anyone knows of a better product for swaddling please comment on my review. Thanks.
179225,1,"I have seen many people comment that the nipples for Stage 1 did not give their babies enough milk...I also had the same problem at first, but all it took to fix it was to squeeze the tip of the nipple and it opened up the slit to let the milk flow properly. So instead of giving up on VentAir bottles or jumping to Stage 2 nipples too early try this idea. We LOVE these bottles...you can read my other review if you want all my thoughts on them!"
71526,1,"Everyone thought I had lost my mind when I told them how much I was going to pay for a stroller when my first baby was coming. No one thinks that now. We used the bassinet anytime we were away from home for her naps, just rocked the stroller until she fell asleep and locked the wheels when she passed out. And we never had to use an icky diaper change station, we just changed her in the stroller. I loved being able to see her little face when we were out and about and now she likes to face out to see the world. The locking small wheels are a great feature for trailing and makes using it effortless. We also use it as a highchair at restaurants. The maneuverability is terrific and quick. Perfect for someone like me that's often impatient getting around. I also like the fabric of the frog over the chameleon. The fleece of the chameleon shows pet hair and lint, the frog is more like a nylon backpack and you can easily lay a blanket down is you're seeking a softer surface. I've been using this stroller for 21/2 years and I truly love it. We are having another baby in 3 months and I will be purchasing the wheeled board for my toddler and also another frame so I can easily switch between the bassinet and the regular seat as needed. For the price I wish it would have come with 2 frames (if you purchased the bassinet with it) but I have no complaints otherwise. Even my husband loves it and no one is making fun of me anymore :)"
59233,2,"I registered for and received the Avent bottle warmer simply because I realy like the Avent bottles and assumed the bottle warmer would also live up to my expectations, especially given the price. However, I was sorely disappointed for many reasons already stated in previous reviews. There is no automatic shut off and I have overheated more than one bottle. Can't tell you how many times I have turned the dial to 3 to warm the bottle (in a hurry for hungry baby of course) only to come back a few minutes later to realize I forgot to plug the machine in OR how many times I have forgotten to unplug it and only realize when I go to warm the next bottle. I understand I could use a power strip that I can turn on and off, BUT it's one more thing on my counter and WHY should I have to go the extra effort? Also, you have to use a separate timer (e.g., microwave, kitchen timer, etc.) if you want to hear a beep to let you know the bottle is ready. In a nutshell, it is missing the on/off switch (mine is REALLY new---must have done away with this switch), hate that you can't leave it plugged in, and it doesn't have an auditory signal to let you know your bottle is warm (IF you remembered to plug it in!). I bought the Munchkin brand warmer out of frustration and research that I should have done before hand and I LOVE it. It was exactly HALF the price, you can leave it plugged in (no need for power strip), has an automatic shut off (no overheated bottles), and has an auditory signal that beeps 5 times when the bottle is warm. It works just as quickly and I have never overheated a bottle. Also, it uses steam instead of boiling water, which I like better because when it has completed warming, there is no liquid at all left in the machine to continue heating bottle. Also, it does not take up any more counter space than the Avent warmer. Don't assume more expensive is better because it is certainly not true in this case."
23950,1,"I have been a nanny for over 15 years and always tried to swaddle the babies before they went down for their naps, but could not get the blanket to stay tight for very long. Regular blankets can end up over the babies face if they move around a lot, but this eliminates the fear of SIDS completely.When I became pregnant with my own, I researched online and found this product. I LOVE IT!!! Our daughter has been sleeping through the night since she was 3 weeks old. She is now 10 weeks old and sleeps 9 hours straight.If the ""wrap"" portion of the swaddler rides up a little, place the baby in the blanket a little higher so the shoulders are at the very top. Wrap it low and away from their chin."
126591,2,I have tried several types of diapers. These are one of my least favorites. While they are not bad as far as protecting leaks. I don't like the way the diaper looks once it is wet. It looks very uncomfortable to me and is rather hard. My son is always on the go and needs a diaper that moves with him.
141132,1,"My nephew really enjoys playing with this toy. He mostly enjoys pushing the buttons and hearing the different sounds. He also uses it to pull up on and is able to walk with it now. However, it is relatively easy to pull the walker over so he has fallen and it landed on top of him several times. I would recommend only using it as a walker when the child is very close to walking or you are right beside them to make sure the child does not pull it over. Overall he has thoroughly enjoyed this toy and at 11 months he is now able to use the walker effectively!"
175986,1,This carrier is great!my newborn loves it. The fabric does tend to stretch a bit but i'm sure it'll snap back after a wash.
135104,1,"I ordered this kit to carry in my backpack while hiking in the backcountry where rattlesnakes are a very real threat. As it happened, I was stung by a bee and decided to try it on my hand. After I flicked off the stinger, I used the smallest tip and suctioned at the point of the sting. It appeared to draw out a little venom? and within a few minutes I had no pain or swelling at all from the sting. Very small and easy to carry. Definetely a good investment, and worth the peace of mind if you are too far away to get any medical attention in case of a bite or sting."
162452,1,"Great Service, Fast Shipping, Great Communication.Highly Recommend this seller."
148018,0,"We were given two of these for my first child and we decided to keep both so we had one to use at grandma's house. Both bars began clicking when the frogs would slide up and down after just a few months of use. My husband was able to disassemble the frogs so we didn't deal with the click. Four years later we are having our second child and my husband was able to place a ""cushion"" on the clicking gear to eliminate the sound. The baby isn't here yet, so we are waiting to see how this new adjustment will work. I would suggest looking into purchasing a different seat if you don't want to deal with the extra headaches."
144269,1,"Never underestimate the importance of a small plastic bag! Especially when traveling, a stinky diaper or sticky trash can be a nuisance if you have nothing to dispose it in. I place a bag into the seat pocket on airplanes, so that we have a trash bag nearby for the entire flight. I also attach it to the zipper of my bag for easy transport and access. The 3 stars for durability are due to it being a disposable item. This item is not educational or fun - (Amazon requires a star rating in these categories for this item).Bag-It Disposable Trash Bags are a ""JetWithKids"" recommended product!"
53399,1,"This product is easy to fold up and attach to most counter surfaces (kitchen; dining table). It's a little tricky to unlatch (I worry about pinched fingers), and I don't like the surface being sleazy material that isn't easy to clean. But for the price, it's a very good deal in a portable kid's chair that supports a child up to 37 lbs. My grandson is 28 lb. (2+ years old) and he still fits it fine."
44112,2,I bought this because my granddaughter fell and scraped her face on the faucet in the bath tub and by appearance it looked like it would cover the majority of the faucett and keep her from getting hurt again. The problem is that we have excellant water pressure and when the water is on it shoots off the faucett - when the water is off it slides down to the end and barely hangs on. It has fit the purpose but I would like it better if it stayed in place.Grami
159759,1,"Our son has enjoyed this bouncer more or less from day one. He loved being able to sit up and see the lights and hear the music. And now, he loves being able to kick or move and make the music work. He smiles the whole time. And when he needs a rest, the vibrating seat works wonders. I do wish that it folded down better for travel, but it does fit in the trunk as is."
121563,1,I bought this for my washable puppy pee pads. It is a great size for the laundry room and helps keep down the odor so I am not embarrassed. It is a little smaller than I expected but it turns out to hold about a weeks worth for one 3 lb yorkie.
104261,1,"I purchasedKidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard, because in our 1980-built townhouse gaps between balusters are wide enough for our one-year-old to fall through. I originally was going to use acrylic sheets (Plexiglas), but, what I saw at a local Home Depot, was too thick and expensive.INSTALLATION:The installation of the Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard was easy, and the plastic seems durable enough to serve for at least a few years. I was able to cut it easily with a utility knife and a metal square. There was enough product included in the box to do all of the areas in my townhouse that were unsafe for my son.Included in the box are a hole-punch, a bunch of white plastic ties, a few plastic grommets, screws, and wall anchors to secure end(s) of the Banister Guard to a wall if needed. I bought a pack of black plastic ties at Harbor Freight Tools because wrought iron on my stairs is painted black and the included white ties would stand out. I did not use the hole-punch, because it can make holes only about ""- "" from the edge of the plastic, and for my installation it would not work, so I just used my utility knife to make small slits for plastic ties.TO BE CONSIDERED:1. I was unpleasantly surprised by the fact that the leading edge was not cut squarely at the factory. When I measured the same distance from both corners of the leading edge and tried using a square to connect the marks, I noticed that the cut would not be at a right angle. Therefore, I had to cut the leading edge square first and re-measure.2. When I imagined installed product, I thought of it as being practically invisible. However, even though I installed the plastic as tightly as I could, it still has some unevenness to it that causes reflection and distortion and makes it noticeable; although, this is an aesthetics issue, which is not as important as my child's safety.CONCLUSION:Overall, Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard satisfied my requirements: it provides the safety I needed for my child, it is relatively inexpensive, it seems durable, it is easy to install."
105061,0,This product is good. My baby no longer scratches her belly on the corner of our hearth. The adhesive is TERRIBLE. I was finding the strips of foam all over my house and it became super annoying. My husband bought some PL 300 foam adhesive and now it is immoveable. I was told that the brick will remain unharmed with the foam adhesive but it's on there pretty good! The product is fine- just gotta find a way to keep it on there!
18834,1,"My daughter loves this little bed--it is low to the floor, durable and stylish. It was a struggle to put together--instructions were very vague, but after two hours and a few words of frustration, we finally had a great todler bed. My daughter climbs into it at night, kisses us goodnight, and sleeps all night happily. I would buy this bed again, and again, and again!"

93144,0,"Pros:Good size for toddlers, Lightweight, Seems sturdyCons:Has a band that stretches across the middle that makes sleeping on it uncomfortable (according to my son). Plan on using a camping mat, piece of foam cushion, etc. so it doesn't feel like an uncomfortable sofa bed where the bar cuts into your back."
157530,0,"Luckily my husband was the one who put this together because it took several hours. Once he got his power drill it was a lot easier, but very time consuming. It works great, but took a long time to assemble."
164460,0,"I tried these because it says Baby Dry on the box and my 1 year old floods these and all his bedding by morning. So, I don't really care for them."
153886,2,"I tried the Seventh Generation wipes because I am trying to be more green. I would also prefer to shield my child from as many chemicals as possible. However, these wipes are just not worth it. They are too dry. In fact, you have to use more than the standard brand, which defeats part of the purpose of using them."
93143,0,"I purchased the Regalo My Cot online for my 2 year old granddaughter. When the cot was opened up, it seemed to have two sides because there was a tight strap going across the middle of the cot, the short way. I called the company and they sent me a new one right away. Unfortunately the new one is much the same. Too bad."
81982,1,"I've used these for two babies now and have used the milk after 6mo in deep freeze.They are great most of the time. I freeze about 10-12oz in each bag (yes, they say no more than 6oz, it's a myth). 12 is the maximum I found tho. The trick is to make sure there is no air. It won't leak b/c the bag will expand, unlike plastic storage containers. I use the straight edge of a table, push the milk all the way to the top and zip it as I push the air out. Don't worry if a little leaks out b/c it has a double zipper. Then I freeze it on a flat surface singly. After it's frozen, I put 8-10 of these in a big gallon zip lock bag and date the outside and put it in deep freezer. It's easier to organize them this way in deep freeze.The bad thing about these bags is that once frozen, the plastic nicks easily if you drop it, scrape it against something, etc (as with all frozen containers). Lansinoh had really bad problem with leakage before but they've improved. Just thaw the bag in a container in case it leaks. Lansinoh customer service is great and will replace them if you encounter leaky bags."
118086,2,"So after researching over a month for the right car bed for my son, I decided to trust the reviews here and get Step 2 convertable car bed. The bed came in huge box without anything to protect the (cheap) plastic parts. Needless to say, the pieces had scratches all over them. Next, I see that the bag of the decals is ripped open and the all the stickers are wrinkled!!! I mean, are you kidding me? you ship me a bed that obviously someone probably opened and returned to the warehouse?!!! I can't believe that for this price I just payed, this is what I got. We were so looking forward to have my son sleep on it tonight and now I have to wait till Monday to call them up. Oh, and not to mention that the company does not deliver it all the way to your door, so if you are like me, and lives in an apartment building, they only bring it to the front of the building and you need to figure out how to carry it in. I am beyond pissed at the condition of the bed and will contact them first thing on Monday to demand an explanation. I will give an update soon..."
17316,1,"We were lucky enough to receive this as a shower gift from some very dear friends, and to be honest would probably not have one otherwise. Having said that, I now wouldn't want to be without it, it is a really good piece of equipment.You can use it with or without the screen on (particularly good at night) and it is fairly portable and lightweight. The base unit is easy to install and unobtrusive, and it seems very well made. I've had mine now over 16 months, and considering that it is on EVERY day, it looks built to last. Two minor points to remember though - If you have a lot of Portable telephones in your house on the same frequency (900Mhz) or Wireless computer adapters at the same frequency you can, and do often get interference on the sound and picture quality, when they are in use (phones especially). Also, at times I need to reposition the screen in certain rooms to improve reception (possibly due to wiring or other interference) These two things aside it's a great buy - If you consider that most regular monitors (without picture) are almost $60, it's really not that much more to spend. I highly recommend this product."
83077,1,"Love this basinet liner. I have an oooold basinet that belonged to my sister that suits it's purpose but wasn't as pretty anymore after so many years. This covers the entire basinet and is a beautiful, simple cover."
164581,1,"This is by far the best diaper ever!!! I love Pampers! I've tried others and my son always leaked out of them, but with Pampers Baby Dry, it's happened maybe twice in the last 6 months! Although expensive, they are so worth my son not leaking out! In this case, you really do get what you pay for."
130022,1,We bought these rails to convert our Emily crib (Espresso) to a full bed. They work great. The conversion process was fairly painless. The full bed looks good. We are happy with it.
174279,2,I thought I was getting a crib mattress cover as the picture shows. However when it arrived it was a cover for a bassinette matress. I returned the item and had to pay $5 shipping.
41270,1,"My little girl has been in pampers since the day she was born and I love them! Even in the awkward crawling stage we didn't have any leaks.Once she got to be 9-10 months and still taking a night time bottle we did have some leaks at night, and then I started using huggies overnights only because I could not find a similar pampers product.We never had a problem with the mesh lining, but my daughter has had some bad diaper rashes, the worst were actually strep infections on her skin and I don't think the best diaper could have prevented them.I also have never had a problem with the silica lining coming out, but I do know for a fact that the lining is NOT poisonous. I had a friend whose son insisted on chewing the diapers and she called poison control to find out.We have started to switch up to pull ups 2/3T for overnight and naps now that we are potty training and they also work great! No leaks and my daughter thinks they are underpants."
61483,1,I was extremely displeased with this purchase. So much static I could barely hear what was going on ...BUT!!!! after I plugged the receptor in an outlet AWAY from my Pc ...IT works PERFECTLY...GREAT PURCHASE...Just keep away from COMPUTER!!!
1703,2,These diapers do not have a stretchy wastband. Poop frequently runs up my childs back!!! I will never use these diapers again because of all the extra laundry and mess they created for me.
175563,1,"I was concerned about the wording ""flame retardant"" in the materials description on the Halo Website. I just spoke with a customer service rep at the company and she confirmed they are NOT treated with any chemicals and that the 100% polyester is itself flame resistant.Good news"
117423,1,I purchased this so friends who have babies can have a place to feed them while at my home without having to invest in a high chair. So far it has worked wonderfully with the 1 year old on my dining room table might just become my go to gift for new parents. It's great for its price point. Just don't think I will ever get it back in the carry bag that comes with it.
150215,1,I LOVE this cover and wish I had only gotten this one. It is so soft and absorbent! It is also nice and warm every time I put my son on it because of the material. It washes well and it perfect in my opinion!!
23099,1,"If you use the Medela Breast bump don't forget to buy these membrans as well, as the more you bump the more you will need to replace the membrane."
55838,0,"Overall this product works as documented/expected. The only reason for not giving a full 5 star rating is that the heating is not consistent. Even if you use the amount of water as recommended in the documentation, the heating is not consistent. The milk will be too hot or too cold occasionally. I wish they had perfected the heating time based on actual temperature of the contents."
95650,1,I have purchased one of these for myself and then got another one for a gift. It is perfect storage for stuffed animals! Its a space saver and a durable product!!
50385,1,"only slept on it one night, but really enjoy it. i agree that it is expensive, but pillows all around are expensive... usually. this is comfortable and cradles my whole body... it does interfere with being close to anyone else in the bed... it forms a cocoon around me... but so far, i am enjoying that!"
87396,1,I love these bottles. They don't leak like some other ones I've tried and they don't let any air in while baby is feeding. The only thing is you have to loosen the nipple at the end to see how much the baby has drank. Also there is not enough room on the liners to mix the formula inside the bottle. Other than that my son and I are very happy.
173830,1,"We bought this swing originally because it was the newest and nicest one available. Little did we know what a life saver it would become. At first our new born seemed to small and to fragile for its fast motions, so we stoped using it. By age 7 weeks little boy was only sleeping ontop of me at night and no where else. I thought I was going to fall out of my own skin if I couldnt get a little sleep by my self. We had tried every thing from letting him sleep in his pram to putting his car seat in the bed with us but none of these options worked. We even ordered an Austrailian baby hammock bed but again even this didnt work. Only mommys chest was working as a bed for little boy. Out of desperation one day I pulled the 'Happiest baby on the block' DVD out... which I hadnt re-watched since I was pregnant.....Oh how we forget the little things! So I told my husband ''lets go back to swaddeling and put him in his swing to sleep at night and see if that will work''. OH MY HEAVENS HE SLEPT 6.5 HOURS STRAIGHT!!!!! He had never done that before. Now he is 11 weeks old and still sleeping 6-7 hours straight at night. When he wakes I feed and change him, then re-swaddle him and back to the swing where he will sleep another good 3 hours. This swing and the 'Happiest baby on the block' DVD(what new mom has time to read)have been my sanity savers. I highly recomend. Good luck new moms!!!"
153230,1,Great product. My wife and I wanted something a little fresher and hip than the backpack style of bag we had with our first. Plus my wife wanted more pockets. This did everything we wanted and more.
123884,1,I purchased these bags before I went back to work so I could pump and still give my baby breast milk. I typically store between 3 and 4oz and have never had an issue with leaking. I store them in separate container in our freezer and then thaw them out in warm water and I have never had an issue with them. These are wonderful and I would highly recommend them!
24521,1,"Very sturdy/easy to use baby gate. One thing to notice is the length is just big enough for doorways but not much else, so make sure to measure!"
123437,1,"I really am very pleased with the pack and play PLAYYARD that i recently purchased from Amazon.com/ I take care of my 2 grandsons and the youngest is a little over 1 yr and not walking. Well to be very honest, I am a little too old to be chasing the little one all over my house. (he is really FAST ). When my kids were his age, I did have the conventional playpen which allowed me to get things done around the house and this always worked out well. When I was looking for something similiar, all I could find was the pack and play...more or less just for napping or staying over nana's house..This is not what I wanted..To my surprise as I was on my computer I saw this playard and the picture caught my eye. I read on and after seeing the dimensions, I ordered it and am very happy with it..Not only is it roomy enough to let him play but it also is a great little place to nap...Nana's out there...............Go for it!!!!!"
140612,1,"This works great, and it's only sunblock I've found that doesn't cause an allergic reaction or chemical sensitivity. If you apply a heavy layer it can cast a purplish glow. Run hot tap water over it if you find it hard to apply."
30308,2,Picture does not reflect the real appearance of this prodict - you'll just get a piece of wood that is not even coated! Estimated manufacturing cost below 1 USD - don't by this - I will return it today.
167373,2,"After reading all the rave reviews, I was so thrilled to finally be able to install this once my son outgrew his Graco Snugride. I HATE it. I just can't seem to be able to get the straps adjusted correctly and the one strap is twisted after like 3 uses! And I can't seem to untwist it... it somehow got twisted behind the seat. Also, it won't adjust properly and I can't tighten the straps like I want. Now I have to take this stupid behemoth of a car seat out of my car and bring it in the house and turn it upside down and fix the flippin strap and see what is going on with the adjusting strap. Even when it was working, it seemed like the fit wasn't right for my 9mo old 21lb son. I just don't feel he is safe in the seat. Not what I want out of an almost $300 car seat.I am NOT happy. This seat sucks."
19510,1,"This is the most adorable little table and chairs. My two and four year old just absolutely love it. The hearts really make it so beautiful and appealing to them. The price was awesome. The assembly was extremely easy. I was trying to wait for my husband to put it together, but decided to give it a try myself and was glad I did. So so easy! Beautiful, sturdy, storage bins, great price,what else can I say - this was a great buy! We use it for arts and crafts, tea parties...you name it."
85504,1,"The material looks different from the image, its got more of that Snuggles teddy bear kinda look and feel. The padding is thick, which is okay for me... besides, I wouldn't consider it to be padded if it weren't as thick as it is. Whenever my 7 week old had to go in the stroller he would cry, unless he was asleep already (stroller material isn't exactly baby soft). Since we bought the insert, he falls right to sleep once laid inside.Pros:1) Its plushy; so, he will certainly be warm on cooler days and during the winter.2) Its padded, which keeps him comfy and fuss-free the entire timeCons:2) The material is probably too warm for the hotter daysOverall, even on those hotter days, my infant much prefers laying on the comfy padding of the insert than on the stroller alone. But I give it **** Stars anyway because you do have to be cautious on those hot days."
16351,1,"Don't know why this is baby-specific, but it's a great product. No worries about wet grass, you can camp out anywhere with this -- very easy to clean off, and the strap for easy carrying is great too. Wish it was a tiny bit thinner to fold up, but so glad I bought it -- will get lots of use!"
127583,1,"After a lot of research my husband & I decided to get this crib. It arrived in just two days and in great condition. My husband put it together in about an hour or so and had no problems with the pieces or instructions. The white is a nice matte white, which is great Bc we didn't want anything glossy or shiny. It's good quality and very stable. It's in our new nursery waiting for our little one to be complete :)"
127695,1,"This high chair cover is simple, fits most high chairs and easy to put on. It comes with a velcro bag for easy packing and folds nicely into it. I have used it several times, it's great and you can't beat the price!"
10750,1,"I had bought the advent bottles and my daughter always seemed to be struggling with the amount of milk that came out, especially when she was very young. The milk was always running down her chin and she gulped it. I had the medela pump in style and these bottles but never used it because I preferred the Advent manual pump...until I returned to work. Once I started using the medela electric pump I tried the bottles and found that the nipples were great. She no longer had as much gas and seemed to be able to manage the milk flow much better...sucked more like she did when she nursed. Guess the key is to only buy a few types of any bottle and give them all a try. If you read the mixed reviews, you realize all babies are different!"
52905,2,"I got both this and the Ocean Wonders Bouncer so I really have something to compare this to.Everytime I put my baby in this he cried, the vibration compared to the OW bouncer is so light he could hardly feel it.The seat does not move -- so you can't 'bounce' the baby to soothe himThe music is VERY low it can hardly be heard and there is no volume.The blanket LOOKS great but if you have a kicker like I do it is worthless -- the little tiny velcros won't hold it.Boy does that rabit on it look cute --but it will be lost or put away the first week.One thing I do LIKE about it is it turns off after it has been on for awhile so you don't ruin batteries if you pick up the baby and forget to turn it off."
46483,1,"it was exactly what it said it was, and it was a very good product"
41710,2,"Our monitor worked for only three weeks! Unfortunately we threw the box and receipt out so we couldn't return it. The first week we used it we were picking up random people on telephones and their conversations. Then we got it to work better (a bit clearer) for a week or two, and then after that it was very staticky until it finally just burnt out. The only positive feature was the glow light that turned off after 10 minutes or so on the main receiver that we kept in the baby's room. Otherwise - stay clear of this product unless you want a neat night light."
3015,1,"When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare!Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again.When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked like a charm! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better!I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights!I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep!"
22424,1,"This was great as a first bed for our little girl. We did not want a crib with bars because that's basically just putting your kid in jail and that just sucks. This was awesome for her until she was about 1 she outgrew it, but now we are going to use it for her baby sister! I will note that we had to modify the bedding so it wasn't so hard and uncomfortable, as for the first 4 months, she slept in our bed with us, and was not going to switch to an uncomfortable bed. Some battoning and foam and some water proof lining made it comfortable and safe for her, and until she outgrew them, we had her in chalks as well so she wouldn't roll around. Safety is the 1st concern, and we never had to worry about something going wrong with this, as it is all one piece and has no place for her to get injured, it's just mesh siding that she can see through."
38846,1,"We bathed our baby girl in the sink the first two months of her life and this was a MUST. it is soft, easy to store, and if you bathe you baby at night, will be dry in the morning. Plus, it was pretty handy when we started giving her a *big girl bath* in her Eurobath, we used this till we felt she was big enough.It is worth the money! BUY THIS!"
34959,2,We have a Full Size F-350 Super Duty Ford Crew Cab. You can't get a bigger back seat but you still have to push the passenger seat up quite far. We have a TrailBlazer and purchased a different seat for that vehicle because the passenger can barely fit in the seat with this car seat in the back. The leveling is a terrible design also.
166296,2,"This baby dry diaper is supposed to be used for longer duration at nights. Out of the 5 diapers I have used, the gel balls from 2 of them burst and spread all over the house. I have been using the pampers swaddlers and the pampers cruisers but never had issues with them. I will never buy the pampers "" baby dry"" diapers again."
115042,2,This is the worst pump you could buy. I have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down. It also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while I am at work. PLEASE don't waste your money....... I also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product. If you don't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing. I recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the LOUDEST pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product.
82369,0,"Considering how horrible the selection is these days for choosing a quality baby monitor that doesn't transmit to anyone and everyone who may be listening in, intentionally or unintentionally, this seems to be one of the best choices to make. Your scrambled voice will sound like Donald Duck on a regular analog 46-49 mhz cordless phone or radio scanner, so it's at least a moderate roadblock for the average signal interceptor. However, why on earth there is no 900 mhz (or higher) digital-spread-spectrum baby monitor on the market is beyond me. So, this unit is one of the better compromises out there, and at ... on amazon.com, it is amazingly affordable."
137797,0,Why is it so expensive just bcoz too much in demandShud have been a liltle cheaper to have reallyValue for money
146110,0,"I ordered this and paid for two day shipping because I was in dire need of an entertainer for my very active 4 month old. I was literally waiting by the front door for this product because I was so excited to try it out. When I took it out of the box I checked to see if I had all the parts and realized I was missing a part of the base. I figured, oh well.. I will try to put it together and see if it works without the part.. That definitely did not work because the jumper couldn't hold him up without it.. I decided to call fisher price and ask them to send the part.. They told me it would take up to 14 DAYS!! I got kind of upset because I really wanted to product soon so she said she would try to rush it.. Well, it has been 11 days and still no part so I did ""online chat"" with a representative named ""Jane"" and she didn't care that I had paid for 2 day shipping and was STILL waiting for my part.. She said it would arrive soon and didn't help at all.. I would not recommend Fisher Price to anyone because of this.. Very frustrating.."
143486,1,"I realize that I can't protect my child from much of the chemicals that he will come in contact with but at least I can control what soap goes on his skin! This product (and all Earth Mama Angel Baby products) has a wonderful safety rating from the ewg.com/skindeep database with its zero toxins. It smells great, has a rich lather and rinses clean! It seems pricey but it really does go a long way. Just make sure that you buy the small size with the pump also since it produces a foam when used. I will continue to buy this product!"
114071,1,"I have purchased several booster style high chairs and love this one the most. Whoever designed this highchair knows moms and knows babies!!!! Everything about it is great. It actually has 3 components to the tray/eating area. There is the base tray which can be used on it's own. Then there is the cover for the tray. This cover is exactly like the tray but removeable. It too can be eaten off of, but having it there allows you to remove it, throw it in the dishwasher, clean it etc. all while baby can sit there and enjoy more food or a safe place to sit while you do this. This may sound silly or un-needed but I have two kids under two and I frequently babysit my 2 year old niece. Trust me, it's a life saver!!!! Also......if your fickle and easily distracted eater decides to take a break with eating to go play you can cover the tray of food and leave it there or even throw it in the fridge!!! Like I said - GENIUS!!!!!!!!!There is nothing I don't love. I also own the Peg Perego Primma Pappa which I also love. But given the bulk and price tag ($200+) overall I rate this one the best!!!!!!!"
98393,1,This tub is perfect! I was scared to try the plastic ones for fear of him falling (he just started sitting up) and the inflatables looked too time consuming. We love the beads in this one because they are soft and dry quickly. Our son loves picking at the material and tries to grab the designs while taking a bath. The tub must be at least half full for this one to work. I would recommend this product to my family and friends. Thanks Leachco!
171612,1,"I LOVE this tub. The net is awesome for preemies. My son was born at 3 lb. 7 oz. I used this tub with him after he left the hospital at 4 lb. 6.oz. The net made he and I both feel more secure secure, His first bath at home was overall more enjoyable and stress-free for both of us because of it."
159828,1,"I have the blue version of this bouncer and have used it from the first day we brought our son home. He is 5 1/2 months old and still loves bounding in it and reaching for the toys that hang from the toy bar. I don't want it to ""babysit"" him, but if I did, he could sit in it and play for hours at a time. Plus, if he is ever cranky, we can put him it without the toy bar and turn on the vibrations which soothe him nicley. It was a great place for him between 0-3 months when he took lots of short naps during the day. This is probably the one item I absolutlely needed to get by (excluding necessities like diapers and a carseat)."
70429,0,"This seat serves its purpose, however I'd recommend buying another one. I bought it for the 4 in 1 benefit, however, it is difficult to get it stable in the car because of my minivan seat. A rolled towel helps, but doesn't always keep it in place."
152190,1,"Since my grandson is only 9 months old, I was really worried that he wouldn't be able to drink from this straw cup, even though he's been using straws for more than a month. When I got it I washed it out and filled it with apple juice and gave it to him and... no problem. He drank with no hesitation or problem at all.The cup is not 100% spill proof, but about 90%, much better than a regular cup with straw. He had a little trouble finding the straw the first two or three sips, he kept going for the red cap closer instead; but he got it pretty quick.I only wish it had a rounded bottom and was bottom heavy so that it would stay right side up. It's hard for him to put it down correctly and have it stand up. If the shape where designed to force it to return to the right side up, I'd have given it five stars."
140447,0,"This swing is the only one I could find that had the plug-in option, obviously better for the pocketbook and environment than a battery eater. However, the seat is pitched back so far that my 4 month old always cranes his neck to look around and looks uncomfortable. Fisher Price could add months of usefullness to this product by just adding another tilt option so babies who want to sit up can. I have had it for a month and a half and wish I could justify the price and size it's taking up in my apt. Should have bought it earlier!"
19975,0,"I like the bowls, but I only gave them 3 stars because the big appeal is that they are supposed to suction to the tray or table. They stick to the surface for just a few seconds and then release the suction. They are still nice bowls with lids, just do not expect them to stick. If you don't need lids, save some money and get the five pack of bowls without suction cups."
122858,0,"I think this is a wonderful idea. However, it did not work for us. My son was somehow still able to wiggle his arm free, although I had followed all the directions and was using it properly. Maybe he is too big for it. I purchased the beige one. I guess I was expecting the fabric to be stretchier than it was. It felt like linen or canvas to me. It would probably be great for babies who don't move too much yet, maybe under 3months old."
173442,1,"Right from the start our son was most comforted by motion. He also liked to be held tightly for the first couple weeks but now likes having room to move. The Papasan seems to give him the feeling of being cradled safely on all sides while being moved around, yet he can kick up and out when he wants to and isn't too limited in his movements. Sometimes when he's particularly bored and I can't carry him anymore just being able to switch from front-to-back rocking to side-to-side rocking is enough to keep him happy. So in the end he seems to feel like he's being held and rocked by one of us when he's in the swing, but he stays cool since the Swing doesn't generate body heat.I wish the music and mobile motion lasted longer, but at least it's easy to reset with just the push of a button. I haven't noticed much of a difference in the various speeds, they all seem fast and our son liked it from the start.All in all, the Swing has been invaluable. It's been so helpful, my mom bought one just for when we come to visit!"
102518,0,"My 3 month old son loves this Mobile, but mechanically it leaves a lot to be desired. The leaves often get jammed in the down position which stops the animals from circling. I had to rig the leaves so that they stay in the up position. This allows the animals to circle freely. It stays on for about 15 minutes which is just right for us. The volume is really low, but since it's so close to the baby's head, I think this is a good thing. I recommend it because I searched high and low for a bright rainforest mobile and this was, by far, the most attractive option. And, again, my son really likes it."
27942,0,"I purchased this seat when my son was about 4 months old. I did look at the responses on here as well as other sites to decide on this seat over the Bumbo Seat. He loved to sit in it and felt secure in it. It was nice to take to restaurants and use in the booth next to me. We did this before he could sit up on his own and would not be able to use the booster seats or highchairs most places have. It was also much easier to have at the table than the entire stroller. The chair does look like it is hard plastic, but as others have said, it is softer than it appears! Very easy to wipe off and clean. My only problem with this was the pummel came off. It actually tore off! I had my son in it and he was super wiggly and pushed on the pummel and it tore right off! Well, with out this piece, your child will not stay in the chair. I don't think it can be glued back together since it seat is made of foam. But it was VERY useful before it broke! I would have used this product again for baby #2, but since it broke, I will not be buying a replacement unless I can get one secondhand."
117415,1,"the totseat arrived in a timely manner and the product itself is wonderful. my daughter is 14 months old and she fits in it nicely. there's certainly room for growth, for at least another year or so. if you need baby to reach a table, it might be beneficial to secure a booster seat underneath, but it's not something you should do without supervision. i'm eager to use this for travel to italy this summer, where it's hard to fit anything bulky in the suitcases."
24617,1,"Bought this gate three months ago to help keep my puppy safe in the kitchen while we are gone during the day. It has worked like a charm! No more wooden busted up gates to lift each time or climb over! OUr puppy was actually climbing the wooden gates by placing her paws inbetween the fencing! Not only could she have gotten hurt, but think about this . . . if she can fit her paws in there then surely a toddler could figure that out too! The HandsFreeGate eliminates the worry your child may climb it. They can't on this gate! All of my friends will get this gate at their baby showers!"
1509,1,"So upset with Amazon. I tried to request this shipment sooner, however, website wouldn't accept it. I tried it a few times and it wouldn't accept it. Then I come home a couple of days later with 3 of these boxes on my porch! Why do I need 666 size 3 diapers at one time with one child?!"
29651,2,"We have twin boys, premature...and I have searched high and low for chlorine free diapers. NO ONE has any chlorine free newborn diapers. As an infant, you would think that is the most important time to have chlorine free diapers, but not a single online vendor or retail store carries them...unless we go to cloth, which is not feasible with preemie twins. Online vendors need to wake up to the fact that babies are not born at 14 pounds..."
56257,0,"Ours seems to work ok. It doesn't get great reception on our living room but it's workable. I can see what she's doing from the couch while I watch my shows. The static noice doesn't seem that load to me. the volumn does not seem bad to me unless you turm up the volumn really load. I even run a fan in the babies room and still not much static. I would recommend buying this from Walmart or Babies r us and saving your reciept in case it doesn't work for you. It's hard to return things you've bpught online and TARGET is really strict about thier return policy. Do not buy any baby gear there. I'm serious. Walmart, Kmart and Babies r Us will take things back, no questions asked if you have a reciept and will ussuallt replace or give store credit without a reciept."
46358,2,"I ordered this item on Amazon for my little Maltese. We had already purchased the Superyard XT, but we wanted something similar but with a gate so our Maltese can go in and out freely when he pleases especially for bathroom purposes. We ordered the Summer Infant Secure Surround Safe Play with extension thinking it would be just like the Superyard XT (also with extension) but with a gate.The Summer Infant Secure Surround wasn't as sturdy as the Superyard XT and the gate was hard to open (we made our pen into a square). Sure enough, that night while our dog was jumping on the flimsy pen wall the two wall panels somehow bent inward and caught my dog's leg. This never happened with the Superyard XT. I was really upset that that had happened so I definitely don't recommend this product for an infant or a dog.I'm so glad that Amazon made the return process so easy, otherwise I would be even more upset if I couldn't return this item."
41862,2,THIS PRODUCT SO THIN AND FLAT. IT WAS NOT DURABLE AT ALL AND COULD BE EASILY TORN WITH THE SLIGHTEST USE IN FACT ONE OF THE MATTRESSES ARRIVED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A FINGER PRINT TEAR.
42034,1,"This is such a wonderful stroller! With 2 children, this is the 5th stroller I have purchased. It is hands down the best one I've ever owned. I love the versitality of facing forward or backwards. Its also stylish and much more affordable than the Bugaboo, for similar look. My daughter loves sitting up high and being able to look at me when we go for walks.Can't go wrong with this!!"
59877,1,I bought this tub after reading all the positive reviews. I have been bathing my baby in it since she was 4 weeks old. She loves the water and this tub allows her to kick and splash while safely keeping her head out of the water. The other end of the tub will be used when she is able to sit on her own. The con about this tub is it is large but I have found that it fits nicely under the baby's crib and is obscured by the crib skirt.
154596,0,"It is an ok wipe, but not as thick and not as big as Earth's Best. I bought 7th Generation wipes because Amazon is out of stock with the Earth's Best wipes, plus the price hike. I'm still on a mission to find the best natural wipes. So far, Earth's best is winning by a mile amongst 7th generation and others."
78945,1,I will be puttinf this product to the test in 2 days. SO far it appears that it will be abreeze. Your carseat MUST have the latch system in order to use this.
66671,1,"We originally had a graco travel system, which we also like, but I do so much walking, sometimes up to 5 miles a day and we needed something a little more durable. This stroller is so comfortable and easy to use. it is big, so if thats a problem for you then you probably don't want a jogging stroller. It folds down nicely though. still a little big but no big deal. Great stroller and I love the built in raincover in the hood."
123046,1,"My son was 2 and a half when my mom got this for us, he would NOT sit down to do any of his stuff on ANYTHING! This potty drew his attention from the time he laid eyes (and ears) on it he just sat on it and for about 4 months would not even pee standing! I think he liked the fact that it's a special ""kid"" thing, fun, unlike the plain potties I had for him.. I guess the negative reviews are all by parents of really small children. I think it would too complicated and distracting for a 1 yr old, or - you really have to see your child's capabilities of handling multiple voices and lights and music (you can turn them off, but then why buy a potty with all that stuff?). The only thing I dont like is the splash guard falling off, but it still gets 5 stars because it's entertaining, it looks so cool with it's white green and blue and most importantly - it did just what it was made to do - got a stubborn and picky toddler to behave a little more like a human being!"
149139,1,"I absolutely love this pillow, but I think my husband loves it even more because I'm no longer tossing and turning all night. Plus I don't have to get up and go to the bathroom as much since I'm not waking up a dozen times trying to get comfortable. There is a bad review due the seam, but I didn't even notice it. Not sure if the pillow has changed since then, but it's certainly not a problem for me.Why I love this pillow:1. Slept many nights all the way through without waking up (but some nights duty still calls)2. No more tossing and turning3. No more cramping in my back and belly when sleeping on my side4. No more snoring - As a prego you are suppossed to sleep on your side but this was very uncomfortable for me. I'd always seem to end up on my back and then I'd start sawing logs, which leads me to the next one.5. My husband is happy because I'm no longer waking him up6. Great for propping yourself up for reading or watching tvThe cons:1. I ordered a red pillow, but they sent me a white one. Not really anything faulty with the design, but just a mix up.2. I haven't had to wash it yet, but I can tell it's going to be a bit of a struggle to get the slip cover back on after cleaning.Overall, I just know that I'm sleeping better and so is my husband and that to me is worth 5 stars."
91454,2,"This is a horribly annoying monitor. It has an amazing amount of static. The only way to hear my child is to turn the volume high and only then I might be able hear her through the static interference. The red lights are always illuminated, no matter if my child is talking or not, so clearly they are not doing their job either. My 8 year old Graco works much better."
138876,1,"We bought this turtle to help my son start sleeping with the light off, well it absolutely worked!! i cannot say enough good things about this product!!!!!!! i would give it 10 stars if i could! The minute we got it he was asking to go to bed with the light off! The colors of the stars it displays are beautiful! And amazon delivered this incredibly fast! I am a very happy customer1"
60802,1,I bought this product based on reviews and I am glad I did. I can tell that there is no smell! And I empty it every 2 days. It's so easy! No dirty diapers' smell in your house. And I don't mind buying the refills if it means keep the house odor free.
139294,1,"This is a great item. Great for older babies, about 9 months and up. The only problem I have with it, is that the plush fur gets caught on the battery contacts, and the item won't work. Just be sure to move the fur before you go thru the trouble of screwing the battery door down. Don't let your child sleep with it- my son used it as a step, and the battery door broke because of this. Other than that, he loves the stars."
169506,1,"This bag is very comfortable to wear, and the size and location of the zippered pockets in the front, the snap-closure pocket on the back, and the pockets in the larger main compartment makes it easy to keep things organized and easy to find. We've only been using the bag for a few weeks, so I can't speak to its durability, but the construction appears solid, and the zippers work easily.The only negatives are the smallish mobile phone holder (won't hold anything much bigger than a standard flip phone), and the fact that the interior is lined in black, which makes it harder to see items in the bag. (Many baby bag manufacturers have moved to a light-colored interior lining for this reason. It makes it much easier to see what's in the bottom of your bag.) These are relatively minor issues, though, and overall the bag is very well designed and convenient to use. It's very helpful that everything is accessible without having to take the bag off or set it down (unlike a backpack-style diaper bag, for example).This bag is definitely on the small side for a diaper bag, though. We have two kids, 1 and 4 years old, and this bag is good for a trip to the park for a couple of hours or something like that, but too small for our family to use to take the kids to grandpa's house for a whole day. If you want a bag that's small and comfortable to wear for shorter trips, though, this is a good choice."

54995,1,"We just got this seat, we set it up and our child has been on it three times so far and she doesn't even have to go. She loves it, she thinks it's fun to potty on the ducky seat. It fits the toilet well and it's easy to keep clean. Great product and worth the money."
142577,0,"I inherited this breastfeeding pillow and I both love it and hate it.PROs:-The pillow stays put. I've tried a Boppy and while it's easy to put on, it tends to move around a lot. This was really helpful when getting my baby to latch properly when he was first born (I had to try so many different positions and this pillow was wonderful at it!).-The pillow is WIDE, which can be both a pro and a con. I love how wide it is now that my son is 3.5 months old--he still fits comfortably on it! I used my friend's Boppy a week ago and noticed my son did not fit as comfortably on it.CONs:-I HATE the velcro closure. It is so LOUD it often wakes my sleeping baby.-The pillow is WIDE so I often have to nurse my son sitting at the edge of my glider, which is not the most comfortable for me. It's better to use this pillow on a sofa or bed.-It's hard to use--I need two hands to put it on, although I'm getting a lot better at putting it on with one hand now (yes, it only took me 3.5 months to get used to that!). Now I have a system where I put it on and then pick my baby up from his crib to nurse him.-The cloth cover is horrible. It is so faded from just a few washings...it doesn't stand up like the Boppy fabric does (I've only used the Boppy Luxe--not sure about other Boppy fabrics)."
64633,1,"We have this in red and just love it - it's perfect for keeping in the car, bottom of the stroller, or taking with you on the go when you don't want to carry the entire diaper bag. A great find!"
128497,1,"So happy to find bottles in glass. Could not find them anywhere. It's nice to not worry about plastic byproduct seeping into the milk. These worked great. Clean easily, haven't broken any yet. Shipping was a little spendy so I'm glad I bought some for me and some friends who are having babies. Made it more reasonable."
79115,1,"I love these things. They go up so easy, look great and if you make a mistake just take them off and they restick with no problem."
67195,1,"I enjoy this stool overall. The adjustability is handy, and the color is nicely done--but the little grip things on the bottom would not stay stuck to the feet =/ I ended up using a staple gun and tacking them in place after then had fallen off a half dozen times, and even then one of them ripped off. Still functional though, and gets the job done."
63609,2,Head support was not that good. I had to put something else there to help support my grandson's head.
5434,1,"I can't believe my car is as neat as it is, and amazed at how much I can stuff into the XL litterbag. It's great. The only annoyance I have with it ist hat the bag does not expand to full size. Instead, it contracts until it's stuffed. Not a big deal, but I find it a little annoying. Great otherwise!"
162643,2,"I used this tub for my second child. It leaked every time. We had to up towels all around it when we used it. It has no suction cups or anything to keep the tub itself on the counter. I found I could only wash her with one hand because the other hand had to be on the tub to make sure it didn't slip away! Plus, it was hard to wash her bum, and her legs from the knee down and feet were never in the water. (The &quot;pad&quot; isn't soft, just helps baby from slipping down.) It is light weight, and does fold, but for baby #3 (due in April 2002) we are shopping for a different tub!!"
13051,1,"Not to dispute the car seat technician's points, but as parents who need to move the car seat from car to car, my husband and I wouldn't travel without this little wonder. Sure a car seat inspector can tell you if your seat is installed correctly when they see it, but what about after I've taken the seat out and put it in another car...? I'm not going back every time I move the seat! This is one of the best baby safety products I've found and I love it!"
35478,1,the floppy seat is the coolest thing ever because my son sits in dirty highchairs and shopping carts and now he sits on the floppy seat witch makes it soft and alot of times hwe will fall asleep in it!! (witch he never would do without it!) thankyou who ever invented this !!BUY IT TODAY!!
114719,1,"I bought this seat for a friend and they have absolutely loved it! It goes everywhere and is highly adaptable to restaurant seats, various kitchen chairs as well as tailgating (chair-in-a-bag). It folds up nicely and is not a space hog. Being dishwasher safe has also been a plus I'm told!"
68891,1,"I've used these diapers for my two daughters for the last 3+ years. I've tried other brands, but just keep coming back to the Swaddlers/Cruisers brand. The elasticity and the baby fresh smell just get me every time.But what used to be a good deal at Amazon is now comparable in price to anywhere else I can get them -- Target or Babies R Us. So to me, there's no incentive to shop at Amazon anymore."
4162,1,"We just took our first vacation with our daughter and what with everything we needed to pack for the week and check through or take with us on the plane, this bag was exactly what we needed to get most of what our daughter needed onto the plane and then once landed back onto the back of her stroller. We were dubious at first about how worthwhile the bag might be but decided to purchase it anyway. It's safe to say in retrospect we used this bag as much as if not more than anything else we bought in preparation for the trip. Great bag. Super roomy and organized and easy to find whatever you need inside it."
153478,2,"After bringing up 4 kids, and trying out a lot of different brands of diapers, I think this is the only one which I strongly feel will not buy again.it leaks, and the velcro is too tiny , and keepc coming off."
179230,2,"Like many other reviewers experienced, the first time our baby tryed these bottles, she sucked for 10 minutes and didn't get anything. We went back and looked at the instructions and found that you're supposed to massage the nipple, and the disc at the bottom of the bottle to make sure that both the nipple hole and vents in the disc are open and working... which they weren't straight out of the package. After that, she hasn't had any trouble getting milk from the bottles. Now the problem is that the shape of the nipple hole (kind of like a 3 pronged star) makes them very prone to tearing. So we've already had to throw away at least 7 nipples in the 4 weeks she's been regularly bottle-feeding, and that's only during the day when she's at daycare. I'll be switching to new bottles once we run out of nipples (won't be long at this rate!!), since that will certainly be cheaper in the long run than having to keep buying replacement nipples."
26479,0,"We received this as a gift and we love it. It's true - the music isn't the symphony - but what baby toy is. It's also true that this does not rock on it's own, which I thought was the case - but if your baby is crying you usually hold them to comfort them anyway. But aside from those 2 things this bassinet is great and looks great. We are able to roll our baby around the house while he's sleeping and never disturb him, and my husband & I switch who's side of the bed we put it on each night. Our baby is 4 months now and we hate the idea of leave him in another room away from us."
63398,0,My husband had a hard time filling this with water. You really have to squeeze the whole and even then it takes a while. Our daughter is 12 months but hates belly time so I thought we would try this. It is a good idea but does not keep her interest.
50857,1,"I have horrible back pain even when I'm not pregnant. The chiropracter recommeded sleeping with a pillow between my legs, but it always felt awkward. When I was pregnant the first time my back pain was 10x's worse. I didn't really think these maternity pillows would work and I didn't want to spend the money on a bum product.Now that I'm pregnant again I don't want to suffer through the back pain. There were times when it would take me 15 minutes to get out of bed, the first time I was pregnant. I decided to get a maternity pillow this time because the back pain was already starting in the first trimester.After seeing how highly rated this product was I decided that it would be the best one to get. I also got a 20% Amazon Mom coupon that this item qualified for. This really does help align my back so that the pain isn't as bad.It comes with a sheet that shows additional ways to use it during pregnancy and after. I like my head to be propped up and I usually use three pillows to achieve that when I'm sleeping. I don't have to use that anymore. Plus that always gave me a crick in my neck and this way doesn't anymore.It's not that bukly in bed. What I do is I put it on the outside so that I can either face it or have my back to it. It doesn't push my husband out of the bed so that works out for him. He never has to deal with it.The bonus of this pillow is that my 2 1/2 year old son loves it. You can do a swirl position with it (the card you get with it shows you) and I put my son in the middle. It's like a pillow bean bag chair for him. He likes it so much he falls asleep in it. I wouldn't recommend a smaller child and there is a warning label that says not for younger children.I wish I had this pillow with my first pregnancy, but I'm glad I have it for my 2nd."
104414,1,I have a very tricky 18month old who likes to stack things outside gates to make an escape - this gate has thwarted his attempts! It's a GREAT height where he can't try to open it. Total peace of mind! Really solid construction and super easy to install (although I didn't use the wall discs - those are a pain). Highly recommend!!
55828,1,I had to replace it once after 3 months since it stopped working. Hence 4 stars. But amazon replacement process was a breeze.We have been using it since the day it arrived and it was very difficult to be without it for less than a week while we waited for the replacement to arrive.
25474,2,these liners are waaaaay too rough in comparison to others on the market. i won't even use them. buy a different brand!
150386,0,"My 2 year old drinks a lot and we have leaks every night. The overnites seem to hold more than other diapers but I still can't get through a single night without changing clothes, sheets and mattress pad. I tried different sizes in case one size was to big or small."
170112,1,"it scratches easily so make sure you're careful when transporting the package to the assembly area. Also, make sure you use padding where you assemble this product.Getting some help putting this together is A MUST as you'll have to lift and screw some of the parts at the same time. Otherwise, wonderful little crib, normal size mattress fits perfect, even has some space below for storage (if you have the flat storage boxes or plastic bins).Very happy with this purchase, and saved $60 over buying it at my local Babies R Us or Target."
111761,1,"I bought this gate about 6 months ago when my little one started to creep. I thought the installation was so simple, I think it took me a total of 30 minutes (if that). I installed it at the top of 2 stairs in the foyer to our kitchen. I was even creative enough to stain it to match the rest of the wood work in my kitchen! I get a lot of compliments on how great it looks! I highly recommend this one! It's a keeper!"
65787,0,"I bought these because I was tired of washing the bottles that connect to my pump, and I thought that these would be an easier, albeit more wasteful, alternative.Overall, I'm not a huge fan. I use them mainly to store milk in the freezer after I've pumped it into a bottle, which defeats my main purpose in buying them.When pumping directly into the bags, the milk gets all over the zipper, which is hard enough to seal when it is clean. The instructions say to make sure there is no milk in the zipper before freezing, as it can cause leakage once the milk freezes and expands. It is virtually impossible to clean the milk out of the zipper if you pump directly into the bag.Another flaw that I see in the bags is the accuracy of the volume measurements. Since it is a bag, the volume depends on how open it is, this is just the nature of a bag, but it is annoying when you think you have 5 ounces, and the bottle reads three and a half. This leads to an angry baby.I have not had any bags leak so far, but I have found that it can be tricky pouring the milk from the bag to the bottle without spillage.I will most likely not buy these bags again."
95963,0,"This pillow is huge - even in a king size bed. While it can be very confortable, I didn't like it - particularly because (1) I wanted to use my own pillow under my head - which means I'm laying on outside of hudge pillow; and (2) when pregnant and needing to go to bathroom every couple hours, I felt like I had to wrestle or leapfrog a barrier to get out of bed each time. I found I preferred the below pillow - although it is not perfect either (since it is smaller and doesn't necessarily stay in good position all night).http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0022B1DZG/ref=oss_product"
9556,1,"It is one of the most stable, comfortable and ""consistant"" seat I have found. My 18 month old daughter can get on and off by her self and hits the target every time. The hole is larger than any other I've seen."
149686,2,"This was cute and my daughter loved it at first. But, The legs started breaking after a few months and always needed pushed back together. The whole thing broke after several months or maybe a year."
117938,2,these break real easy. they have a single point of stress on the plastic. I'd never buy another. Instead I recommend the mommyhook. it's so much better for 2 reasons: 1. it's metal & doesn't break. 2. it closes so it's not an open hook that things can fall off of and (here's a third - just thought of it) - it's much bigger than these plastic things & bags don't fall off.
63274,0,We have been extremely satisfied with this car seat. We wanted something for my husbands car as a back up for when I'm not home. It is very nice and padded sufficiently. I didn't rate it higher because the arm rests are flimsy and tend to get knocked off when I pull my son out of the seat. The other issue is the 5 point harness it a bit tricky to get tightened.
165703,1,"I've used pampers for 4 kids over a 20 year span. They're still a favorite. They smell better than some brands (smell like a baby) and dont leave those little white beads on baby's bottom like another name brand. Only problem is once in a while when putting one one, a tab pulls off, but that is rare."
13099,2,"I have heard from Safety Techs that this product gives an unfounded feeling of security to parents, and, even when used according to its directions, can allow the seat to be dangerously loose in a crash. It can even damage the seat belt. Please get your seat checked professionally and learn how to install it right. This 'helper' isn't the kind you need."
177615,1,When i was in the hospital i was so stressed on trying to get my baby to breast feed. He didn't want to except my nipple. When i gave him a pacifier he seemed to be fine. He sucked on the pacifier very well. I got the isis breast pump as a gift so when i left the hospital and got home i tried pumping milk and giving it to him through a bottle. the pump is so accurate and gentle i can pump milk every two hours to feed my son so he can still get what he needs from breast milk and be confortable eating from a botttle
50523,1,This pillow is a wonderful invention for a pregnant woman. I used it for both of my pregnancies and now buy them for my friends who become pregnant. They all love it too! The only negative to it is that it takes up a lot of room in the bed and our husbands usually don't like that. At least mine didn't. I also used this pillow after the baby was born while recovering from my c-section and it was great!
132466,1,I have not used it yet but did a trial run with only one wipe and it warmed the top of the wipe. I guess its just suppose to warm only the top wipe to decrease drying out the rest.
91655,1,This playmat was awesome for my daugter up until she could turn over. Once she was able to do that she always hit her head on the birdy. ( the swaying birdy would accually hit her). if there were a way to unatach the birdy and the stem it comes off of it would be great. the toys that hang from the bars can keep my daughter buys for hours. the toys that come with it do come off and you can add your babys favorite toys from there. so much fun...
121570,0,"Wasn't really expecting much, just wanted a cheap system for our bedroom. It fills up quickly, and our regular garbage bags are too big for the pail. We just fill it up in our bedroom and dump the diapers into the big kitchen garbage, and start all over again until the reused bag in our bedroom starts to stink (fine for at least 4 loads). It's fine for our needs, we don't notice nasty smells lingering like I expected, so pretty happy with it overall."
16396,1,"this picnic blanket was really good for a flat surface, however the event i purchased it for was for a concert with a grassy hill, and i slipped right off the top. i had to have my feet on the grass with my body on the blanket and it was a bit annoying, couldn't stand on it for the same reason."
76975,1,"When this swing arrived and we set it up, we found that the mobile and lights did not work. I called Fisher-Price and they immediatly sent out a new motor. In the meantime we were still able to use the swing. The new motor works very well. My baby loves to go side to side and the lights really hold her attention. Sometimes she falls asleep in the swing, but most of the time she watches the lights. Also, the fact that the swing plugs in is a big benefit. I am so glad I splurged and bought this swing. The colors will easily work for a boy or girl and Fisher-Price has stood behind their product."
162602,2,"If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you... except that you'll only use it for 3 months because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space. As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that. And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at. Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)"
803,1,"We tried Pampers Baby Dry, Cruisers, Huggies and Target branded diapers before. Pampers Baby Dry is the best. Very soft and does not have a strange smell. The most important thing is that it does not cause rashes. Highly recommend this product."
92830,1,"I think this product is great.. I bought it for my son who was 3 1/2 months old at the time.. The pediatrician said he needed to do tummy time 4x a day.. He hated tummy time so I got him this in hopes he would change his outlook on it.. He has, he is almost 5 months now and he love it, he plays with the toys on each petal.. Once he's tired of one he spins himself to the next.. Also to make this item even better, it is so compact.. You take it out to play with it than you can fold the mat up and take the tummy device and put it under his bed or in the closet or where ever.. It can go anywhere you go because its so easy to maneuver.. I would recommend this to everyone.."
32981,1,"I took this and my new Triumph Convertible carseat to the police station to have it installed properly and the policeman was still unable to install it correctly (without reading the directions, BTW). When I got home I read the directions and realized that all I needed to do was cut it to the size of my carseat base, and now it works like a charm! This is terrific! I also like the 3 different levels which is great if someone else has to use the seat in their car. I just wasn't comfortable with the idea of rolled towels, and a noodle would have made this (rearfacing)seat recline too much. Cutting it was really easy, by the way, I just sliced right through it with a sharp kitchen knife."
148403,1,We traded our arm chair potty seats for this simple seat after seeing how easy it was for the little ones to use and how much better they like it. It does not tip like the other larger chair type seats. You don't have to worry about pinched fingers with this little seat that often happens with the chair type when the babies try ot lift and move the chair or pull out the potty holder. It is soooo simple to dump and clean. It takes up very little space. The little ones love it and can easily move it around and sit on it without having to scootch themselves onto it and worry with opening a lid like they did with the bigger seat chairs. And its design has a built in guard for the boys!!! I would highly recommend this over any other type of seat and we have tried a number of different designs.
112288,1,"I love Pampers Cruisers. My daughter used them until she was potty trained and they were great. When my son outgrew the Swaddlers, I bought Cruisers. We went through one large box and then I tried some Huggies. Then, when I switched back to Cruisers I noticed an irritation developed on my son's stomach, at the top of the diaper. After a week, this ""irritation"" spread all over his bottom, to his back, and around his hips. It did not respond to diaper creams. His pediatrician diagnosed a yeast infection. The rash did not responed at all to the antifungal ointment that was prescribed or to the OTC antifungal that was subsequently recommended. I tried watching his diet and didn't introduce any new foods, I let him air dry when I changed his diaper, and I kept calling the nurse to see what we should do next. (I should add that my son does not seem to have sensitive skin...it has not been affected by soaps, detergents, or anything else.) After a few weeks, I realized that this rash was everywhere that the diaper touched, but not in creases, and there was even a white line where the elastics run along his butt. But everywhere else was an awful rash. I decided to switch diapers to see if the Cruisers were the problem, and within a week the rash was completely gone. This is after six or so long weeks of fighting this itchy rash. I had ruled out the Cruisers as the culprit because we had used a large box previously without incident. I'm not sure what happened, but the diapers in the new box did look a little different than the ones in the first box we used. I hope that this can help other parents to identify the cause of this rash before having their child suffer through a rash for so long. I don't think I had ever heard of a baby being allergic to diapers."
9998,1,"Excellent Toilet training seat. My daughter is able to sit on her own and the seat remains in place. We had an extra long toilet seat and this one fits like a charm. The only con is the price, it is three times more expensive than regular toilet training seats."
170256,1,"I just picked up the crib my brother put it today in under an hour it is aaawesome. All screws and bolts and crib parts were there the instructions were fairly easy to understand. The crib truly is better looking than the picture. Got it for my day care has not used it yet did not get any scratches while putting it together will be ordering three more in different colours. Love it love it love it thanks amazon,the Davinci Emily company and all those who sells this product.I highly recommend this product because it is very sturdy and great for small spaces. Another thing I always receive my items before the scheduled date no complaints here. Thanks again amazon.com"
31907,1,"Since each container holds 2.5 ozs of milk, these are perfect for when you're just starting to pump and probably don't produce very much milk. It sounds silly, but it eased my anxiety and made pumping easier when I attached one of these to my pump and was able to see it fill up than when I used one of the 5 oz Medela bottles and felt like I was barely collecting anything. The milk in these thaws fairly quickly, and it's great to know how much you've stored. As a bonus, you can use a pencil to write the date and time on the side of the bottle and it washes/wipes off well, so it's easy to use the containers again and again without getting confused."
151643,1,"I went through two bottles of this stuff during my pregnancy! I used Palmers products before I discovered this, and I felt like they weren't doing anything at all. Thankfully in my Amazon search I found this product, and have been in love ever since. I would apply it to my belly every night before I went to bed. Because it's an oil, it can stain, but I just wore an old shirt or tank top to bed that I didn't care about. The oil helped with moisturizing, cut back on itching, and [I believe] prevented any stretch marks.I think without this product I would have definitely gotten stretch marks because: 1) my mom got them when she was pregnant, 2) I have gotten a few before on my upper thighs in high school, and 3) my doctor was certain my baby would come early because he said my belly was stretched to its absolute max, and there was literally no more room (he was right, I was 2.5 weeks early with an 8lb 3oz baby!).I am giving this as a present to any of my expecting friends in the future, and I recommend it all the time. It really is an incredible product, and worth every penny!"
28150,1,Works good to separate the sizes. Should be a little more durable but they do serve the purpose. Wish they came with removeable stickers to label the sizes.
100708,1,I make sure I reorder every few monthsLove this offer and these diapers are excellentI highly recommend these diapers
120470,1,"In preparation for our first child, I spent many, many months looking for the best baby monitor on the market. I purchased the one with the hand-held video screen, but the reception was horrible, so I returned it. This monitor is the only one that got 5 stars and rightfully so. Once I decided to purchase this one, it took me about two months just to find a store that carried the monitor. I finally received it and believe that it was worth the wait. I love this monitor and would not have any other one watching over my precious son!"
127763,1,"I absolutly LOVE this bed. My 2 year old loves it too. I thought it was crazy to spend over $100 for a toddler bed that they are just going to grow out of, but this one you can get the rails and carry it on to a full size bed. Its really nice looking and doesn't look cheap at all! Its also very sturdy. The style of it too is still kind of like her crib so I think that is why the transition from her crib to this bed was so easy. I would recommend this to all of my friends shopping for a toddler bed."
45460,1,"This is a great baby gym! I got it before my son was born and couldn't wait to use it! I bought the black and white set of toys from Tiny Love and hung those in the gym when my son was a newborn. At 2 months we put him in it and he was immediately drawn to the toys. He also liked to look in the mirror which encouraged him to turn his head.At 3 months we changed the toys to the original ones and added the wind chimes by Tiny Love. The wind chimes became his favorite! The toys are all so different that my son never gets bored. We are also able to add any toys that have loops on them to give my son a neverending changing and stimulating environment!Now that my son is rolling over and starting to scoot on his tummy, he will reach and move to get to the toys at the far corners of the mat. He also loves the crinkly ear and butterfly!My only complaint is that we washed it and it faded pretty significantly. However this is not at all a reason to not purchase this toy. It is well worth the money for how versitile, stimulating, and engaging this toy is for my son!"
83297,1,"This product was very easy to use, quick clean up, and very discrete to carry in public. My husband and I are constantly using it when we are out with our child. I especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage."
160236,1,"I used this when my baby boy was a newborn. He was born in November, and the Swaddle Me was nice, and soft, and cozy. We read about the virtues of swaddling in the ""Happiest Baby on The Block"" book, while I was still pregnant. I used this from the very beginning, even in the hospital. I was able to get it on and off quickly, even for the NUMEROUS diaper changes that were required for a breastfed baby! Even my hubby was able to get our baby swaddled with this blanket! :)"
161546,1,"I got this tub as a shower gift, and now I get it for everyone I know who is having a baby. It is great. I used the sling in and out of the tub. I did like the little &quot;hooks&quot; the tub had to hold the sling in place. The first time I used the tub I did leak. I noticed that the tub was not locked all the way. After fixing that, it never leaked again. I love it and my year old son loves it. The only thing is that he loves a big tub filled with about 8 inches of water in it so he can swim and put his head under the water. When he can't do that in the baby tub he starts to get frustrated."
173842,1,"This swing buys me a couple more hours of sleep in the earlymornings when my baby wants to wake up too soon. I love the look and design and the music isn't annoying. The mirror is great as my son loves looking at his own face a lot, great buy."
18129,1,"Wonderful all around... I can't say enough good things about this product! the music is soothing and both babies just loved the sound and colors. The little extra pillow really helps with tummy time too. Great, Great, Great."
48246,0,"This is a good sun shade that is easy to put on....only complaint is that I wish it had something to attach it to the bottom of the stroller as well as the top. My child kept kicking it and pulling it in on her because it isn't attached at the bottom, it just drapes from the top."
124727,1,I absolutley love the silver color it seems to be of a very durable material and its GORGEOUSE I LOVE IT!!! I TOTALLY RECOMEND!!!
144106,1,"I have only had the chair for about a month but I am really impressed. Our 6 month old fits in the high chair attachment perfectly. It wasnt that bad to assemble, although they could have used more finger screws/wingnuts instead of regular srews that necessitate the use of a philips screwdriver. Compared to most stuff I have had to assemble (Graco swing, Million Dollar Baby crib) its MUCH easier with straightforward directions. Chair looks great in our dining room, not an eyesore like every other highchair. Very sleek and modern. Definately recommend getting the plastic tray cover--the baby food usually winds up all over it and its much easier to clean than if it was all over the wood tray. Very sturdy and WILL NOT tip over by any effort of our kid."
27170,0,"It seems like every accessory I have bought for my bugaboo Chameleon has been a bust. The cupholder can be added to the list. The suggestion to mount the holder on the outside of the handle means that it becomes a prime target to hitting a wall or obstruction in your way. That means that either you are lucky and the cupholder will survive for another hit, or the flimsy interal holder will break.Well 2 days with the cup holder on, and scenario 2 occured. It blows me away that Bugaboo designed and built such a poorly thought of accessory.I gave 2 stars out of 5 for the following:minus 1 for being over priced for what is already a expensive strollerminus 2 for breaking its functional use.The thing can still hold a bottle, but not secure."
181664,1,"Big bag with plenty of space and lots f pockets. Can fit baby's items for the weekend, or anday out with my belongings as well. Light, durable, stylish without looking all fancy. Great for daddy to carry as well. A bit pricey, but better than the women's handbag styles!"
118429,1,"My daughter loves this tub! I bought it just after she was born and have been using it ever since. I tried traditional bathtubs that were big and cumbersome with my oldest daughter and never like them. When we ordered this I was a little skeptical about it's quality, but once it arrived I was happily proven wrong. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver which is a big plus when you have a baby in your arms. Its smaller size makes it convenient to store under the bathroom sink. She is so comfortable in it I can place her in while it sits on the kitchen counter while I wash dishes or on the floor while I clean other rooms. She stays happier longer in the tub than in the swing, bouncer, or bumbo seat we bought for a lot more money."
49110,0,"I bought this product for my 12 months boy. It worked good, but my son can shake it hard. Because it's light weight so be careful when someone hit it by accident, it can be collapsed on your baby."
147891,1,"This item is great!!! Kids love it and parents love it more! It's really nice for kids, with colors, music and they love using it!"
17133,0,"This monitor was better than the one we initially purchased (we had splurged on the color video monitor handset from Summer - which we do not recommend...we couldnt' see see the colors and the image was very small, we had to place baby just right to see it on the camera (or adjust the camera) and all we saw was the face...and I couldn't always tell if baby still had her soother in her mouth or not. We liked the larger Summer monitor during the 2 weeks it worked (great video, audio, lights that went off when baby made noises) however once the monitor stopped working out of the blue, we replaced it with a monitor that also came with a audio handset (from Safety 1st). The audio handset allowed us to leave the video monitor in our bedroom and have the handset to carry around the house - very handy. We also found that the camera with the Safety 1st monitor provided for a greater field of vision so we didn't have to worry so much about where we placed baby in the crib so much or having to adjust the camera after a late-night feeding."
102133,1,"I have been buying this product for a while now, and am never disappointed. Price is better than in the store, and delivery is quick"
64597,1,"I was hesitant after reading some of the negative reviews, but am SO glad I decided to give it a try anyway! We just got a puppy and this is so much easier than trying to climb over the baby gate that we got! I may be back to purchase another one! So much nicer to just step over that I am even going around the other way to get to the kitchen! Installation was super easy, done in 10 minutes!"
92277,2,"I used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter, causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose. The first time it happened I thought I didn't screw the top on, but then it happened again. After doing some research, this is a common problem with these bottles."
46975,1,"This came exactly as described. The only issue, and I'm not sure if it is just me, is that the new wipes don't seem to pop up and stay like the old ones did."
21606,1,"My grandaughter used this for almost 8 months. She loved the mobil on the top and that she could see herself in the mirror. I read reviews that the toys on the sides interferred with the baby's thighs. My grandaughter had pretty chunky thighs and the toys were never a problem. She liked pulling the toys off to play with them. The music was plenty loud but not too loud that is would annoy anyone. Also she liked the vibrator, but you have to remember to shut it off (we often forgor) if you want to conserve the battery life. I would highly recommend this bouncer."
165659,1,These diapers are great-they do not leak and they can hold alot. My little girl can sleep 12 hours straight and not have no leaks in the morning and the diaper is packed.
166166,1,"We really like these diapers. They are not as thick so it is easy for my active toddler to run and play, but they are much cheaper than cruisers. It seems like they even have fewer leaks!"
88142,1,"My 6 month old baby has been very busy for the last 3 months playing every day with his Tiny Love Gymini Deluxe! We received it as a gift, and it's one of the most used toys we have.My son has almost outgrown it now but the bright colors, musical animals and rattles really kept his attention until he learned to roll off the mat. We still use it with the dangling toys relocated to the toy box. I have even washed it several times and its held up just fine."
106178,1,I just had a baby Oct. 1. and for a shower gift I received this. I think it's more pratical that the other brand. And the good this is that you don't have to be buying refill bags for this. Just put a gargabe bag and it will work. I recommendthis product a 100%
120849,2,"I'm usually satisfied with my Amazon purchases, but we were very disappointed to find pieces missing from this baby gate. We didn't get a chance to try this gate becuase the box arrived without the upper locking set, rendering it useless. Most likely it had been returned by another customer who didn't care, as long as they received their refund. I will now only purchase toys, etc. online because I can't stand having to return things! For baby gates and similar items, we will go to a store and visually inspect before purchasing, rather than rely on other parties to ensure all pieces are included."
160950,1,"We bought our bag early last year we have used now for 8 months. I get alot of positive feeddback on our bag. I love it, we both are big hunters and the camo it awesome and I love the pockets and the fit. The only thing is the seams are starting to rip near the zipper on the stress points. So it is kind of a bummer I need to buy a new bag soon and I really didn't want to I wanted a bag that would last. But I really like the product and if they would just make the seams stronger I would buy the product again...."
74182,0,"The stroller itself is nice. I get tons of compliments on the color, and my kids seem comfortable enough. Good storage capacity. However, a big problem I have is when the stroller has the attachments on it-- be it just the canopy, the tray, the carseat adaptor (or the canopy together with either) it will NOT fit into the trunk of my car (99 Mercury Cougar), my mother's small SUV (07 Kia Sportage), and barely squeezes into the trunk of a Mercury Sable (a full size sedan!). So, wherever I go, I have to unclip/reclip the canopy and the tray to have it fit in my vehicle. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but the clips are strong and haven't 'softened up' any after 7 months of use (which is good for safety, but bad on my hands). If you have two kids that need to be placed in a stroller (which is probably why you're buying this anyhow), this makes getting in/out of the car a bigger production. Height-wise when folded up, I have no complaints- I am still able to fit groceries on top of it in my small hatchback. If you have a large-size SUV, this stroller isn't going to be a problem, but if you have a full size car, economy car, or small SUV beware that you may be clipping/unclipping too. Maybe invest in a pair of gripped knit gloves to save your fingers."
25069,1,"This is the best gate. Before we had children, we had a basset. The need for gates became apparent once we moved to a larger home. We ended up with door ways which are larger than standard doorways. We tried lots and lots of other gates. This was the only one that we could get to fit and that would open easily and leave an adult with two hands free (which after baby entered the picture became a very important item.) We love this gate, and in fact, still have one gate in place even though the ""baby"" is now four and the basset is now seven. It's sturdy, easy for an adult to open and has held up really well. I would definitely recommend it!"
66207,2,"I bought these Dr. Browns Bottles before I gave birth. I thought this would be a very good idea; however, I was totally wrong. I had try several different kind of bottles, no matter what brand or how expensive they are, my baby still got gas.Besides, washing these Dr. Browns bottle is a very time consuming job for a new mom. You have to take every pieces apart to wash, that's too much for a tired new mom. Plus this is not cheap! I don't care if it's expensive or not as long as it works, but these just don't work as advertisied! For all new moms, please save for your money, any traditional bottle works same as these."
169839,1,Really great changing table worth every penny. We have been using it for around a month now and it is perfect. The rounded bars are fantastic and it is the perfect height to change the baby without getting a back ache. Highly recommended good quality. Easy to assemble.
140407,2,"We bought this swing because of the ac adapter and also the music. We have had nothing but problems with it. After two weeks the music quit working, the swinging action sometimes worked. So we called Fisher Price and was sent a new mechanical part. Yet again the music has quit and the swing occasionally swings. I would look elsewhere for a different swing."
96568,0,"I went to Babies R Us and looked at all the covers they had - I liked a few of them, but I really liked this one best. It provided both coverage over the face (yet still lets baby breath) and was so easy to put on - and I don't have to take it off each day. They only had it in pink so I ordered it here.The one drawback (and I guess this is a biggie for me since I am now on the search for a different cover) is that it's so short in the feet. Since I've gotten this, my 6 month old's feet are smushed inside.To help you visualize, just place a blanket or something over the carseat and pull it taught with the shape of the seat. If your child's feet are longer (or if his shoes are on), he's kicking it. It drives my poor son crazy.This may be very good, or close to perfect if you have a newborn, however, if your baby is a few months old at the beginning of the cold season, you may want to keep looking.PROS: Cute, keeps baby very warm, does not get in the way of car seat operation at all.CONS: too short"
172966,0,"The color and material are cute and nice. It can cover my baby in her infant car seat also. But it's only good for Summer evening though, not for Winter usage. For Winter, the BayBjorn cover is much better. And one suggestion to the manufacture: It should have a hood instead of a flap. Anyway, I own both: this one and the BabyBjorn one for different seasonal usage."
42161,0,"I agree with all the positive reviews of this hamper--clean look, easy to fold away, decent size, nice to have mesh bag to carry to laundry, easy to wash & dry...BUT...no one has given this warning: DO NOT WASH ON HOT! My exterior hamper bag shrunk, & since it attaches to the wooden framework by underneath velcro, I now have an ill-fitted item in my son's room that looks a shambles. I will have to buy some velcro extenders to make the ends meet again.IN ADDITION, the wood dowels that cross the bottom, holding both sides together, are continually popping out. Maybe a little wood glue will do the trick...but, do I buy an item that I need to retro fit to continue using as it was designed? No. And neither should you. Nearly three years of use, and I'm searching out a replacement, while I consider needing another hamper for Baby #2's room, too.AND...that mesh interior needs a wash now & again too (think POTTY-TRAINING boy's soaked undies...). It ripped much more easily than I could have expected on the in/out carry-to-laundry use I put it under, even though I washed it in delicate.Frustrating hamper. Too bad. :-("
2616,1,"I have used many diapers and I have found that Pampers Baby Dry are the best. For cost, leak, rash .... etc. Everything is great compared to other diapers and we will continue to use Baby Dry until we get to the potty training stage."
159390,1,This bouncer is the best! W orginally purchased the Papsan seat and our newborn loved that but once she started focusing things with her eyes she was bored and would fuss. We then got this one and she will sit in it for hours and will watch the fish and starfish bubble around. It is very soothing for the baby and mommy also!I would recommend this one before any other!
163117,1,"We got this travel crib as a gift, and after using it for 7 months, I am still very happy with it. If you have experience setting up tents, it's very easy and intuitive to assemble. And I disagree with the other review saying you can't put the ""therma-rest"" mattress in the bag with the cot - it fits fine if you deflate the mattress well. Our baby is now nearly 10 months old and sleeps very well in this crib - it's dark and cozy (which he likes), the mattress is comfortable (I can attest to this, as I generally crawl in there and curl up with my baby and spend some mommy nursing time in there with him before he falls asleep), and when it's zipped at the top, it holds heat in well. We have taken this travel crib to Europe, B&B nights away, etc., and it fits in a suitcase (although it takes up most of one suitcase) and it has a relatively small footprint. We haven't tried using it outside. Overall, I think this is a great travel crib."
62477,1,"Nice and cheap through Amazon -- product is exactly what we need for our child's formula-drinking needs. I would prefer to just use a bottle and not have to continually pay for drop-ins, but my wife prefers it this way."
164244,2,"These diapers are dangerous and should be on recall. Pampers should be sued and put out of business. I was so surprised to find out that the extreme rash problem with my twin girls (yeah both of them) was caused by these diapers. I say this because since birth I have used Pampers and up until my daughters started using size 4 there was no diaper rash let alone this severe.I am disgusted that I failed to recognized the source of the problem earlier, but that just goes to tell you how much faith in the Pamper name we as parents had. I have no idea what is the difference between size 4 and the lower sizes, but I will NEVER buy a Pamper product again.My girls had such extreme diaper rash that they bled. We kept on blaming it on the heat and the baby wipes and even the diaper rash cream. We must have 10 different types of diaper rash cream in the house.Believe me when I say that in this size (size 4) the diaper is different, they did something, added/switched/deducted some ingredient.I don't know if the reviews for this diaper that received 5 stars are reviewing the size 4 or other sizes but they should allow this particular size to be reviewed by itself.Read all the one star review, almost everyone had the same problem. Over 100 reviews regarding diaper rash.Don't let the low price allow you to buy this dangerous product. I will be contacting Pampers directly as well as Amazon to inform them about this problem, in which I'm sure they both already know about, because I've seen reviews of Pamper representatives.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
131914,1,"We bought this because we saw it as a great way to eliminate 1 piece of baby clutter by combining the baby swing with car seat storage. It is a fantastic product that makes my life easier and is well worth the money. When I know I need to do errands and my daughter is due for a nap, I put her to sleep in the car seat in the swing and then we're good to go whenever. So far, she is young enough to stay sleeping when we come home but I can see where it would help later on to keep her sleeping after she falls asleep in the car.Like the other reviews, my minor complaints are that the controls for the sound and vibrations are very poorly located where you can't see them to operate them. I don't mind this at all because frankly, I find the Graco music boxes (on this swing and our pack-n-play) kind of creepy and I don't use them. The music doesn't have a nice ""tinkly"" sound like many baby music boxes and instead reminds me a little bit of a ""twangy"" organ sound like in a creepy movie. The motor is rather noisy but, hey, it doesn't bother my baby and the repetitive clicking sound might even sound something like a heartbeat to her. I think the motor is able to move such a heavy combination of baby and car seat by having a *very* smoothly gliding swing mechanism. I notice that if I put any pressure at all on the swing (like pushing in a pacifier), it can't swing against it. With this type of mechanism, I expect it to last a long time and it really don't go through batteries as fast as I feared it would.Overall, I highly recommend this product. I only took off 1 star because I feel like the controls could be easily relocated by the manufacturer and because I really dislike that music."
47939,1,"I installed the gate at the top of my stair case (using the hardware mounts, not the pressure mount system). The installation was quick and easy. The gate operates with similar ease. The clear plastic makes the gate more aesthecially pleasing than most other gates and so far seems very sturdy. For the price, this item can't be beat."
94336,2,"If your newborn is a sucker like mine, do not get these bottles. The newborn nipple is too fast. I bought the entire line, having heard how wonderful the bottles were. Well, my kid gags and sputters through every feeding. I have read all of the tricks to get the bottles to not leak, it's a waste of time. I have switched to Dr. Brown, and they work great! Not to mention the ear ache issue of bottles without vents."
150829,2,"We bought the combo/tower and hutch and this 5-drawer dresser. With the tower and hutch, the errors were just in how many of which screws there were, and we were able to make up the difference.With the dresser, not only did they send us not enough of the short screws, but they sent us ten LEFT drawer sides, instead of five left and five right. There is no way they can be substituted for one another, and now we have to have them exchange parts... the baby is due in just a few weeks - I hope we'll have the dresser in time.Additionally, the boxes were SO damaged in shipping (by FedEx) that we were afraid we'd have to return them. The wood was a little scratched, but not too terribly.The furniture is great stuff, but I'd buy it at the store so you can count the pieces before you even go home. It seems like the error is not in their quality, but in their brains."
62253,1,This is a very pretty cover! The bopy itself is great for nursing when baby is a newborn. And it is great when baby is learning to sit up. It is a nice nest for baby to sit in!
96861,0,Unable to comment and review the item accurately as this was bought as a gift for a newborn in the States and was delivered to her directly. I have not seen the item although the parents say the baby loves it.
2921,1,"I love my Boppy! I would sit in my rocking chair and have my newborn son on it so comfortably, that an hour could go by and we wouldnt have even noticed."
37177,0,"Seems well constructed, but I am not a fan of the cover being attached with Velcro. I think this is so you can swap covers, but snaps might have been a better choice as I can see this Velcro business being annoying. There is a lot of Velcro and it is quite sticky making opening the bag one handed potentially tricky."
172759,2,"We were so excited when we found this tub online. We could use the shower part for our oldest daughter until our new little one comes; and the tub was perfect for a little one. When we got it home and put batteries in the shower part.. it wouldn't come on. We thought maybe we did the batteries wrong and tried again. Still nothing! Finally, it decided to work but this time it would not go off. The motor is SO loud, it would definiately scare a newborn. Now, I don't know if it is the one we have or they are all like this, but I have to say we are VERY disappointed and plan on returning it. It was definiately too good to be true!"
106207,1,"I think the Diaper Champ is wonderful! It uses regular trash bags so I don't have an extra reoccuring cost, thereby saving me a trip to the local Babies-R-Us. The locking mechanism is nice and it's baby-proof so far (28 months and counting) my son won't be playing with his dirty diapers unexpectedly. It's also kind of cool how the diapers drop into the container below.I suggest either changing the bag every night or throwing really smelly poopy diapers in the regular kitchen trash as the Diaper Champ is not odor proof. This wasn't much of a problem until my son began eating solid foods though."
32835,1,"I thank GOD for this carrier!Even before my son was born, I knew I always wanted to use a carrier instead of a stroller whenever we need to go out, so I really researched the 'Net for my best option. This Baby Bjorn carrier always seem to come on top of the list, but it's sooo pricey (as compared to other carriers and even to other strollers)! After a long and hard think, I decided to go for this Baby Bjorn Tartan Navy and got it when my son was two months. As you can infer from the rating I gave it, I was (and still am) very satisfied. I was able to use it extensively -- in and out of our house. My son, from two to four months, wouldn't sleep anywhere during the day but in this carrier. Sure, he'd fall asleep on the bassinet or the bed but he'd almost immediately wake-up crying or screaming. So, I'd put him here -- lo and behold, he'll be drifting away to dream land in a few minutes.It's also easy to put on if your baby is already able to support his/her head. Otherwise, you'll need somebody else's help (to hook things up). It's also beneficial for winter babies because the thick padding can be an added source of warmth, not to mention your own body heat when you're carrying him/her. If you're 5'8&quot; or taller, you should consider the length of the straps -- try the extra-large ones.My son is now nine months and 20lbs+ and we're still able to use this carrier, but with the added (and very unwanted) shoulder and back pain. However, that doesn't deter me from giving it five stars, because the manufacturer warned that back pain may ensue when using with babies weighing 20lbs+."
59557,1,"These magnetic locks are not just cool, they actually work. I must admit that the instructions are bad. The instructions are small and aren't very clear. Once you figure the first one out though, it's pretty obvious what you need to do and you can do it without the instructions. Anyone that claims these come with quality instructions has a high tolerance for poor quality."
67057,2,"My 11 month old was able to pull the bowl off the tray in about 30 seconds. Trust me, I wet the bottom of the suction cup, made sure it was securly attached to the bowl, etc. Bottom Line: the suction really isn't great and it's just not worth the money (no matter how cute they are)."
94123,1,I dont know why but the same exact jumper can be found at toysrus(the actual store) for $19.99.
17873,1,"We and, more importantly, our son love this mobile! Our son gets really excited - kicking and grinning when he sees it! He definitely shows a preference for the mode with the light function on! The last few nights our son (3 mos)has turned it on himself by kicking the buttons when he woke during the night - I know it has to be a fluke but I'll take it - the mobile soothes him back to sleep! My only wishes are that there was a lower light setting - it's a little bright in a dark room, and I'd like a lower volume setting. Ours has quit rotating twice and both times we found that it was tightened down to tightly to the crib and operated fine when loosened a bit!"
24323,1,I love these sheets because they are a thick and durable material. They fit on a standard pack-n-play too which is nice. Definitely worth the price.
184829,2,Could be good for larger door knobs but in most cases children pull on the cover and it comes off to enter a room. Poor design and quality for kids who can reach a door knob. Don't bother with this product.
131898,1,"The SnugGlider is one piece used by the Graco SnugSeat or SafeSeat car seat systems. The purpose is to unhook the car seat from the base that is in your car, then snap the car seat into the swing inside the house or snap it into the stroller. I love this system. I've dealt with the other car seats where you have to constantly buckle in the seat. Never again. Graco's system is very nice. My wife and I love it. I reccommend the entire system, car seat, car base, swing, stroller. It certainlty has made our life a bit easier."
33933,0,"Overall okay, seems durable enough, the problem is if you want to use tops on your bottles (which my daycare requires) you would struggle to get this thing closed and if you put the coolers in there it will be even harder to close. I understand the tight fit, but this is too tight! Plus it doesn't stand up on it's own it tips and some people wouldn't like that. I would have purchased a different one."
87996,1,"We got this as a shower gift and our daughter loves it, at six weeks old it really gets her attention and gives her something to look at besides us! I use it for her &quot;tummy time&quot; and also on her back she stares at the black and white lines and the toys that dangle. I am sure it will continue to be a favorite as she gets older and can reach for the items, I only wish the have four dangle toys so that all sides would have an object. (they mat comes with three)"
144510,0,"These diapers do the trick and were a good deal, but I find the scent nausiating. I may be more sensitive to scents since I don't many scented items (lotions, detergents, dish soap) but the smell does not resemble baby powder to me. I do use baby powder on my child and the smells are not similar. nevertheless, they do a fine job and i found the size adequate."
137426,1,"My daughter loved this teether. It makes sounds when you crinkley sqeeze it and of course it's three different teethers. This was one of her favorites but sadly she lost it. Luckly for us she didn't need it anymore anyway.Overall, Great Value!"
148942,2,"I was getting desperate for additional support and based on all the postive reviews, bought this pillow during my sixth month of pregnancy. The first moment I tried it out, it felt comfortable, as it is very stuffed and does offer support. Within minutes, however, it became uncomfortable and then painful. The problem lies in how the top u-shaped portion is sewn--it is sewn so tightly and stiffly that it digs into your neck. When I pulled myself down a little bit to avoid this, the pillow became useless for two reasons. First, the side wasn't long enough to fit between my legs for support. Second, it didn't provide enough support for my head and I needed another pillow. This defeated the entire purpose. If only the pillow were either longer or had more flexibility/was sewn differently at the u-shape! I am five nine, and it was too short by several inches. We have a queen size bed, and it's true that this pillow takes up so much room that it's like having a third person in bed with us. If the pillow worked properly, it would have been worth it. It's winter now, and I was worried that as it got warmer, it would make me and my husband too hot."
87266,1,I use these bottles with my daughter who is two months old. She has been using these since week one (with expressed milk) along with the breast. She has no problem with switching back and forth which makes it great for me since I do not like to breast feed when I am out. I also freeze the milk in the pre-sterilized liners. I highly recommend them.
175953,1,"I was between the sizes on the carrier, and had to return the Medium for a Small. It's a great carrier for newborns! I recommend it to everyone."
66237,1,"These bottles are just the best on the market. Our daughter has used these bottles since she was 5 months old (she is now 14 months) and she just had her first ear infection! Dr Browns bottles really do prevent all the extra gas that can really upset your baby and ear infections as well. I have highly recommended these bottles to my sister and many friends who have had fussy, gasy babies and every singal one of them now raves about them as well. Both they and their babies are resting better. What a great baby gift! I would not buy any other bottle! That is the bottom line."
113218,1,ok so i had to have looked at over 300 bags when pregnanti ended up chosing this one because its uniquei LOVE the colours and patternand its laminatedso everything wipes off easilyand if you live in a rainy climateits totally rain proof toobonus
125343,1,"I bought this teether for my youngest son, he has been using it for a while now and loves it. He tends to prefer to chew on the green leafy part of the RaZ but it is so cute and he adores it. He was confused at first thinking it was a pacifier and he couldn't quite suck right on the raspberry part and that is when he started chewing on the green. Our Doctor said that his teeth are SO close! Any day now would be great :)[...]"

40446,1,When my local Costco decided to stop carrying Pampers I thought the world would end. These are by far the best diapers and they had the best price- however in my mad dash to find somewhere else to buy them at a great price- I came across them at Amazon.com! What a life saver- and with the free shipping I couldn't beat that. The only draw back is that it took 2 weeks to receive them.
40291,1,"I love these diapers for my son, they give him a lot of movement and no Leaking which is always a great plus! I wouldn't use anything else!"
1497,1,"I've been using this service since last year and it's a very convenbient service when you don't have time or disponibility to go out to shop. I was out of the country and just ordered it, so when I got home it was already here. I didn't need to worry about my son diapers."
135110,1,"We have a kitchen with two door sized openings, one on either end. Two years ago when we moved in and our oldest child was not quite two we got two different gates. This one, and theEasy Step High-Guard Gate Color: Black. Of the two I prefer the Easy Step. They were both the same to install, and I like how this one opens both directions and how it snaps back closed is neat. But I would prefer that it stay open. If you get this gate and want it to stay open use a short bungee cord and hook one to the open side of the gate and one to the screw bar part. This will keep it open in case you need to walk through, like we do when we bring in groceries.The thing I like the least about this style is that it is hard to close, you need to put your hand on it and push down with your whole body to get it to lock in place. And the locking pieces seem kinda flimsy being small pieces of plastic. But it hasn't broken yet. Sometimes one of the screw paces on the top (usually the one by the opening of the gate) will loosen and make it so the gate won't lock. This might be from normal use, from the dog jumping on it, or my almost 4yo playing with it*.My almost 4yo can open the Easy Step, but I am not sure if she can get this one yet (since she just uses the Easy Step if she needs in the kitchen). I know she can not close it since you have to be taller then the gate to push down and get it to lock.UPDATE: it was my oldest playing with it that made it loosen. She doesn't have the height required to properly open and close it so she was unscrewing the side to get it to open."
58639,1,"Quick, effective, and can be used to sterilize some (not all!) teethers and pacifiers, too. I used this religiously up until my son was about 8 weeks old. Worth every penny."
146523,1,"Every peice had to put together, but worth it, my grandughter loves it. All the retail baby stores were out of stock, but Amazon came though again, and the chepest of all."
161470,2,"The insert is the only thing I really used for my son. I received this as a babyshower gift and was thrilled cause I didnt even think how I was going to bathe my little one. But I only used the slanted insert, and the tub was so hard his little kicking feet pounded on it, sounded painful. It leaked, and wouldnt stay clamped shut... so we just used the insert sling. That was wonderful, but you could buy that for a lot less money by itself."
19443,1,"The snuzzler is one of my favorite things to use for my preemie son. He was a larger preemie, coming home at 6 lbs, but it's still a great help, as he was still small. It makes car rides enjoyable for him, I think he feels cuddled by it, just as we cuddle him. It's also great to sit him in if he's having a rough night sleeping....we'll sit him in his carseat and within minutes he's out like a light."
144946,0,"I am not sure if I just got a bad apple, but when my pacifier came I opened the bag and it smelled weird - like rubber on a tire. The pacifier also tasted like you were sucking on a tire and my 4 month old was not impressed. I think it's a great idea to have the frog attached to the paci and my baby likes to play with the frog but the pacifier tastes weird to him and he won't touch that."
66515,1,"Only used it once so far, but works great. Sheet keeps falling off but my 2 year didn't seem to mind. I like how the raised edges keep all her stuffed animals in the bed."
8989,1,this cd player stinks. its not very loud and the batteries die every couple of days. the batterys are also hard to change. its more trouble than its worth.
171206,2,"I bought the tub from Amazon. It didn't come with a hammock, but I thought I must have read it wrong because I was reviewing many different tubs. I was too busy to go back and check after it arrived. So I kept it 'as is', liking the infant/toddler advantages. Let's just say it was fine for the first couple months. But when my baby started wiggling and kicking his little legs, his little bottom would be on top of that divider and would continue to slide down farther. I spend every bath frantically holding him in place with one hand. This is a horrible tub, I hate it. The one I had for my first child was another of these models and I hated IT too. He is not old enough to use the toddler side yet, he just turned 6 months. Man, I can't wait to get him on that other side."
183559,2,"I wouldnt get this product. I got this for my son, so that he can play and such! Well, its broke. the first day i got it, i tried putting it on and there it goes, right in the trash! you get what you pay for!!!"
21054,1,"After researching many strollers I decided on this one since it was the lightest and most compact. I was very happy with it, it steered nicely, easy to fold up (which was important, as I only drive a car not a truck). If I had to complain, I'd say I wish it had a bigger canopy, also maybe a little more comfortable. My kids never complained or looked uncomfortable but it doesn't have much padding. I also own a Peg Perego Twin Aria, which is more comfortable and has a front tray which is nice but it's not a compact or lightweight."
175999,1,"I'm on baby #2 and bought this sling the very day she was born. I must say I love this product and use it multiple times a day. As a mother of an active 2 year old, I have to always have my hands free. I also have the Moby Wrap and Baby Bjorn from my first, but so far, I prefer the Baby Ktan.Pros:1) SO easy to put on. Put it around your neck while holding baby. With one arm holding baby, slip one arm through a loop, move the baby to that arm, slip the opposite arm in the other loop. The Ktan NEVER touches the ground and your baby is always in your arms to avert the hold-me-cries which is the reason you need the sling in the first place. The Moby wrap is SO cumbersome to put on, it's not worth it to take out of the house. You definitely need two hands to tie the darn thing in place and the vast length of material inevitably touches the ground, which can be gross if you are at a restaurant or public place. Baby Bjorn is easier to put on than the Moby, but still more difficult than the Ktan. Since there are buckles, usually someone else has to be holding baby to put on.2) Relatively easy to get baby in. This takes some practice. The Ktan and Moby are similar in this regard, but I don't use the extra midsection piece for security since I'm not doing major lifting. I find that if you spread the fabric of each loop out to cover the baby twice, the extra midsection piece is not necessary. Right now my daughter is only 7 weeks old and I pretty much use the Ktan to get her off to sleep or go for walks. If I ever attempt to do more strenuous activity (housecleaning, tackle football), then I'll definitely consider taking the time to place the extra piece.3) Easy to get baby out without waking her. Since I don't use the midsection piece, I simply peel each loop off her back and butt, lean over the crib, and slide her onto the bed. I find that the lifting motion required to get baby out of the Baby Bjorn usually wakes them up.4) Easy to wear when not in use. I don't find the sling particularly fashionable, but if you are in a situation requiring baby to go in and out frequently, it's nice that it is lightweight and stays out of your way so you can drive and walk with ease. I've never left the Baby Bjorn on sans baby, but I imagine its stiffness does not lend to convenient driving.5) Easy to pack. The Moby is huge and difficult to pack, as is the Baby Bjorn. I can throw my Baby Ktan in my diaper bag or purse and have room for other items.6) Saves me the hassle of getting a double stroller - so far. I just pop my toddler in his single stroller like I normally would, throw the little one in the sling and get going. I know this is short-lived while she is still so tiny.Cons:1) The small ring that holds the loops together serves to tighten the wrap once baby is in place. This can be difficult to reach if too high up. Putting on the sling so this ring is within reach takes a little practice, unless you are a body contortionist.2) One size does not fit all. I'm 5'3"" and 140lb (hopefully 15 pounds lighter in the near future!) and wear the size small. My husband is 6'3"" and probably would not be able to fit the sling. This does not pose a problem for us as he would ""never be caught dead wearing a baby in a sling."" But definitely a consideration if your husband would.3) Price. At $10 more than the Moby Wrap, I had to seriously consider whether buying this sling was necessary when I already had the Moby. It's just a few pieces of fabric! Why so expensive? But since I figured I would never have the time to tie the Moby wrap while chasing around my 2 year old, it was worth the money.4) Nursing baby in sling is difficult for me. So far, I haven't had much luck using this to nurse. Maybe it's because I'm on #2 and have much fewer qualms about just whipping it out in public.So after 7 weeks, I'm still loving this product better than the Moby and Bjorn. We'll see if it stands the test of time."
33814,1,Burt had a great idea in assembling his baby products into a trial size kit. I've tried them all on my 5-month-old and both of us love them. The sampler kit is a great way to try the entire line. One of the best items in the kit is the Buttermilk Bath Powder! I love the way my baby smells after her bath.You can also keep this kit in mind as part of a shower gift.
114631,1,"I loved my Graco high chairs in the black and white damask pattern because they were really cute. BUT, I have twins and so I had two of them, cramming up my breakfast nook. They take up a tremendous amount of space. And, although they clean up beautifully, it takes some time to do so (you have to wash & dry the fabric covers, then scrub down the whole frame) . These Healthy care Deluxe Boosters take care of both of those issues! I now have a ton of room in my breakfast area and spend a tenth of the time cleaning them! That means more time doing the stuff I want to do like play with my kiddos!!"
162808,0,"Alright, I will confess that I bought this at Babies R Us because I liked the concept of the trap. I thought that this would be great for my little one since she is 10 months old and loves hand feeding herself. The lid stays on when she eats, however she pulls out fist fulls at a time. Also she likes to shake it upside down and dump it all out. So, maybe not the best idea for under 2 years of age. I guess I will look for something that she can't make huge messes with when we are traveling. I would suggest to friends, but only for the age it really doesn't matter to have special lids on it so they pick food out one by one. This one doesn't work for me at least this young of age."
118823,1,"I bought 2 - one for a 5yr old and one for a 3yr old. I chose this one b/c it folds for travel. We had a 9 hr flight to endure on our way to our new overseas home - and I DID not want to have to carry big clunky seats around big airports! Therefore I also bought the carrying bags for each seat (now there is an entirly different review - they are very thin and provide as much protection as a sheet with a zipper!) We put both seats into checked baggage, and I was so worried that they would be damaged. They made it beautifully! I was amazed - cause you know how luggage gets thrown around - and we did have one bag that was destroyed. So I can completly attest - they are VERY Durable!!!The kids both love these seats, they seem very comfy and they love the cupholders. The arms lift up for easy entry and it is very easy to adjust the height for a taller kid. I am also very happy that the seat belt is very secure in the guide of this seat - no amout of kid wiggle is going to pull it out. It puts the belt in the perfect position for them.My only complaint is it is a little tough to get them to fold and unfold. Maybe they just arent broken in yet - but it takes a little muscle, brain power and patients right now.I have been through MANY car seats in my time - I was the pickiest about everything when they were babies! We were giving up 2 Britax Marathons to move into these. I was tired of having to pick up my large 5 yr old to put her in the Britax in the SUV - plus it was time she learned to latch and unlatch herself for drop off in the school line! This is the first booster that I have bought and I expected to go through a few before I found one I liked. I was wrong - we love these seats!!!"
171117,1,We are buying our 2nd one to have in the car and an extra to wash. Our son loves to snuggle up with the dog. He sleeps with it every night. We have washed it numerous times and it comes out looking great. Definitely worth it!
42082,1,"I love this bumper! It is thick and luxurious, and makes the room look rich. I didn't want a whole set, because I think it's too much, so I bought cream sheets and a pretty cream fuzzy blanket. The bumper sets the theme. LOVE it!"
82832,1,"I LOVE this thing!! It keeps my 4 month old happily sleeping in the car when we stop at stoplights!! I can also turn it on and give it to him if he is crying and it soothes him!! Totally worth it, I would buy it again!"
170817,0,"This is an OK sheet. We have a Graco Pack n Play. The sheet fits well, washes well and doesn't shrink. But it's thin, and not that soft.The Eddie Bauer playard sheets are much nicer, and much better quality, fit well, but I could only get them in cream and brown. I needed other colours so I tried out the Graco. If the Eddie Bauer were available in other colours, I would definitely buy those.Also, for buyers out there, Chicco playard sheets are too small for the Graco Playard."
139237,1,I am very satisfied with this little lady bug night light. It is so cute and our whole family loves it. My daughter is too young to appreciate it now but I know that she will.
121095,2,"I bought a 5-pack of these, in addition to the disposable liners and the extra-absorbing liners that were supposed to work overnight.I tried them on my daughter one day, when she was 3 months old. I put an extra absorbing liner in, two disposable liners, then even added some rubber pants on the outside. Not only was the diaper so big and bulky that, if she were able to crawl, I doubt she could have, but within 2 hours she was soaking wet even through the rubber pants. And she didn't even poop!Now that she's eating solid foods and drinking less milk, they may be more effective (I have no desire to try them again to see...), but they're supposed to be useful from birth.I felt it was a complete waste of $75 (the diapers plus all the liner costs). I'm all for saving the environment, but if I used these I'd have to change her every hour. It may help the environment, but doing all that laundry would create a drought where I live."
147247,1,"The changer is the best! i have all i need in one place... My newborn sleeps very confortable in the bassinet, i haven't use the canopy yet, i should have bought the one with a mobil. This graco pack n play its bigger than other models so you will have plenty of room to change your baby from position"
13103,2,"I had this installed on our car seat thinking it was a great product. I then went to a car seat check point and was told by the technician checking the seat that these were very dangerous. They removed it and got the seat just as tight without it. Highly recommned not buying. If you take your car seat to most fire stations or police stations (call ahead), most are happy to assist in getting the seat in correctly and snugly!!!"
60053,1,"My baby is 6 weeks old and I have been using it since her first tub bath. She fits in it well - she doesn't slip around - and she enjoys bath time. I do put a small towel down just to make it a little warmer and more comfortable for her. My only complaint is it is a big tub, but I knew that when I bought it."
81402,1,"I had initially ordered the Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller from amazon after reading the fav reviews. However, during the very first stroll to the mall our 7 month daughter gave us her review. She has the habit, like all babies, of leaning her head against the sides. The Jeep stroller lacked padded support. This stroller has padded support, a big basket, and is easy to move around. If you are budget conscious and are looking for a stroller in this price range, this product wont disappoint you."
13186,0,"We had gotten this seat belt tighter for both our cars - a Subaru Outback and an Audi A4. For the Subaru, the Mighty-Tite was too bulky to work well - it was pushed up against the car seat and it was difficult to tighten completely. It fit well on the Audi, but when we got our car seat installation inspected, the police office checking our seat said that she did not recommend this product. She has actually had one break while installing it! Since it is not made by the car manufacturer and not made by the car seat company, you should be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security just because you have this product."
163884,1,"I use this every day when in the sun and many days when not outdoors.It feels great, and has good sun protection"
117020,2,"The bag arrived, and was exactly like the picture except it was MISSING THE DRAGON.Did my dragon come to life and fly off the bag? It's possible. But when I order a ""dragon bag"", I want there to be some form of dragon on it.Returning it.... too scared to purchase another without a Dragon Guarantee (tm)."
162315,2,"This was totally worthless. The thermometer didnt' work. The bulb syringe was too small and the hospital gave us a good one when we brought our baby home. I returne this right away. Invest in a good thermometer. We bought one for $ that can be used under the arm, in the mouth, or in the rectum and is quick and accurate and we needed the peace of mind that it gives us knowing it really works!"
151807,1,We used this toy as a fun prop at our wedding on 7/7/7...everyone got a kick out of it...we added chocolate coins spilling out as a treat.
35530,0,"This item is a must have for every mommy. My husband purchased this for our first son when he was 6 months old. We keep in the back of our car for shopping trips and eating out. Our oldest is now 2 1/2 and still puts his mouth on everything, a habit we're trying to break. It puts my mind at rest knowing that he's not ingesting all sorts of germs when he does it. If the seat gets grimy while eating, all you have to do is through it in the wash. The only reason that this is not getting five stars from me is the fact that ours didn't come with a carrying case, and it is a bit wild to carry around because of that."
75690,2,I bought this mobile to match the crib set. All the cocalo items are pricey junk. The turning/musical part broke after 2 months use. Don't waste your money on this garbage!
19624,1,"I am new to breastfeeding and babies in general, so we bought these prior to giving birth. I haven't really used them too much. Technically you could achieve the same result with a warm damp towel, but then you'd be wet. You could also make your own with rice and sock, but that can get messy. The shape of these is useful and they are small enough to wear tucked into my tank top. When I have had a clogged duct, they have helped to make it go away in a shorter amount of time. I don't know if they are necessary but they are helpful!"
116872,1,"Arrived quickly, was exactly what I wanted as it was a gift for someone. They really appreciated it and says it is great."
178519,0,"I loved my bjorn when my baby was a newborn, but after she got a little bigger I felt like all of the weight was on my shoulders! (and yes, I even went to a baby wearing expert to adjust it- it did not help) And I read that the ""crotch"" hold of the bjorn can compress a baby's growing spine. I switched to the Ergo Carrier at about 4 months and could not have been happier with the Ergo- all the weight is on my hips, and although she faces inward in the front carry position, she can switch to side or back carrier to see more. (and it is great when she falls asleep!)"
81789,1,"We love this changing pad - it's big enough that our son will be able to use it until he's out of diapers. The contour was really nice when he was smaller & the length is great. It's really nice to be able to wipe off if it gets messy, but it's cushioned, too, so it's comfy."
162666,1,"I had no problems with this tub. My son is on the smaller side and we only used it until he was six months or so, but I didn't find that it leaked and it was compact and easily stored between bathtimes.I would recommend it."
54176,1,"When my wife became mesmerized watching this mobile in action at her sister's, I knew we had to get it. It really is amazing how all the parts twist, twirl, and rotate. There are so many different motions going on, it's impossible to get bored watching it. The music is nice and soothing. The contrasting colors are great for getting your little one's attention and focus. We were confident that the time spent with this mobile was really developing her senses. A ""Must Get""."
102915,0,"I like the fact that it uses regular trash bags. I put in a new bag every time I empty it and trust me, there is still an odor. If you put in stinky diapers, you will smell them. I, too, have been unable to find repacement odor chips. I have been using stick-ups."
181377,1,"Mine was not missing any parts, although the box looked like it had been damaged during a Customs inspection. This is a robust, well made stroller for two. I have a 35 pound toddler and a new born, and ALL the other strollers I examined were flimsy, too small or both. While its probably not worth the selling price, it is in a class by itself so the manufacturer can ask for top dollar. If you're a small woman or you own a compact car you might want to look at a different stroller. If you want a sturdy stroller for two that will last for years - well, you get what you pay for."
50024,1,"I never write reviews on products, but I just couldn't pass this one up! I just bought this hip hammock to try it out. My 6 month old daughter loves to ride on my hip, but I find that after a few minutes, she gets heavy, then I am switching her between hips, and when I'm shopping it's impossible to carry her, sign receipts, push the storller, hold the 4 year olds hand, etc. This Hip Hammock really frees up BOTH of your hands and makes it so much easier to enjoy baby riding along. My daughter loves it too. She likes being close to me and and loves being able to look around at the same time. She is so comfortable and content when I have her in the Hip Hammock. We have a baby bjorn and a Nojo sling, but this one is by far her very favorite and mine too! I recommend this to everyone I know!The only thing that took a few minutes was reading the directions and getting it strapped on and adjusted so it fits you and baby. I found myself really looking at the picture on the inside pamphlet for exactly how the lady with the baby in that picture was wearing it and how the baby fit in it. Once you get it on correctly it is SO easy to adjust and put on and take off! Because I am a very petite woman (5'2"", 105 lbs) the excess straps are quite long, but I just tuck them in. It really seems like this would fit anybody from smaller than me to much larger given the amount of extra strap."
3663,0,"I'm shocked that someone doesn't like this spoon. My son loved his own spoon and I use the small one to allow my 6 month old daughter to ""feed"" herself. This distraction works so that in between her own ""bites"", I can spoon the food in. I have 2 sets and will be ordering more.OK, after using this spoon for a month or so... I discovered that it is heavier on one end so that when I set it down in the bowl, it flips out of it- messy and annoying but not a deal breaker."
117627,1,"There are several things that impressed me about the Bumper Jumper. It was basically ready to go right out of the box, you only needed to insert the seat, which was very easy. It was also incredibly easy to install. The clamp gave me plenty of room to get over our double sets of moldings. The clamp strength is perfect: good enough to keep it in place, but not so strong that I couldn't easily pop it off and move it. The jumper was really easy to adjust to my son's height so that he wasn't too far off of the ground. The spring was just the right springiness so my son could bounce without too much effort but not so springy that he was taken off balance. The bumpers are perfect to keep him from slamming against the door jamb and he loved it when I put the little toys in the tray so he could grab them and play with them. I am 100% pleased with this purchase. I love it and more importantly, my son loves it."
117848,1,"The siblings of the new baby in the home that received this blanket are jealous. This blanket was instantly received and the parents appreciated that it is machine washable and ""cute, cute, cute!"".Another happy baby!"
146334,1,"At four months, my baby is a bit too small for this. On the lowest setting, her feet can't reach the ground yet in order to get a bounce. But the product looks sturdy and engaging. It's a good next step from the bouncy chair because she likes to be upright and see everything around her.I'm giving it 4 stars because the firefly toy does not function. It slumps over rather than stands up, so my daughter can't really play with it. Also, the rainbow/cloud toy is missing the colorful rainbow stickers. It's only an aesthetic thing, but still, less visually interesting than advertised. And lastly, the seat is a bit stiff and doesn't turn easily. Hopefully, as she gets older, she'll be strong enough to turn around in it.One last comment, if space is a constraint, be sure to look at the advertised dimensions. The product is much wider than it appears in the photograph."
96796,1,"I purchased this for my son prior to his birth and have used it since day 1. I have used the heartbeat noise almost exclusively for putting him to sleep however when playing in his room he will now hit the buttons and try the other noises. originally I had this hanging by the velcro on his crib but once he woke up in the morning (starting at 9 months) he would un-velcro and it would either be in his crib or on the floor. I started putting it on the table near his crib and that worked best for me, I could easily hit the button if I needed more time on particularly fussy nights and it was out and being adorable. He has other non-noise animals to sleep with. I have had it and used it every night for 17 1/2 months and only changed the batteries 1 time. We love this also because when we travel it provides comfort and familiarity for him."
91268,2,"This monitor is terrible! I was not sure if I wanted to buy another one since our old one worked okay. But, it sucked up 9 volts like you wouldn't believe. I finally decided to buy another and bought this one. It's going back tomorrow and I will buy more 9 volts.The static is UNREAL! We can't even hear the baby!"
110580,1,I hate diaper bag. That huge nursery looking sag will be always with me? Hell noooooooo!!!!! But i needed something that holds few diaper and wipes. This deluxe fold and go is amazing. Everything i needed. It holds 3 size 3 diaper. 1 travel case ( huggies) wipes diaper rash cream ( mustella). In that zipper bag i put my credit card cash and my keys.And its a good 6 hours outside. I am breastfeeding mom so i dont need anything besides my fold and go. 10$????? You cant beat the price. Just 2 cup of frappucino price something useful for long time.
106513,0,"My daughter is 7 1/2 months old and we've used this since the day she was born. At first we thought it was awesome, but it's not containing the smells at all. I spray it with Lysol everytime it's emptied (every other day) and then scrub it with bleach once a month. Still, it smells like poopy diapers when you enter my daughter's room. I think the foam pads on each side of the shoot have warn down, it'd be nice if you could just replace them. However, I'm not going to buy another one knowing that I have to use a diaper pail for longer than the 2nd one would last."
104305,1,We bought this gate for our dog. The exact same gate from this company marketed for pets actually costs more and there's no difference between the two products. It's tall enough that it keep our big dog out of the basement. Sturdy materials and is generally pretty easy to open. And it looks pretty classy in the black finish.
49972,2,We bought this stroller thinking that it was the best. Warning: Warranty only lasts a year! My stroller began having problems unfolding within 6 months and now is unusable at 13 months. It will no longer unfold. I guess more $$$ is not always better.
174721,1,"I love the mobile. It has bright cheery colors and good size. It also arrived pretty quick, within a week of delivery."
118122,1,[...] This bed is very sturdy and good looking. My 2 year old loves his bed!!!
57737,0,I bought these to try in substitution for Seventh Generation diapers but I wasn't sold on them. They aren't as soft and well shaped as Seveth Generation (in fact I felt like the over size was kind of wasteful). I also didn't think they absorbed as much as Seventh Generation diapers.
141974,0,"Product works ok satyed stuck so far but, not enought to do crib not even enought to do front rail about 2 inches short"
114938,1,"This is one of the best things we have purchased. We have been using it since our son could sit up on his own and he is now 18 mos old and 27lbs. We take it everywhere - friends/relatives houses, even to restaurants in lieu of using thier high chairs.It straps to almost any chair and is great b/c you can use th tray and dont have to worry about bowls or eating off of a table.Cant reccomend it enough."
131480,2,"So far, we've used this once in a public place and it didn't fit the toilet. I was afraid of this after reading previous reviews and it happened to me too. I managed to carefully balance and hold a scared toddler (my daughter) to minimize the situation. Does not work on public toilets well - and there a NO changing that!!!!"
98166,2,When we opened the box that this table came in I immediately was struck by the peculiar smell of mildew/varnish mixture. Upon examination we found that the shelves had water marks indicating some type of water damage. The smell of the varnish was also too strong to consider keeping this item in a baby's room.
158171,2,"My husband is 6'6"" and I am 5'9"". We were so excited when we got this sling as a shower gift. But unfortunately we have never taken it out of the house! As an newborn, our son hated being tucked beneath the folds of fabric - his head was completely covered. When he began sitting up, we tried him in the sitting position, only to discover that (even on me, a TALL girl) the sling hit below my hip even when completely tightened. My VERY TALL husband got it to sit at his hip, but felt totally unsafe as our son was not secure in the sling unless the shoe-string-like cords were cinched tight. We worried about them rubbing on his tender skin. The baby was not comfortable and neither were we! The sling looks good and at first, seems like a fashionable, functional necessity. My recommendation: Spend the extra money on the Baby Bjorn. It is not beautiful, but my husband and I both wear it CONSTANTLY and our son is now 9 months and 23 pounds. It is safe and comfortable for both the parents and the infant!"
63163,1,"Attractive, make sure when you assemble it you utilize wood glue. Does the job, the husband weighs over 200 lbs and sits on it all the time."
151200,1,"Carried both my kids around in the same one for several years, from the time they newborn until 3 or 4. So versatile and adjustable. My daughter was fussy and wanted to be held all the time, this allowed me to work with both hands, or shop, or sit and chat with someone while she swaddled tightly and going to sleep when we traveled. My daughter wanted to face me and cuddle, my son wanted to look outward from day one.... both were accomodated and comfortable. I could also nurse discreetly! My daughter already has this item in her closet for when she has a baby!!!LOVED IT!!! I buy one for every new Mama I need a gift for!"
178483,0,Me and my wife have a 3 month old that has to be held. We have enjoyed having this product and put it to good use. So far we haven't had any problems with the design but like I said our child is only 3 months and doesn't weigh much. It will be interesting to see if it will still be as useful in the months to come. So far we are satisfied with the product and plan on continuing to use it.
48115,0,"I was a little disappointed to find that only one bolster comes in a package. I think it's really pricey to pay $40 for one in flatable plastic tube with a thin cotton cover. Anyway I went ahead and ordered another one just because I haven't found in other portable options for keeping a toddler in a bed. This one deflates flat so it's very easily packable. On our vacation my 2 yr. old son did stay in the bed but I'm not sure that it was the Bed Bugz that kept him there. One night I checked on him and the bolster was hanging off the side of the bed. He is able to kick it off with his legs. If he actually lays correctly on the bed I think it works ok but once they get turned 90 degress it's easy to move off. Then if they happen to spin back around they have no bolster protecting them from falling off. It would make more sense to me to have the strap go around the width of the mattress not the length of the mattress. However, I'm not planning on returning it because I haven't found any better options and it's better than nothing. I'll just have to continually check on it."
162879,1,"This is the greatest product ever. I'm buying a ton more for all the mommies I know. It's such a simple, wonderful idea. The materials are quality (soft, thick rubber and molded handels that are very sturdy). These snack cups have changed everything for my 13 month old. She is an independant snacker now, doesn't make a mess and loves the cups as much as any of her toys.I'm thrilled.Update: They now make an equivalent to the Snack Trap and sell it at local stores (like Target and Babies R Us). I prefer this new one. It comes in nicer colors (purple, lime green, orange) and the tops are harder to get off. The snack trap tops ended up looking very dirty (kind of yellowed) after a bunch of runs through the dishwasher. Also, the designs on the cups wore off very quickly and unevenly. I still think it's a great invention and appreciate how much it helped us, but I think the newer designed cups are better (they also have a rubber ""no-slip"" bottom). Also, they are the same price but you don't have to pay shipping."
144504,0,"These bags will contain the smell of dirty diapers a bit. It doesn't completely hide the scent, but definitely better than if you don't bag them at all. The bags do have a pleasant baby powder scent."
95970,1,"we've only had it for about a week. super comfortable. it can be folded to meet any needs we have. it on the big size; my wife is about 5'3"" and she claims she can notice that this was meant for someone a little bigger. i dont know..."
179849,2,"Be really careful of this one! We have been using the wipes for a few months and just this week we had a back log in the toilet. I was thinking maybe something else had happened and then the poor bowl couldn't take it anymore. The cost of the drain clearing was more then $150 USD! We came out with a grocery bag of kandoo wipes. I have only used 3 packs! I didn't flush more then the recomended amount and the backup happened at the end of our private line. If this is what they do at the end of three packs and a month or two, I can only imagine what happens to other people!Kandoo will be getting a bill from our home. Don't let it happen to yours!The product was a great idea for our son who was training. The marketing was perfect and we liked the orange packs scent. But overall with the misrepresentation of the product I have to flush this product down the drain....Ooops forgot, they don't flush!"
74554,1,"Yes, because this reflective surface is malleable, it can distort the image. But this is not a glass mirror and thank goodness for that--a quick stop or accident and it could fly into your baby's face! The warped image DOES amuse my baby and once I positioned it correctly, I can see baby's face in order to tell if he's sleeping or if his pacifier has fallen out. That's all it's meant to do. It is not ""cheap"" and ""flimsy,"" it is designed to be safe in the event of a crash. Surely this device is not necessary but I found it helpful."
79415,2,"I bought these sippy cups based on the great reviews, but I'm disappointed. Yes, they don't leak, but my daughter (2 yrs old) has a hard time sucking the milk/juice from them, like the spill proof seal is a little too tight. And even when she does get the milk out, there is always about a half inch left that she can't get out because the spill proof insert sticks out too much and doesn't allow the milk to funnel down... even when I tried to drink from it to see why she was struggling with getting that last bit out, I couldn't. Bad design... wasteful and it frustrates my daughter because she can see more in the cup but can't get it out."
74228,1,"I bought this stroller to take on our Disney Vacation for my 3 & 5 year old. (This is the 3rd double stroller I've purchased) It was a life saver. I knew my 5 year old wouldn't want to do all that walking. It was easy for him to get in and out. It is compact enough to fit in the back of my small car (VW Golf) which most double strollers aren't. (The last one I had to take the wheels off every time I put it in my car!) I was stopped several times and asked how I liked it and where I got it. (A mark of a good product if you ask me.) I did purchase the parent organizer which was also a life saver. I was able to keep all the kids important stuff (aka autograph books!) handy so anytime we saw a character we could get to them easily, and a cup holder is always a plus!One other thing worth mentioning is that it is a bit heavy for such a small stroller at 35 lbs. I looked into getting the ultra light but there is only a 5 lb difference. I couldn't see paying for the ultra light for only a 5 lb difference. But for those of us used to carrying around kids sometimes a 35 lb stroller isn't too bad!All in all I really like this stroller and would highly recommend it!"
165823,1,I feel like as my son gets older the pamper brand is not holding enough. I definitely recommend the newer pamper!!
88998,2,"Something in this brand gives my kid a rash. The rash is not wetness related, but seems to be from something in the band of the diaper."
166690,1,"I want to say, with this price, I think this is pretty good diaper. feels good and do the job!"
110149,2,The product description says that it works with all pumps but it does not work with the Medela Freestyle pump. It says so in the box. Amazon returned the cost of the items plus shipping but it was still a waste of time to have placed the order.
19870,1,"I've been using these for my daughter for almost three years now with no problems. They're portable thanks to the lids, and I've had no problems with the suction cups... I just rub a sponge or wet paper towel across the suction cup before I stick it to the table and it works beautifully."
99232,1,I CHECKED AROUND ON PRICES FOR PAMPERS AND THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST DEAL. FAST DELIVERY TOO!
47021,1,"Small but very cute! Good things come in small packages sometimes and definitely in this case. Very nice heavy expensive feel to them, without the heavy, expensive price. Nice addition to the nursery! Would be great if they offered these in a bigger form too."
70478,1,"My son is going on 10mon and has been drinking out of this cup religously for about a month. I do like it, it is a bit bulky but he has no problems holding it or drinking from it. I would give it 5stars but they don't make replacement lids for it which is the only problem with it. Our sippy doesn't leak normally but it has a few times. I love it and most importantly our son loves it."
66255,1,My aunt gave my mom these bottles for the baby shower because she used them with her son and loved them so do we! My brother got WAY more gas with the other bottles. These are exellent bottles!
29007,0,We have purchased serveral of these nipples. These are usually a hit or a miss in terms of quality i.e. some times the nipples do not provide the right flow.
15067,2,"I purchased 2 of these kits. We attempted to use the ties first and they broke when attempting to tighten during installation. Since the ties broke we decided to use the screws and screw the wood into the banister and railing. The wood screws supplied in the kit broke. We wound up using wood screws we already had to complete the installation. The materials supplied are of such poor quality, I will be returning one kit. I would return the other kit but the screw broke and we can't get it out of the banister. I guess we'll leave that up to whoever buys our house whenever we move next. Done waste your money. Go buy a piece of would and make a small block to use as a spacer if needed."
126366,0,"i ordered these diapers because at the time the subscribe and save option made the price only about $22 shipped, then the weight advertised states that it can fit a baby up to 15lbs. my son at the time weight about 13lbs when i ordered these and they were snug. by the time he was at 14lbs, the diapers were just a struggle to get the tabs on him and up high enough so that it'll stay on. the diapers also feel very cheap and papery which was nothing that i expected from huggies. i'm going to stick with pampers and luvs which has a better deal right now anyways. i think that if huggies made it less misleading and lowered the weight down to about 12lbs it would get reviews because the product would be advertised more accurately. unfortunately, these are more like a large ish size 1 diaper not quite a size 2."
16884,2,"After much research I bought this bedrail for our 2 1/2-year-old. I was very disappointed. I purchased this model because it seemed to be the only one that didn't have bulky rails under the mattress that would ruin the mattress and box springs. The product is very misleading in that respect. It has even bulkier rails than other models that fit 4-5 inches under the mattress (and they have sharp points that will tear holes in the box springs in no time), then the strap, then these worthless L-shaped bars on the other side that always turn sideways. Forget about trying to make the bed. An everyday chore has become an everyday nightmare. The rail is much harder to fold down than other models and those dang L-shaped things always come off every time you tuck the sheet. I haven't tried the foldaway thing, but it's not really a feature I need. I just want to make the bed. I purchased mine for $30 from Target, but still didn't get a good buy for my money."
135340,0,"1. I would consider the ""white pique"" to be a waffle fabric, not pique.2. It says that you can hand wash if you remove the bottom insert, but it feels like the top part of the stacker is a piece of corrugated cardboard sewn between two pieces of fabric. I don't think it would hold up to a single washing.3. The picture for white pique shows a single tie in the center. Mine came with two ties on the outer edges.4. This works much better when you hang it from a closet rod or towel bar. If you try to hang it flat against a wall, the bottom is not level. The front and back are equal lengths of fabric and both sides are designed to spread out from the top in an ""A"" shape.I'm going to keep this because it was cheap and the only white diaper stacker I could find. I really wish I could hang it from the wall and wash it, though."
120380,1,"I would not have been able to sleep had I not had this product! I bought it right before my daughter was born and she is 6 months old now,we have never had a false alarm with this .It took us about a month to get into the habit of turning off the motion detector alarm when we took her out of the crib for middle of the night feedings etc.but it did what it said and within 20 seconds when there was no movement it went off.The only drawback was one day I had a fan pointed at the crib(over the summer) while my daughter napped,I took her out and about 4 hrs later realized I had never turned off the alarm but it did not recognize she was not in the crib because the fan was lightly moving her mobile and that was enough movement for it to think it was the baby moving.I highly highly recommend this and am getting this as a gift for my expecting sister in law it really is a must have!!!!!"
41220,1,When my local Costco decided to stop carrying Pampers I thought the world would end. These are by far the best diapers and they had the best price- however in my mad dash to find somewhere else to buy them at a great price- I came across them at Amazon.com! What a life saver- and with the free shipping I couldn't beat that. The only draw back is that it took 2 weeks to receive them.
165136,1,"Pampers are the only diapers I can buy for my two children (ages 2yrs and 8 months). They get rashes from any other brand. Pampers are affordable (especially with the subscribe & save option), and they fit the kids well. They also absorb beautifully, so I don't have to worry about them waking up soaked. I would definitely recommend them to any new mother!"
116860,1,The Diaper Vest was purchased as a gift for my husband. It is great! The vest arrived quickly and was packaged beautifully.
117869,1,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It allows me to quickly wind up the cords of my window blinds and although the instructions say to trim the cord, I didn't need to."
64093,2,"This is a completely adorable, waste of time. It sticks for about 5 minutes then peels itself off the wall. I tried applying wallpaper paste to see if that would fix it with no luck. I finally resorted to using TAPE. Very frustrating."
46569,1,"I did a lot of research before getting this safety rail and I'm so glad I chose this one!We are using it for our 2 1/2 year old daughter who was moving into a big girl bed that is a little high off the ground. It is a captain's bed and I was concerned about finding a good, strong safety rail that would work with her new bed. WE FOUND IT!We are using a regular mattress, so we have not used the middle bar and we haven't noticed any problems by not having it there. Our daughter feels safe and sleeps comfortably and I sleep comfortably knowing that she IS safe!Even though this is on a captains bed, which has a little lip that keeps most safety rails with hinges from folding down, this one works perfectly because the hinges are raised just enough to be above that lip. I will upload a picture of this safety rail on our daughter's bed so you can see how well it works for beds like hers."
119409,1,"I was having problems nursing, and ever since I got this pillow, things have been a lot smoother. With the Boppy, the pillow would slip and the baby would drop into my lap. I could never get in a good position. This wraps around me and is flat, and at a perfect height. I wish I had had this from the beginning. It has made a world of difference."
178343,1,COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT!My son is colicy and has Reflux so he LOVES this thing. He calms down immediately when we put him in it!
31821,0,"Since a young age I have suffered from very sensitive skin. I work in a daycare and constantly am washing my hands, as well as children's hands several times per day. My skin becomes dry and cracked. Because of this I have been looking for a hand lotion that does not irritate my skin.I chose this product because of its claim that it is appropriate for children/adults with very sensitive skin. Unfortunately this product did not work for me. My skin soon became mildly itchy and red after applying the lotion. I will say however, that it did not cause the effects that some lotions have, which is swelling/hives, intense itching, and red skin which is slightly painful to the touch.I have not given up on this brand yet, my next try will be the Calendula Cream, and Calming Moisturizing Cream"
134800,1,"I was looking for a set for my baby and it was great not only the price, the material and the quality is great too. It's just all I need. Buy it!!!"
125131,2,It's too big and he ends up gagging on it. I'm better off with him chewing on his Soothie pacifier. Maybe eventually he will like it but for now he just gets frustrated.
41437,0,"The new pampers cruisers use new inside soft net like liner which first I thought would be great but they're not at all! They leave quite a lot of white lint on my son's bottom. I'm not alone in this case, a friend of mine has exactly the same problem for her daughter! Caution should be taken if you have a baby girl because the lint might get inside her private area. I really liked the old cruisers and I want them back!"
117035,1,"Exactly what I was looking for--has space for diapers, wipes, 2 changes of clothes, snacks, and even has front pockets that can fit sippy cups. I needed something to hold 3 sippy cups and this fits the bill. And DH isn't embarressed to carry it around!"
147218,1,"I bought this Pack N Play as a suggestion from my sister who has one of the more common and less expensive pack n plays. She saw this one and liked it much better and I now know why. I have used both ones for my little one who is now 11 weeks. I use mine as his primary sleeping place b/c our room is up and his is down. Anyway, when I took a trip to FL a friend was very generous to lend me hers which is the less expensive one. Well I really did not like the changing table part, it was flimsy and bent under his weight...he was 6 wks at the time and weighed about 8-9 lbs. The changing part was also much lower which was weird b/c it was so close to the bed part (when it's elevated for infant sleeping) and made it seem like you didn't want to stick your baby underneath it...hard to explain. Anyway, I love this pack n play and highly recommend it! PS Babies R Us does not sell this model even though it can be added to your registry...so weird I know, so order it here, it will be shipped free to your house in 2 days and cheaper than the BRU listed price anyway."
117821,1,This is a great space saving product. My 5 month old sons loves it and it is easy to take to Grandma's and on trips. Good quality as always from Graco.
97383,1,"If you can, buy the double pump. My doctor said it helps in 2 ways, takes half the time and it can even ""trick"" your body into thinking you have twins, thus making more milk.I didnt purchase the double pump due to the price. However, this mid-grade pump is just dandy for the amount of milk it can pump out in the time it takes. It makes for an easy and quick let down and the speed dial lets you choose how much suction you can handle.Dont get discuraged! The first time I used it it seem to work amazing! I got out 2 ounces in no time flat then the next time I used it it took me using it over and over throughout the entire day to barely reach the 2 ounce mark. I had also read another review that mentioned this: worked great the first time, then didnt work hardly at all the following times.... But dont get discouraged if this happens, it took my body some time to get used to breastfeeding and pumping. Not to mention, it always worked best for me in the morning- OR- if you are really dedicated, use it during the night inbetween your baby's longest period of sleep... you will get a lot more than when you pump after (even if its the morning) feeding your baby.I would have given this pump 5 stars but because sometimes the pump hurts my nipples. I dont have any comparisons but my doctor said when she used the Medela manual pump, it hurt her too.I would recommend this pump and its sister, the Easy Comfort Double Pump.NOTE: Please keep in mind how long you plan on breastfeeding tho. I wanted to keep breastfeeding for 6months so this would be a good investment but once my dr said I needed to supplement I ended up giving up breastfeeding just before 4months. I didnt get to use it as much as I would have liked, considering the money I spent on it. So, if you want a pump, consider this: renting one from your hospital. They ususally run about $30/month and you will get one that, if you were to buy it out-right, it would cost you $1,500. I wish I had done this instead."
953,1,"I started with pampers swaddlers, but moved to these after they changed over to drymax. I have not been disappointed since. I have never had a blow-out, leak, or diaper rash with these diapers. My son is a tummy sleeper and they I haven't had a leak overnight. If I had to say one bad thing, I do think they run a little small for my son who is a little chunker. So if you do have a chunky baby and your on the higher end of the weight limit just go up a size. These diapers are awesome and you won't be disappointed."
109096,1,"I love this pillow! I have purchased 3 of these and keep one in the car for both car feedings (while car is parked) and while visiting friends/family. This pillow actually works unlike the others since it stays on tightly and baby does not slip through onto my lap while either one of us moves around. And for those times I need to get up during a feeding, I can even stand up with her on the pillow (holding her on it) and go to the kitchen or answer the phone. Very practical!"
154560,2,"These are soft, I did like that. But as I think some other reviewer mentioned the fact that they have no design on them gives you no friction. You don't know how much you need that until you don't have it."
136352,0,"Early this year my sister and I both bought this exersaucer for our daughters who were born 1 month apart. We both independently identified pinch points on this saucer where our daughters caught their fingers in the exersaucer. My daughter caught her finger in between the turtle and apple as she was turning the turtle by holding it's head. My niece had gotten her fingers tied up in the blue ribbon attached to the telephone and other toys attached by the same blue ribbon. We both like the exersaucer because our children do enjoy it very much however, we are now aware of the pinch hazards and may not have purchased it if we had this knowledge in advace."
87651,1,"The sterilizer works great, no complaints. But the notes on the picture say that it includes 2 free soothie bottles worth about $6, and they didn't come with it. I chose this sterilizer because of the bonus bottles so I was quite disapointed."
143700,0,"I purchased this shade to put on the front seat of my double stroller, as the shade up there is a a joke....The connections on the Kiddopotomus are not designed for that sort of use and it was too awkward to be useful. It is now in a heap in the front entry way and I am considering a clip on umbrella for the toddler in the front of my Graco, but I gave it 3 stars anyway as it looks like it would do what it says it will on a single stroller that already has a largish shade to support the extra sunshade....and yes I know that it says it is for a single stroller, but there doesn't appear to be one designed for a ""single file"" type double stroller!"
88624,1,"Good diapers, I havn't had a problem with them. No leaks or anything. I have been using them since my son was born. I tried huggies, but always came back to these, because they are good diapers and always had the better deal."
42196,1,"My 8 week old is in the wrap as I type this. He ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS PRODUCT!!!! I'm a second time mom, and the first time around I used those standard backpack style baby carriers that pinch, pull and were highly uncomfortable. With my second child I was desperate to find a baby carrier that was comfortable to wear, small frame friendly (I am a 5'1"" woman) and one that baby would actually like being in. The Moby Wrap is that carrier. So soft, easy to wrap by myself, no pinching or pulling on the back, it truly uses the entire surface of the back for support not just the shoulders. My baby will fall asleep very quickly when he is in his wrap. Babies enjoy being swaddled and also being close to mommy, the Moby Wrap lets baby have both those things at once. With him being held firmly against my body I can move around with ease and do small household tasks as well. The wrap instruction booklet shows about 4 different ways to wrap baby depending on age and weight, plus has extra sections on baby massage while baby is in the wrap and light safe exercises while wearing the wrap with baby as well. When I go out I will wrap myself before I leave so when baby and I reach our destination in the car I can simply take him out of his car seat and slip him into the wrap and we're good to go.I love this wrap, and I'm sure you will as well. Very very very worth it!!"
175457,0,"Holds in poo pretty well, but gets slightly wet around the inner thigh and sometimes need to change my daughters onsie. We almost always need a new wrap when she poos. We use kisslauvs with it; maybe would have different luck with a different diaper. This worked better than the polar wrap, which soaked through. I prefer the all in one diapers,Bum genius and Kushies are my favorite. (Kushies are best value I think But I prefer Bum genius in general)"
50380,2,"I had a snoozle for two days and returned it. It was a pain to get comfortable with. It was like a tube that needed flattening. My mother bought me a bumpil from this little boutique downtown and paid about the same amount that I paid for my snoozle. This pregnancy pillow is awesome because it is so easy to get comfortable with and when baby gets here in just a few days, he can also enjoy the pillow because it opens up to a baby play area. Just My Opinion."
155817,2,This lamp lasted no time. The bottom of the lamp detached from the base within a few months of not even moving the lamp-and bulbs burn out quickly and are expensive for this product.
147324,2,We have static all night even after unplugging everything we own. I could live with that but now it has stopped working on A/C power and it's past the 90 day warranty (only 5 months old and it just sits on the nightstand)so it would cost me $60 for them to look at it. I told them that I am an electronics technician and if the would just send me the parts I would fix it myself but they don't sell parts so it's off to radio shack for a workaround.
94989,0,"I bought a Medela Swing couple days ago. I was very excited and tried it out straight away. The motor keeps turning off by itself and I need to replug the adapter into it every time. I inspected the round motor unit and discovered that no matter how firmly I plugged the AC adapter into the motor it would fall out because the mechanism that keeps it attached to the motor was faulty. It is very frustrating to stop and restart while pumping. And it happens 2-3 times per session. Also, I find that the suction is not strong at all, in fact it is very weak. Too bad I am not able to try another Swing to justify whether this problem prevails across all the product line or it just happens on my pump. How I wished I could return it. I regret that I did not buy the Ameda Purely Yours double pump instead (because they offer a 30 days Money Back Guarantee and the price is the same). I was weary about buying a pump becuase of the prices and not being able to test them. You can only rely on reviews. I spent all waking hours I have when the babies were sleeping to read over hundreds of reviews before choosing Medela (trusted brand??).Now I am not sure whether I bought a junk or not. I called Medela twice. First time they sent me a AC adapter which didn't solve the problem. Second time they promise to send me a replacement motor but I have to bear the cost of sending my motor back. I would be able to testify further when I receive it later. But at the back of my mind, I cannot help feeling frustrated and helpless. I felt like being punished for receiving a defective unit. As all Mom would agree with me, it is extremely cumbersome for me to drag my babies out to the post office to box and return the motor, and I hate to think that I need to fork out extra money to do so. It's like addition cost to maintain a brand new breastpump!!!!The replacement motor arrived in the second week (UPS 2 days delivery). I noticed that again the connection comes out every time I pumped. So this is a design defect after all. This pump prohibit me to move at all because if I jerk to bend a bit to reach for the TV controller or just to hold the baby, the connection would come off by itself and thus turning the motor off!!! Also, the max suction is still very weak which is why I can manage to pump 1 oz for 20min both sides. I inspected the motor and at the back of it was stated that this pump was labelled ""intermittent suction, medium vaccuum"". Do not expect a powerful pump if you opt to purchase this!!!"
113692,1,"I don't know how I would get by without this booster. I use it all of the time! My daughter is a wiggle worm and climber, so putting her in restaurant high chairs is just not an option. She easily slips out of them and is soon standing on the high chair--not good. Not to mention, some restaurants don't even have high chairs. This booster fastens securely to any chair, so you can bring it wherever you go. It's also a nice option to have around if you have children (nieces, nephews, grandchildren) visiting you, and you need an extra seat for the kiddos. The booster is easy to carry around because it folds up and the straps that fasten it to a chair can be used as a strap. I keep this in my car at all times and recommend it to every mother I know."
65025,1,"I ripped my hands to shreds trying to install this seat in my middle row (trailblazer 06) behind the driver's seat. I moved the front seat all the way up and folded over on the steering wheel to give me adequate room for installing this seat, and it was still difficult. The seat itself is very large and cumbersome to put in, and then I found (after much aggrevation) that the latch straps were about an inch TOO SHORT! I finagled that thing around for about an hour trying to get it to fit, and it wouldn't. I tried this seat in three different positions, first with a foam insert to elevate the recline (for an infant), second with a piece of foam that I took off a murdered foam noodle, and third time without ANY foam and flush against the seat. It still wouldn't reach. At this point, I was beyond upset and cursing the gods. I gave up and used the seat belt. Which was an event in its own right, because the clasps meant to secure the belt wouldn't close because the belt was pulled too securly (what???). It also took a lot of tugging on the shoulder strap to pull the seat belt tight enough to hold it in place (so it wouldn't move more than an inch). I have 4 kids, and have gone through numerous car seats in the progression of their aging. This has got to be the hardest car seat I have every installed. I did finally get it in, and it will stay there probably until I sell the car. And then I'll sell it with the car. My hands were bloody from scraping against the plastic while reaching my hand into the tiny holes meant to put the seat belt and latch straps through. And I have small hands.But other than all THAT, the seat appears to be very comfortable for my infant who is 6 months old and 23 pounds. I do recommend using a foam insert to recline the seat further (under the base, to tip it) that is recommended for the purpose such as that, if you have an infant. I got mine from the [...] website."
117408,0,"I bought this for traveling without a car. It's super-portable and well made.If your child like to push off with their feet, watch out! My daughter tipped over in a split-second during our first use. I was right there next to her, but I wasn't fast enough to stop the fall. After that I always kept either my foot on the base of her chair or my leg behind the chair. No freedom for the parents but still better than having her in my lap."
78282,0,"The Seat design itself is fine, and it's easy to set up, and pack up and take along to use in resturants if you don't like using their high chairs. The tray luckly is removable, because it's pretty much useless if your child has legs. It pressed tightly into my 7 month olds legs, which are chunky.....But, I think even smaller babies would have problems too. However, it does do just fine without the tray, and pulls up nicely to tables."
76119,1,"I purchased these to freeze my pureed spinach and bananas that I add to my morning smoothies. The tops are great, I can fill the trays to the top and the lids keep everything clean in the freezer."
17914,1,"I Love this product.....this gate opens up with ease, unlike the other gate I purchased having to pry it open with thoughts of cracking at the folds!! No problem feeling that way with this gate, it seems to close and open with no hassels and tucks away conveniently! Best purchase made, totally happy and satisfied..................."
20527,1,"My 6 month old just loves it, it is well worth the price and I would highly recommend it. He has been sitting in it since he was 4 months, the older he gets the more he loves it. We love it more than the doorway jumper that we purchased for Pap & Grandmas house. He has played in it untill he falls asleep and still he wants to keep bouncing. I clean it with just a damp cloth and I would never recommend giving a child anything to eat or drink in it (because of choking). This is my fourth child and I would say it has been the best out of all the baby equipment we have ever had."
149657,1,This set is fabulous. Super soft and the textures are great! My granddaughter loves it.
54990,1,holds steady. does not slide. easy to clean. it does cause my toddlers legs to be a bit red after sitting but so does the other floor based potty chair.
150247,0,"This cover is almost neon green. It's REALLY bright... so consider this before you buy it, considering if you like or do not like bright colors."
172700,2,"I started out liking this tub, but now hate it! It was okay for about 1 month. It's too short. The sling is too akward. I never even tried the sprayer. There's no room for it and baby in the tub. The plug does not stay in. I mop the floor at least twice a week, because of the faulty plug. I am still using the tub since I invested the money, but am not happy with it."
182757,0,"I had really hoped these would work. My son is approx. 18 lbs and gets woken up every night in the middle of the night because his jammies and sheets are soaked. They are good up to about 5 hours, but no longer for him. I think the problem is more that the pee trickles out the back of the diaper before it has a chance to soak in. He even sleeps on a slight incline because he gets stuffy sinuses at night. I think the Huggies Supreme are a bit more absorbent, but those don't work for him at night either."
18507,1,"After nursing my son for 8 months and him hating bottles (Avent, Playtex, et al) he fell in love with this bottle. He latches on and the bottle never hisses or bubbles up. I struggled with my daughter and never attempted this bottle and wish I did. It's worth the purchase. :)"
33309,2,"This seems like a well-made product. It slipped over my 10-month-olds head easily and fastened snuggly, although the straps attached to the buckles shown in the photo are tightened and held in place with velcro, which doesn't seem as secure. The major problem with this for us was that we were on a long overnight flight. Even though the vest isn't bulky, the buckles were placed so that they seemed uncomfortable when she was lying down in our laps. Also the loop that attaches to your seatbelt is on the back, so your child would have to be sitting up and facing forward for it to work. If you plan to shift your child from place to place, or have them lie down and sleep or nurse, I don't think it would work that well. In the end, we used it for 5 minutes and decided it wasn't really helping. Not sorry we tried it, it just didn't work for us."
93217,1,"Some people wrote about a metal rod under the cot that the kids could feel when they lied on it. Mine had no such bar or rod. Maybe I got an upgraded design. The material was pulled very taught in the center and that concerned me at first. After the first night this softened and now all the material lies perfectly smooth. My son loves this and finds being allowed to sleep on it to be a real treat. He just turned 2, so he's at the bottom of the recommended age range for this product. It folds easily and is not a struggle to stuff back into the carrying bag. I really like it and can't find anything wrong with it."
174405,1,This little peice of plastic is a great tool. This simple device makes for a more comfortable and enjoyable drive and because of it's simple design is great for kids as well as adults.
105900,1,"We love our Diaper Champ -- we have not had a problem with odors at all. We change the bag every other day, and our daughter is only 2 months old, so maybe her diapers do not smell as much as an older baby's diapers do. These could be reasons we haven't encountered an odor problem, but so far, so good. It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it."
52709,0,"This is a good chair for baby when he/she is older but not great for newborns. It is too big and they slide down in the seat too easily. The chair angle is not adjustable either so you are stuck with the angle it comes at. The head rest is not adjustable either so when baby slips down in the seat, the head rest is above his or her head. The vibration feature is good but it quits too soon, and you have to restart it. The music is nice. The cushion is good in this chair but it doesn't bounce at all- just vibrates and needs to be more adjustable so that babies can use it from birth on. Is a nice sturdy chair but not good enough for the money. I wouldn't buy it again."
105335,1,"Doesn't need special bags, easy 1-handed operation. If you want to reduce the stink when you open it to change bags then drop a stick-on air freshener in the bottom."
123349,1,"This playpen is the best thing I've bought so far. It's big, colorful, and fun! Baby loves it. It is easy to tote and set up as long as you know NOT to push the bottom down before you lock the sides. That's really important. Anyhow... great product!Graco Pack 'n Play Portable Playard in Bugs Quilt"
153110,1,I absolutely love these wipes. We've used them from birth up to now (4 months) and have never had a diaper rash or any irritation in that area. The scent is very mild and pleasant and the texture if very soft.
7964,2,The product I received is vanilla-orange scented! This is not indicated anywhere. I don't have the time for a return so I guess I'm stuck smelling like a creamcicle! Sucks!
163624,1,"We've only been using this for a week, but so far it is great. It is exactly what it advertizes itself to be a great highchair for the space deprived.I've already washed the pad once with no shrinkage and it comes off and goes on easily.Also, the tray is dishwasher safe. In earlier versions it wasn't but the most recent one is. It even says so right on the tray. Having said that, you better have a pretty big dishwasher or not plan on putting much else in the rack it goes on for that load.Another bonus... you can adjust the heck out of it. The tray adjusts in and out. The back reclines to about 45 degrees, sitting up straight and seems to have about 4 setting in between. And the height adjusts by about 2-3 inches up and down. All of these adjustments are pretty easy to make but you do need both hands for all but adjusting the tray in and out. Also, getting the tray on and off is pretty much a two handed operation.The harness seems very secure even for smaller babies. My 7 month old is only about 15 pounds. I would think you could go even smaller with a towel or some other padding behind the baby.My one VERY minor complaint is that when you're adjusting the height it is really easy to take the seat off its base completely. Of course, it isn't that difficult to put it right back on, but it can be frustrating if you've got a baby nearby fussing as you try to adjust the seat.So, thus far I would definitely recommend this and would buy it again myself.Jan 27, 2013Still. Really enjoy this! Just wish I could take the lower straps off for washing. You can take the top ones off which is nice."
183914,1,Have been extremely happy with LUVS diapers. Have used sizes 2 and 3. Leakage only due to my tiredness and incorrectly fastening them! Equally as good as Pampers Baby dry but cheaper. Excellent value for money. Box lasts 4 to 5 weeks. With urine it is sometimes hard to tell if diaper is even wet! Great product- recommended to all my mom friends. Also use Luvs wipes. That box lasted 3 to 4 months!
19953,2,Great idea but won't suction to our wood table or formica counter top. Only suctions to smooth plastic top of highchair. And have to resuction to highchair several times during meal.
160905,2,"I received this diaper bag as a gift, and wasn't going to buy a different one since this one was brand new and seemed perfectly fine. I used it until my baby was about 3 months old, then I just bought a bigger purse that I could throw some diapers and wipes in to and kept any thing else I might need in the car. The bag has several outside pockets, but if those have much of anything in them, there not enough room in the inside, and vice versa. My baby had reflux and we always needed at least a burp cloth and extra clothes most of the time. We tend to travel light, but this bag's design is just not efficient and there just isn't enough for a few diapers, wipes, burp cloth, and perhaps a few things mom or dad might need. I am about to have baby number two, so I thought I would try this bag out again, and before even leaving the house realized I need to shop for a new bag because this one barely fits enough for 1 kid, and definitely not what I will need for two!"
136045,1,"I absolutely love this monitor. I had chosen and purchased a different brand monitor when I first started looking for items when I was expecting. I read about the Angelcare monitor about two weeks before my baby was due, ordered it, and decided to give it a try (still keeping the first monitor I'd bought in case this one wasn't for me.) Guess what? The other monitor went back to the store unopened. The Angelcare monitor does everything it says it will do. We used it first in the bassinet, then moved it to the crib when my son started scooting himself around too much in the bassinet. Did I mention my son is a scooter? Yes, he is. The alarm has gone off once, when he scooted himself to the far end of the crib and I thank God that is the only reason it has gone off for us. The only other time it has gone off is when we've taken the baby out of his crib and forgotten to turn the main unit off. One thing to keep in mind is not to have a ceiling fan going right above the crib as the sensor will detect it as movement even if the baby is not in the crib. That is how sensitive the sensor is. It works great and allows me to sleep at night without having to keep one ear awake for peace of mind."
156735,1,This is a lifesaver!!!! My 5 month old loves this thing!!! He loves to bounce and bounce and all the little toys on top - he loves to play with. The great thing about this bouncer is that there are toys around the entire bouncer. I put him in here and I know I will have a minimum of a half hours peace.....sometimes he's in it for over an hour!! He loves all the different colors of the toys and loves to grab them and bounce. The best part of this toy is that it has adjustable levels so you can raise it as your baby grows.....I highly recommend this......
127591,1,"This cradle is so adorable, it a bit larger than a new style bassinet but it is large enough so your newborn can get some longterm use out of it. I would recommend it to any one who like old style furniture."
21212,2,"if you pull the nipple all the way to the sides, out will come a collection of 'things' from hair to lint to dry milk...one day while cleaning one of the pacifiers I noticed a piece of hair stuck to the base of the nipple, when I pulled the nipple to the side, the hair still wouldn't come off, so I pulled it really hard and along with the hair came a string of lint...I did the same thing to the other 3 pacifiers and it was the same...since then I kept an eye on these nipples and noticed that even within a few hours of use, it still collected lint and other things...... I regularly would boil the pacifiers and wash around the base of the nipple, but this isn't enough for these pacifiers...I am sending these nipples back to the company for my $$ back...don't buy these unless you are willing to constantly keep washing them within a few hours throughout the day..."
66838,1,This is a must for new moms who will be using a Medela pump! This kit made my life so much easier!
8980,0,I bought this product before in Target and thought these were exactly the same but they are not as good. They don't stick to the table as well as the ones I bought in target.
162124,2,"Before my daughter was born, a friend with a newborn told me to stay away from this tub. But I recieved it as a gift from a friend who never got the chance to use hers.I finally tried this tub yesterday with her. She is now 2 months old, we have been doing sponge baths up to this point- largely because I didn't want to try this tub. I decided it couldn't be all that bad so I took it out to give it a try.Just setting this thing up was a pain. I realized I had set it in the wrong direction for me to be comfortable, so when I tried to pick it up, it wouldn't move because of the suction cups. I emptied it, turned it around and tried to refill. Because of the design I had a hard time trying to fill it from the side with the toddler part.By the time I got her in this thing, I realized what part my friend had warned against. The mesh sling has a metal rod in the bottom, which would hurt to sit on! So I put a towel under her butt like my friend suggested. All was going well until she started sliding around and I tried to adjust her. The sling started moving and her face almost got covered under the water.Not safe at all. If you have this tub, absolutely do not leave your baby's side for any reason, don't even turn around to look at something else.Also, when I filled it up and went to get my daughter to put her in, alot of the water had already leaked out within about 2 minutes or so.Both my friend and I are are on our 4th child each. I have used other tubs, much simpler in design and very easy to use.I am going to go buy another one this week. I would not use this tub again."
88051,1,"I am so pleased with this bed set! Everything is just lovely! We haven't set up the room just yet, but I know it will be just beautiful. Everything that was shipped seems to be in EXCELLENT condition and I got it must faster than I expected. I emailed the seller several times with questions about the set and they responded as though we were instant messaging! I was very impressed with their professionalism and diligent. GREAT PRODUCT TOPPED WITH EVEN BETTER SERVICE. I'd rate this 7 out of 5 stars, but since the limit is only 5 I'll settle for that (LOL)."
173985,1,"I spent a lot of time looking at baby products. Overall this was the best looking swing I could find. It is wonderful. Fairly easy to put together. Runs on 4 D batteries, which it does seem to go through quickly. But as my friends say, my baby lives in her swing. It has two different swinging positions, both of which my baby likes. It has two seat positions. I tried the sitting up position with her at two and a half months and she she likes it, though she doesn't seem to sleep well that way. If nothing else makes her happy her swing will. This swing is wonderful and if I could give more than five stars I would. The controls are easy to use. It does not make any noise if set up right."
163927,1,I know that the recipient of this gift will love it. It is so adorable. A perfect gift for the new baby!
138096,1,"this is a great product. it gives off enough light to see the kids in the dark, but not enough to be obtrusive. now that it is staying light later into the evening, we aren't able to use it because it doesn't project enough light. that is okay with us. it will be a winter/fall night light."
151063,0,"What I like about this product is the ability to open it up and clean out the inside. It works well when you can get the opening, which is larger than other aspirators, into the baby's nose, but it's a challenge. The opening is designed to only go so far in though, an added safety benefit, but frustrating when there's a glob of snot beyond it's reach. I bought a little rubber aspirator on vacation and found it does the trick better than this product. Also, the casing and parts are bulky and take up a lot more space than the little rubber one, hence, me not bringing it on vacation."
70240,2,"This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out.Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well."
83304,1,"I love this changing pad! Its so cute and I get compliments everytime I use it. It folds easily, will hold 1-2 diapers and a small pack of wipes in the pocket. Very easy to clean. I use it in my diaper bag instead of the one that came with the bag. I've had miine for over a year and I highly recommend it."
19436,1,"The Snuzzler is one of the top baby products we own. It is now on my list of ""must haves"" for a new baby. Our son was barely 5 lbs when we brought him home, and the Snuzzler has supported him beautifully in his car seat, stroller, swing, bouncy seat, etc. I highly recommend this product even for larger infants because we continued to use this as he grew and grew due to the extra comfort it provides."
42279,0,"I purchased this sling based on all of the great reviews. It may be a great sling but I am not a fan based on the amount of fabric and the time it takes just to get the sling on. There is SO much fabric it was so cumbersome to get on, not to mention to try and carry around or put on quickly away from home."
38333,1,It fits perfectly in my sink and the baby is comfortable on the soft cushion. It is only good for a short time in the sink because eventually your baby grows too long for the cushion! I was still very pleased.
55634,1,"I bought these for my parents and for my baby's father for when I'm not around and so far it seems to work okay. If you put too much water in, it gets too hot, and my baby's father just puts the bottle in the freezer for a minute then gives it to the baby. Whatever you do, DO NOT touch the bottom of the inside if its been plugged in even for 5 seconds. I did that and OUCH it burnt me. The guide to how much water to put in per milk is VERY confusing I thought, so far we are just winging it based on what we think it says. The directions fail to mention what to even do with the water, so you have to measure it and I guess just pour it in the middle of the thing. I was very unsure about this at first, but I guess that's what you're supposed to do."
179625,2,THis version is the European version and does not fit with a britax marathon 70. Read everything before purchasing!! I couldn't find anywhere in the description that said this and didn't find out until we assembled it and realized the wheels did not work with our car seat. I like the concept but will have to find the right wheels! Maybe call amazOn to confirm before purchasing? They have good customer service.
37389,1,"We bought this to bring our own Baby Jogger City Mini Double stroller with us to Disneyland. I saw that the bag by Baby Jogger cost 4x as much, so decided to give this bag a try. The bag seemed well made and sturdy. I also liked that it has both the short handles and a long shoulder strap. Also has a small clear window with name tag. The stroller fits with the front wheels removed, which is super quick. The shape of the bag is more of a rectangle and our folded stroller is more of a square (hope this makes sense!) but it fit. Because the bag was long, there was plenty of extra room on the side to put the removed wheels and couple of jackets and blankies. I practically dragged it on the ground to gate check it and the bag was very strong. Even though it is not a padded bag, the heavy canvas material provides protection & contained the stroller well. Both the bag and the stroller made the trip with no damage whatsoever. Very happy with this bag and will use it again if we need to fly with our stroller. Two thumbs up!"
63707,0,"The cover only covers where the child sits. The child can easily pull up the cover on the sides and touch the cart underneath. Also, the child's legs are not protected from the cart. I will probably make modifications to it and use it again, but I would not recommend buying it."
40911,2,"These new diapers are HORRIBLE. They are leaky, thin, and absolutely cheap! They do NOT absorb as well! There is no absorbent liner in the back of the diaper for poops anymore!! When you compare the two side by side the difference is unbelievable! A lot less soft, thin and papery and cheap feeling! No mesh and only half a liner!!! I have heard all the excuses from Pampers as to ""Just go up a size"" or this is ""New technology"" or ""your problems are unexpected and rare"" It is absolute bull. Go to facebook group ""Pampers Bring Back The Old Cruisers"" and you will find all the information you could need about this serious downgrade! They have pictures and a lot of information. This was the hottest topic on Pampers website but they have conveniently gotten rid of links to the hottest forum on their main page. You can still find the forum listed under Pampers Village Forums\Pampers Website\Feedback Discussions\Pampers Low Blow. A total shame and now a poor excuse for a premium diaper."
68964,1,"This is the best deal you can find for this many diapers and this price. If you get the automatic subscription for it, then they cut you a deal on the price and free shipping. You should do it. You can space out the diapers to however often you want them to come. I love it. If you want to save money and aren't ready to do cloth diapers then you can start saving money by buying these from Amazon."
56828,0,"This just arrived. I haven't used it yet. This sounds silly, but I really wanted it as pictured. With the black 'basin' and white base. The entire thing is white. Wonder if other people experienced this also?? hmmmm"
150148,1,"My mother-in-law gave this to us when our son was about 6 months old. We used it with him, and our daughter years later (she's now two). We washed them in the dishwasher - they clean very easily as long as you take them apart. My kids never chewed through any of the sacks, but I did have extras just in case. I washed them regularly in the little baskets for baby bottles and other small miscellaneous kitchen items. These mesh feeding bags have been great for teething times, especially. Highly recommend them! Kathy, mom of two"
88260,0,"This product is a good idea, but the bag is too narrow."
35841,0,"I have to start by saying that I really love this item! It does the job-keeps my newborn nice and cozy, without having to bundle her up in a snowsuit everytime I leave the house! My only complaint is the zipper. I've had problems with it separating while it's still zipped up. Then, when I had it unzipped, the zipper pull completely broke off. I don't know if the company will help me out with this, but I'm going to contact them for suggestions. The winter is not over yet and I need at least a few more months use out of this!Other than that, I'm completely happy."
102368,0,"The three big leaves seem to slow down the rotation to the point of stopping movement all together even with brand new batteries. Ended up needing to fashion something to keep the leaves up high permanently so that the inside ring of animals would continue to rotate without stopping. My daughter does love it, though (as long as it doesn't stop on her)."
43682,1,"This is a handy little seat and very reasonable...it works great in the kitchen sink while the baby is an infant. It is nice that you don't have to fill up a big plastic tub, drain it and then find somewhere to put it. This folds up and dries quickly in your dish rack. It holds the baby upright for you while you wash and use the sprayer, it is not meant to use on mobile infants that are sitting up, I definitely would recommend this it was a life saver especially after a c-section....."
144643,0,"I will start by saying I used to love this highchair. This was before my son was so active (now 8mos) and before he was having so many solid food meals. Now my opinions of this chair have gone severly down hill.This chair is impossible to keep clean for the average mom. The dishwashable tray does not fit into the dishwasher (I have the dishwasher that they show the tray fitting into in there advertisements) the tray will not even fit into the dishwasher with nothing else in there, no baskets nothing. The base tray which would not be dishwasher safe even if it would fit has a seam all the way around it, which can only be cleaned with a toothpick, gets food in it at every meal and if your child is teething they will chew on the tray so this must be cleaned after or before every meal.My newest problem with this chair is that my son will not let me put the tray on once he is in the seat (it only slides on from the front so there is always at least one foot pushing against it) but I guess this is a good thing since it means I no longer have to clean the trays. : )As for the harness that I have never have had a problem with (I saw some one else complaining that it was too difficult, I think it is just fine. but I also have the Chicco stroller and car seat so maybe I just got used to them quicker)Oh and back to cleaning the seat cover of this chair is not meant to go in the washing machine so clean it right when the food gets on before it gets dried on. (I have a front loader washer and I have put it in on a quick rinse and spin it comes clean and still seems fine but who knows what i am doing to the insides that are not designed to be soaked?? Its just so much quicker then spot cleaning)Also the unit folds real easy but does not stand well when folded. When folded the unit does stand, but tips easily so only safe in area in between two items of furniture or walls.Positives :1 Before my son was using it to eat, it was a great ride for him because it was easy to wheel. Kept him calm at our meal times.2 Tray stores on the back of the legs.3 Latches are easy to get child in and out but not easy for child to open. The difficult portion of the latch is only there to remove the cover.4 If you care, it is a lot more attractive then most childrens items. Blends well with house depending on the pattern you choose.I will guess this chair may be right for some people but it turns out it is not right for us, so I am looking to find a new one (I really hate to spend the money but I just don't think I can make it much longer with this one) In hindsight I should have payed more attention to the reviews I read before I chose this one most of the negatives were correct. : (This is my revised review so it would not let me change the star rating I would not give this product more then 2 stars at this time."
73965,1,"I just recieved my Joovy and after putting it together myself with no help from hubby I tested it out with my 2 and 4 year old girls. They absolutely loved it! I love it as well it is light and very easy to push them both, easy to stear. I am fine with the basket placement and size. I do wish it had a cupholder but I just plan on ordering one.I bought the apple green and the color is very nice!We do a lot of zoo, seaworld, airshow type outings and this will be perfect because although my oldest is 4 she still needs to hitch a ride once in a while even on the many walks we take.I think that bad reviews on here are people just being way too picky it really is a wonderful product!!!!"
92297,1,"Well made, great for breastfed babies, and our recommendation to new parents. Remember, of course, your infant will always have an opinion so buy one to try it out before investing in a large set. :)"
94523,2,These bottles are horrible! They leak no matter how much or little you tighten the ring.
14227,2,"Avent is not a good product. The bottles do not prevent baby from getting too much air in their tummies. One thing I really hated about these bottles is that they leaked! When I would go to shake up the bottle, I would get formula everywhere. So, I would unscrew the nipple and tighten it again. Same thing. I'm sorry, but I expect bottles not to leak when I pay almost 5 dollars a bottle. This product is a gimmick!"
38664,1,"Love, love, love this product! My son grew out of his &quot;Four Stage Bath System&quot; (actually never found all four stages) around 4 months old. His little feet kept getting stuck under the plastic ridge in front, so when I found the Safer Bather (no plastic) I was so excited! He sits so comfortably in the little &quot;nest&quot; in the warm water while I use BOTH hands to wash him. There is no fear of his little head sliding under the water because the water is nestled in the middle of the cushion. I recommend this product to anybody whose little one is 4+ months. In fact, I am going to buy another one so I can have it in storage for my next baby."
27186,2,"I purchased the letter ""b"" but when I received the package, the ribbon was stapled on upside-down making the letter look like a ""p"". It looks great other than it being upside down. Because of the price, it is not worth sending back and waiting on another one. It would be less hassle to just fix it myself. This is a great product, but I suggest buying it in a store (I think Babies 'R Us sells them) to avoid receiving the wrong letter."
126319,1,"I buy this item for my 7 month old baby grandson. It is so convenient to have his diapers shipped to the house and you never run out. They are priced right, free shipping and you never have to think about buying diapers again. You are notified before they are shipped and you can make changes on your order if needed. The product speaks for itself. Comfortable fit for any baby in any size. This the second grandson I have ordered diapers for as a gift for my daughter. Love this idea of home delivery and of course the savings."
116087,1,"This is a great new high chair. It is easy to clean, easy to put together and comfortable for my 8 month old. It is not good for new eaters (4-6 months) because it is not real padded and does not recline, but for older babies it is great!"
21477,0,"I first bought a few of these diapers from a one-sale-a-day site, they had discontinued some of the colors. I used them for a while, really liked them, so ordered a lot more. They are big on a newborn, but my little guy grew into them. He is now 10 months old, around 18 pounds, and they fit him well. I am still folding the front down, so there's room to grow. So I was happy with these diapers for many months. They are absorbent, hold in messes, and wash up well.After a little while, I started noticing velcro problems. On some of the diapers (the newer ones that I ordered last), the fuzzy velcro strip on the outside of the diaper will curl up longways when out of the wash. Not a huge deal, but makes it a little harder to maneuver on a wiggly baby. But worse is the fact that, on most of the diapers, the velcro square started detaching off the tab. I sewed many down by hand before I realized that the velcro tab itself is degrading, making the velcro ""hooks"" disappear. This is only happening on the hooked velcro on the left side of the baby.Yet another problem is that some of the diapers leak. I always have the extra insert in, but I'm noticing leaks around the legs, even when the back half of the diaper is perfectly dry. Stripping them does not seem to help. I wonder if the stitching has caused leakage through the PUL layer, although other brands of diapers are stitched the same way and don't have the same problems."
15072,0,"I used the installation kit so I wouldn't have to drill holes in my the post of my stair rail. You can buy everything that comes in the kit at your local hardware store, but if you don't feel like wasting the time to go shop for the different pieces, then the kit is an easy solution."
51232,1,"It was for my pregnant girlfriend, but as soon as I found out how comfy it was, I pushed her off the bed, far away from ever coming between me and my snoogle. I'm going to pay a fortune in child support, but at least I'm sleeping like a baby!"
71066,2,"Just a word of warning. I ordered this item and today it was left on my door in completley battered condition. While this may sound like a UPS issue, the bottom line is Babies R Us was responsible for preparing the package and said package had no outer boxing, meaning it was pulled from the shelf, a label was stuck on it and it was left to the mercy of UPS. The box had obviously been opened and taped shut, in a very poor manner, at least once. To ship any package in the same form you would pull it off the shelf at a store is pathetically irresponsible and unacceptable. I've arranged for a refund and pick up from UPS to send it back and will just get the item wherever I can find it and put it in the car. I wouldn't third party order anything from Babies R Us again and Amazon (who I've ordered probably hundereds of various items from) was made to look bad by representing them. Shame shame shame."
45307,1,"Bought this item for my new grandson. We put him on the mat at 6 weeks old and he came alive! SO Many things to look at. Nice grommets so you can change toys. Easy to pack, easy to wash."
90478,1,"These have worked very well for my daughter, for the most part these keep her dry. When I have had trouble is on occasion she will be a little wet in the mornings, though I must take into account that this means going w/ the 1 diaper from 7p-7a w/o changing. They do claim to keep baby dry for 12-13 hrs though. I take very meticulous care to place the diaper very well, so that there are the least chances of any leakage too. Despite these occasional accidents, I am having another baby soon & will likely be using Pampers as my choice of diaper."
143703,1,"This is a great sheet, neutral color, extremely comfortable for my baby to sleep on. It also washes nicely. I definitely recommend this item, its a classic."
31430,1,"This drying rack is very good size, I use it every day to dry the bottles, pacifiers and parts from my pump. For those who wonder if you really need it or not - it's useful and I'm glad I got it."
125191,2,"Hey? Is your kid not drooling enough? Is he being teased and the park because he doesn't have a big drool stain down his shirt? Then this is for you! This just seemed to get every ounce of drool out of his mouth and on to everything within a throwing distance. He'd load up the drool launcher and fling it all over. All in all, pretty gross! In reality, I wouldn't mind drool everywhere if it helped with the teeth. It didn't. He still seemed upset and ouchy, and now wet! And it didn't seem very interesting either... He'd have it in his mouth a minute tops and then it'd get thrown somewhere. Not worth the effort."
175675,0,"This product is a great idea. However, it has two problems. First of all, my twins liked their whole body to be swaddled--arms and legs--and not just their arms. This did not allow me to swaddle their legs. Secondly, the sleep sack right around the neck bunched up on both my boys causing a potential SIDS risk."
16717,1,"...i have learned to love it, because my daughter loves it so much! the music always captures and holds her attention, and when i call grandmom's house to check on her, i'm always told about how much fun she's having with &quot;starman&quot;, one of the soft hanging toys. she also likes to stare at the included blanket mat draped over the side of the couch. my only complaint? it's loud. really loud. i wish i could turn it down. instead, we've wrapped a receiving blanket over the speaker to muffle it a little."
125956,1,I use huggies for my 3 month old daughter. I tried other brands but they just didn't fit right. Huggies is the only one with the stretch waist and they are the only kind that will fit around her chubby legs. I've tried Luvs and Pampers but didn't even finish the package before I switched back to my HUGGIES! Sometimes when she sleeps for a long time (12 hours) they leak a little but I change her clothes in the morning anyway so its not a problem for me. I LOVE huggies!
123957,1,"When we found out we were having triplets, we like all other multiple parents bought a stroller to accommodate all the babies. The stroller is so large that we can not even fit it into a mini van. We have to purchase a large SUV or Full size van to go anywhere.We bought the Latch Lock carriers from baby trend and we just love them. When we saw the stroller that went along with them. We decided to order the Double Snap N Go.The stroller comes all put together, you just need to snap on the wheels. Then comes the fun part. The stroller is made for many different brands of carriers. You find the carrier you are using in the instruction manual and then you remove bars or rearrange them to fit your carrier. It is very simple and all the parts are well labeled.The carriers just snap on to the top, just like when you snap them into the base that is in the car. There is a strap that goes over the lower half of the carrier to prevent it from rocking or coming off the stroller. It is great because you do not have to unsnap your baby from the car seat and them snap them into the stroller. No need to transfer toys and blankets from car seat to stroller. What a time saver.It is very light weight and easy to set up. I pull it out of the trunk and just snap and lock it into place. I then just snap the carriers in place and we are off. It takes up the same amount of room that a normal single travel system would take up.For all you shoppers out there. I took the stroller into a women's clothing store and was able to easily navigate the store. The stroller handles very well. The front wheels are adjustable. You can set them for straight ahead or let them rotate.Because we have 3 babies, we easily become a tourist attraction. The stroller handles so well that I was able to move swiftly and accurately through spectators and display racks.We love the Double Snap N Go so much that we have asked for the Single Snap N Go for our Baby Shower."
160708,0,"The concept of this sheet is great, however the quality and fit is not. It contained messes and saved me the trouble of changing the crib sheet every so often. It lost its fit after just one wash and started to pill after a couple. Also couple of snaps broke off in the washing machine :( Not sure if i'll buy it again even though the price has gone down considerably ( got it for $18 6 months back)."
121487,1,This pail is great. We don't use a deodorizer except for some baking soda in the bottom of the pail. The lid keeps the odors in. We love 'em.
104793,2,"We bought two of these for our newborn twins because they were able to sit side by side in our van. The width of these seats made them perfect for our car, everything else was a nightmare. The foam behind the seats in both seats cracked and broke off in chucks. It is a piece of junk. I took the first seat back as soon as the foam cracked. Fortunately we live near where they are made. They did give me a new seat. It cracked in a week. But the worst and most unforgiveable things was the tether that locks the carseat in place. It is extrememly long. We took the seats on an airplane trip and when we got to our destination we put the seats in the car. We did not lock in the tether because there was no place on that particular car for the tether to go. Unfortunately the tether had come loose during the flight and was no longer rolled up in the back of the seat. The tether was so long it actually went from the middle seat and unbeknownst to me was hanging out of the door when we drove off. It then got caught under the wheel of the car smashing the middle baby seat into the other. We spent the morning at the ER with our two babies and one now has a permanent scar on his ankle from this accident. I went into Target to check out the tether lengths on the other seat brands. We realize that this was a crazy accident. But the length of the other tethers is about half that of the Sunshines. It's not something you think about until the worst happens, but as a car seat manufacturer they ought to consider these things. Why should their tether be so much longer then everyone elses? Also the seats are very heavy. We purchased the travel carrying covers for them (supposedly makes them easier to travel with in airports). Both carrying straps broke withing 20 minutes of trying to lug those heavy carseats around. A piece of junk. Sunshine - you should be ashamed of yourselves."
44869,1,"My son is just about 8 months old now and I figured I would jump online and start reviewing some of the products I have used. When I was pregnant, I found the reviews helpful, so I thought I would add to the feedback....Although I have not tried the more up-to-date pumps, I bought this one because it was more affordable and it has worked just fine for me. I have not had to replace any of the attachments, they have all held up just fine and at 8 months.... its still doing just fine. I'm hoping it will last me for my 2nd baby, seems like it will make it!! Good quality for the price."
44179,2,"Okay, first, this thing looks a million times cooler than those duck ones. I was really excited about a functional item that looked cool too, but I was disappointed. I expected the design to be more evolved- there are a few major flaws. My 10 month old son can (and does) easily pull this off the faucet. When he does that, the door to the bubble dispenser pops open and all of the soap comes out. Additionally, the bubble dispenser door pops off easily (choking hazard?) I wouldn't buy a duck, but I am pretty disappointed with this product."
111939,2,"I hate this gate and quality is typical of evenflo. If I had noticed it was evenflo, I wouuld not have wasted my time. It was a pain to install. Total PAIN. Then, when it's unlocked, it slides for adjustment. The thing is, there is no way to stop it so baby sticks his arm through slates as you open and then you have a broken or badly bruised arm. We put a screw into the wood so it would slide just a little to help prevent that. IF we had known about the second risk, we would have just taken it down then. THe next morning, it was kid tested. Yeah, all the kid has to do is push the bottom and it comes out of the bracket causing the gate bend foreward. So far, I have seen my kids push it more than a foot out of position. MAJOR STRANGLATION HAZARD. Not to mention broken bones. The wood is so flimsy it just twist every which way.As far as function goes, when you go to unlock it, sometimes it will not unhook out of the slot. I have had to pratically hang on it to get it open. Also, the gate now leans. When opened, it leans to where a ball would roll for the from to the end of the gate. Not sure how that came about. We have had this gate for a couple of months. My son has been able to push it out since he started crawling. My 2 yrold can almost squeeze out by pushing on it which has lead to her getting stuck when I made a bathroom break. Not a good gate at all. Evenflo just needs to stop. Every product I have had has been crap. I am afraid to buy their carseats. If they can't make a good simple baby gate, I wouldn't trust my child's life to their carseats. We plan to replace within the next couple of paychecks."
148079,1,"We absolutely love this bouncer because our baby girl loves it. She smiles whenever we put her in it and gets so excited to be playing in it! She is 12 weeks today and for about the first 8 weeks she wasn't interested in the bouncer at all, but about 4 weeks ago we tried it again and now it is her favorite toy. I can put her in it and she entertains herself for quite a while so that I can get other things done around the house, eat, or go to the bathroom without her crying. When she gets overstimulated and doesn't want to look at the toy bar anymore, we take it off and she likes to just hang out in the seat with the vibration turned on. This bouncer is really a lifesaver for anyone with a young baby!"
95143,1,"solicite el pedido me llego en el tiempo exacto, el producto me ha salido muy bueno"
28879,1,"Very easy to assamble, it functions smoothly and doesn't make a sound. Very confortable and well made."
145001,1,This stroller is so easy to push. I can get around isles--even a busy lunchroom--with ease. It's also simple to handle. It's really nice!
137696,1,"Very good quality, great finish, it's just as shown in the image and as stated in the specifications. I highly recommend it."
78699,1,"When I first considered purchasing this product, I was very skeptical! I have a 9 month old baby girl and traveling with her is a nightmare...her diaper bag, a carry on piece of luggage, her car seat and of course, her! It was all so much to handle! So, after reading the reviews, I decided to take the chance and spend the $15. I got the product and was unimpressed with the look of it, it's a small nylon ""t"" strap with D rings on each end. Like many reviews noted, it isn't really worth $15 however it's a better deal than a $200 travel car seat and seemed more effective. Well, I had the chance to use it and what can I say...it was a lifesaver! I have a safety 1st car seat and a nice piece of luggage (can't remember the name). It was a tight fit on the luggage which is a good thing because it can't slide around. I put her diaper bag around the handle of the luggage and literally carried NOTHING! It does take some practice to hook and unhook it from the luggage however after some practice runs it worked just fine. We received so many comments from people around the airport, it was kinda fun! My daughter didn't seem to mind being in it, she didn't seem to care one way or another. I would purchase this again and again!"
59243,1,This express bottle warmer saved us from spending more time heating up the baby's bottle. Thank you!
64149,1,Our 6 month old loves this teether. It is the only teething ring he would use. He refused all others.The size and slim profile is perfect for little hands. He wraps his fingers around the ring and slips his thumb through the hole.There are 3 different textures on the yellow nubbies.The colors are cheerful and it's easy to clean.
184495,1,"This seat works WONDERFULLY!!! I hate the idea of my baby chewing on the bars of shopping carts, and he is way to young to have the concept of ""no"". This covers the bar, so I know that at least what he is chewing on is clean. It also has the strap and padded seat to keep him securely up right and comfortable. It is a little bulky to carry around with you, but if you are going from car to cart (or right into a restaurant for use in a high chair) it works wonderfully. It is worth buying and keeping in your car at all times!"
48643,1,"Let me start by saying this is my second stroller. This is an ""umbrella stroller"" so be aware this is it not great for walking with long strides or putting very much in the basket. I do not think I would be happy with this as my only stroller.I love this stroller for leaving it in my small SUV. It doesn't get in the way. I have even placed it on top of my groceries because it is so light. It is the perfect size for travel, going into stores, garage sales, garden centers, church, using public transportation, etc. However, I still use my full-size Graco stroller for anything where I need to walk alot such as going to the mall or taking a walk in my neighborhood."
12821,2,"Save your money for other things you will need once the baby has arrived! Until then wait until your next appointment with your doctor and you will be able to hear the heartbeat at the Doctor's office. Don't worry yourself silly trying to find the baby's heartbeat with this. like I did...I was however able to play music for the baby in utero, which is why it did receive 1 star. Something that I could have accomplished however with my husbands portable cd player."
183145,0,"We use one of these bags at home, but beware they are not totally waterproof. When wet cloth diapers are stored in these, they will leak through the woven fabric. I have to keep mine stored on top of the washing machine until I do laundry so the floor under the bag does not get wet. I would not recommend traveling with this bag unless you have a way to keep everything else around it dry. I do like that this bag can be thrown in the wash with the dirty diapers though."
131166,0,I purchased this mainly just to wear for short periods of time....when I am taking the dog outside or waiting out at the bus stop in the morning with our older daughter..It works GREAT for those occasions. It is even nice to wear around the house sometimes to get a few chores done when baby is in a cuddly mood. I definately wouldn't recommend this for wear for long periods of time unless your baby is still small. Our daughter has almost outgrown it (weight limit is 20 pounds for this model)She is almost 17 pounds at 4 months and after about 20 mins of carrying her in the carrier it starts to get at your back - even with the straps adjusted correctly. I think it's just because she is getting bigger because it was always really comfortable until now. I still would recommend this product because it is a great deal if you are just looking for a basic carrier. :-)
63338,1,"My Son, who is 7 months old now really likes this pond. He can push on the soft parts of the sunshine and he slaps both of his hands against the water to make the fish move around inside. It is a nice size, it doesn't take up a lot of room. Perfect toy to take along to the sitters' also.I would recommend this toy."
118576,2,"I am VERY disappointed with this product. It worked the first two times I tried it, with an apple and a pear. I tried it again this morning with an apple and couldn't get it to grate the apple at all. I think the blade has dulled... Anyway, I am thoroughly unimpressed and will be returning it."
93622,0,"I bought this because I thought the ""reward noises"" were such a cute idea. But there are two main problems with this potty. First, it leaks for boys. Every single time my 2 year old goes on it, there is a puddle underneath on the floor, and that doesn't happen with other potties. The second issue is that my son really doesn't care about the ""reward noises"" and therefore there is a lot of pomp and circumstance with this potty that is unecessary. Not to mention the need to add batteries frequently. I would suggest going with a much simpler design potty and coming up with your own reward system."
39610,0,"We switched to sleep sacks from swaddles at about 5.5 months. My son is now 7 months old so we've been using this for about 6 weeks. While the sack works as it is supposed to, it just seems cheap for $20-$25. The fleece is already quite pilled after being washed about once a week for the last 6 weeks. If you look at the inside of the sack it just appears to be a pretty low-quality fleece. I don't mind the zipper like some of the other reviews do. It's easy on and off. I like the safety aspect of using a sack instead of blankets. My son stays nice and warm when in this paired with a long-sleeved sleeper.Another thing that I feel like should be a consideration is the child's mobility in the sack. When we first switched to the sleep sack, my son had recently started rolling. I think the sack inhibited his rolling at night and sometimes made him frustrated and he would cry until someone rescued him from his position (usually stuck on his tummy). He does fine with it now that he's much more proficient at moving however he wishes.I just can't recommend something that is such a bad value. I can't imagine what the profit margin is for these. You can get nice fleece for $4 a yard (this is not a yard of fabric and I'm sure Halo doesn't spend $4 a yard on the thousands of yards that they purchase) and then throw in a zipper for another $1. They are making a killing on these things."
126805,1,"My baby boy kept peeing through EVERY diaper and I was at my wits end, until I discovered the Snug and Dry!! He has not had any pee-throughs since and I LOVE THEM! The issue was only at night but I am glad I made the switch - and with subscribe and save through amazon, you won't find a better price!"
107061,1,"PRO'S1. Doesn't take up too much space2. Very easy to use.3. Very easy to empty.4. Can use regular trash bags (saves money!)CON'S1. There is a slight smell when my son delivers a REALLY stinky muddy diaper. (other than that there is no smell. I just throw the ""bombers"" in the trash outside.FYI1. Don't let it get too full, otherwise it is hard to pull the trash bags out to empty. And once it is open (stinky!!!) you don't want to waste any time getting the full bag out of the house.UPDATE: Our son is now 9.5 months old and it just stinks. No matter if there is a diaper in there or not. We have cleaned it, sprayed it, bleached it, put dryer sheets in it, well you name it and we have tried it. THE THING STINKS!!! We have since tried other bags and such but if you walk in my sons room you smell the diaper champ. It is going out I am sad to say. But we did get several smell free months out of it. Also just a note. My son started eating solid food and went to formula when it started stinking real bad!"
170741,0,The sheet is made from very thin fabric. I was expecting something of higher quality that would be softer on baby's skin.
171996,1,"My third child was born 8 weeks premature. He hated his sponge baths. He came home from the hospital after just 2.5 weeks in the hospital. I didn't get this tub until he was 6 weeks old. He loves it. Before we got this, we were bathing him in the sink and he slipped all over the place. It took two of us to give him a bath. Now I put him in the sling and I don't have to worry about him slipping out of my hands. I LOVE THIS TUB!"
140105,1,What a beautiful gate. Well worth the money. Easy to assemble. A nice addition to the decor of your home. Not like those cheap flimsy gates that I have bought in the past.I have two of these gates now.
94104,1,"This blanket is sooo soft. My baby loves to snuggle with it. Be advised though, that one sided is full satin. Would have been nice to have the fuzzy fabric on both sides and just the satin on the edges. Washes well, just be sure not to wash it with any bibs or the bibs will snag it."
150744,2,The battery powered pump slowly dribbles water out with very little pressure. My baby has a lot of hair and after 3 minutes of trying to rinse out the shampoo we have abandoned it in favour of a water jug. At 3am last night I stubbed my toe on it as I went to the bathroom in the dark. I cannot fully describe my anger at this piece of junk.
17072,1,"This is the absolute must-have for any new parent. I'm about to buy my second for baby number two so that each child can have one! The picture is in black/white, but for the price you cannot beat the reception. I'm not sure why people would have problems with this...perhaps it has to do w/location. We're in a big city and have never had a problem with it. It's the best $100 I've ever spent...hands down!"
139205,1,"... it could be improved with a feature to allow the light to remain on continuously and/or have the button you use to turn the night light on be backlit to make it easier to find in the dark. I would be happy to replace (or recharge) batteries, and it would be nice to have the option to keep the light on instead of being beholden to the 45-minute preset timer. While I can find the button easily in the dark it can be a challenge for my 3-year-old, thus it would be nice if the button were backlit. These are simply improvements I would like to see, and, overall, the light is great and I would definitely recommend it.This is such a cute night light, love the projected stars (it's fun seeking out the constellations), and the amount of light it gives off is perfect."
84576,0,"I had my baby 3 weeks ago, by c-section so i'm not too sure about my milk supply.But i can pump 2 oz. in 15 minutes and it's annoying cause i don't know if that's good or bad.their are times when milk gets stuck in the filter part and one day i tryed to make it go into the bottle and milk went all over my clothes!If you have a good milk supply this pump is for you, if not this pump will test your patience!"
100326,0,"We switched to Pampers from Huggies because we were having some leakage issues. While these diapers seem to absorb the pee very well, we've already had several instances of ""escaped poo"". Also, these don't have the wetness indicator, which we liked."
64236,1,"We purchased this stroller after researching all the different brands out there...and there is a lot to choose from!!! What I really love about this stroller is that it feels sturdy and the seat is nice and padded and not flimsy material. It has a very smooth ride as well. I love the parent cup holders and that the baby has a tray as well. Many of the 3-wheeled strollers do not offer these features. This stroller does turn on a dime and is easy to fold. The basket is large and easy to reach as well. No complaints with that...The cons are: you can't have a baby face you unless the baby is in a car seat (I haven't tried a car seat yet...we are getting the Graco Safe Seat and it's a little bigger than the snug ride so I hope it fits ok). We did get the cayanne and the color looked a bit faded coming out of the box. The wheels do loose air and have to be pumped up every few days or so. I heard you can call the company and they will replace the tires if they leak a lot so I may call them. The most worthless part is the break. I can't get the break to work for the life of me by stepping on it. The directions say you have to push down with ""significant force."" However, I can't push down any harder without totally ruining the stroller. My partner can get the brake to engage by pusing down with both hands but not her feet....Plus, when the brake support legs come down they don't even touch the ground and we can't get them adjusted enough to reach the ground. So the break system for us is completely worthless and we would like to actually remove those extra little legs since they sort of bounce around when you are pushing the stroller around. One more con is that the child cup holder is so small that none of our bottles fit into the little hole. I guess we could put snacks in it. But all the standard bottles I have are too large. That's ok...she would throw it out anyway...So, besides the totally worthless brake system, we really do love this stroller. The baby is comfortable in it, it rides very smooth and it does look sharp. There is extra padding which I haven't found on most strollers and I love the extra pockets in the back to put baby or mommy things. The parent try is great too and very easy to remove if you don't want it.I hope this review helps!"
45400,1,My son has loved his mat since he was born...he is 3 months old now and every week he loves it even more.I love the music and the different animals that have different rattles and sounds.Get this mat! Your child will love it.
62179,2,"After my second son was born I was using the same pump (Ameda) that the hospital gave me and when I couldn't get it to work for a couple of days I went out and bought this pump thinking that it would be more sturdy. I never really did get it to have very good suction and should have called within a day or two to get a refund but I decided to try and stick it out, which was a BIG mistake. A piece of the plastic that holds the handle down in the front broke. About a week later all I could get was what my body naturally let down. I called customer service and told them that I couldn't get any good suction and was told that this pump was for massaging the breast and helping with let down and wasn't suppose to have a good suction for extraction. I thought Gerber would have a better product, but obviously not. I am so mad at myself for buying this useless pump. I ended up fiddling with my old pump and getting it to work again. I've thought of buying another pump but am scared I'll buy another lemon."
37602,0,"I purchased the Pampers Sensitive baby wipes to try out with our twin toddlers. We had been using Huggies wipes and thought with the great price for these Pampers wipes, here on Amazon, we would give those a try.The Pampers are a good product, but more so for a baby. Though I LOVED how each wipe popped out individually and were not connected to each other. They just are not thick enough to handle the messiness of my toddler boys. I would however recommend them to anyone with an infant."
140643,0,"My daughter absolutely loves this mobile, especially the octopus that spins while the moblie goes around. She could watch it for hours! The only thing I don't like about it is that it just doesn't play long enough. I feel like I spend more time winding it up than watching my daughter enjoy it."
25575,1,"I was actually given this jogging stroller as a gift. I have used this stroller somewhat for my 6 month old son. He may be a little young for it, as the straps are not so secure but I use this for walks around the neighborhood. This stroller manuevers over sidewalks very easy, the big wheels make the ride very smooth compared to a regular stroller.Its very easy to fold up and put in the car. It takes up half the space as a regular stroller when folded up."
90218,0,"I am disappointed with the change they made to this product. Like some moms said, it was a really good product for the price they offered. it had all the benefits, even the elastic waist band."
48048,1,"Like many buyers out there I was looking for CAMO First. After receiving the seat from compass I was very pleasantly suprised at the quality of the seat. It has much more padding and support and when the boys fall asleep in them they can rest their head against the larger padded sides. Other seats that we have do not have the padding or comfort that these seats provide. Also, the way the strap is threaded through the seat it hits the boys in a comfortable position, they love them and so does Dad."
84230,1,"Since Britax has discontinued it's Companion line, this may not be all that useful for many people, but we were almost turned away from buying this stroller because we kept reading reviews that it would only take Baby Trend car seats. The key if you try it out with your infant carrier in a department store is to tip down the tray (press the red buttons on each side). You can put the infant carrier in the front or the back (or two carriers if you have twins).We went with this one for two reasons:1) We have a 15 month old who is too young for the sit and stand yet, but will be able to use that feature later.2) This one was the only affordable stroller that would take our infant carrier (without an adapter, I would add)"
142508,1,"I'm very happy with this mat, even though it was pricey. It is one of the few PVC-free mats I could find. The best thing about it is that you can throw it in the washing machine. It does come out a little wrinkly (I line dry it) but it lays down nice and flat without curling at the edges. It is plasticized so it's easy to wipe off, yet it's heavy enough that it doesn't slip around. I wish they made a smaller one because I would also recommend this for taking to restaurants to avoid having your server hate you for creating a mess. I guess you could just cut a big one in half."
164908,2,"We found this diaper undependable. Leaky and can't take an average load (liquid or solid). Difficult to manage the night shift, when his clothes and the sheets get wet.Prefer swaddlers any day."
76475,2,"We used this during my baby's first few days home, and haven't used it since. It seems like he would slide down, even with the foam sides in place. Now that my baby is 3 weeks old, he likes to sleep with his arms above his head and the foam sides seemed to block him from getting into that comfortable position."
175946,1,"I love this carrier/sling. Just got it a couple days ago and tested it right away by putting my 2 month old preemie in it. He loved it and fell asleep immeditely. He loves being close to the chest so this is wonderful. Not too complicated to use, but I will surely save the instructions for all the different ways to wear the carrier. very happy with this purchase...and it may just be the new gift I give to all new Moms!"
129901,1,"Graco ComfortSport Convertible Car Seat in MarcusI bought an additional car seat base for our grandson's new baby and it really makes it convient having the base in two vehicles already strapped in so as all my granddaughter has to do is snap the seat into the base and off they go, safe and sound."
118190,2,"This product LOOKS very practical, but it is SOOOO not. The milk leaks out when the container is heated either from the adaptor or from the nipple attachment. I contacted avent about this problem and it turns out you are not supposed to use the same nipples for the nurser that you use for the avent bottles because they don't fit. Who has time to go thru nipples and separate them out when they look EXACTLY the same. Waste of money if you ask me. Stick with the bottles for storing milk, they worked much better for me."
76162,2,"I received these trays as a gift. Love that they are bpa free and come with lids, however, each cube holds only 1/2 oz to 2/3 oz breastmilk (not 1 oz as stated online and on the product packaging). As thawed breastmilk is only good for 24 hours in the fridge, this makes planning more difficult and can lead to wasted ""liquid gold"". Will not be using for breastmilk storage"
30245,0,"Don't fool yourself into thinking that Potty Monkey will solve your child's potty training needs. I was fooled and now have a mini toilet while my daughter has a new stuffed monkey she carries around the house. Every time she makes the monkey talk I feel he is mocking me for my purchase. I'm kind of surprised how small the toilet is. Not even close to the same dimensions of the monkey so it's tough to keep him pinned on the seat. Anyway, a word to the wise: If your child is very interested in potty training, then this could push them over the hump. Otherwise, you're just buying another stuffed toy... and a miniature toilet. :("
23594,1,"My daughter is 6 months old and still a bit small for it. The chair itself is pretty deep probably more well suited for an older child. I like the release grips on the handles, they make for easy removal from the table. I recommend tightening the red knobs by the release grips for a more secure fit. I did not read the instructions and therefore was unaware of that feature until I started to investigate a little wobbliness. The rubber arms are a nice feature, no scratches on the table yet! So far the chair seems pretty sturdy. I wanted to try to use it while out to eat but it seems rather bulky to lug around. I might think about packing it while on a vacation though. It definitely saves space for us in our apt where we don't have much room for a free standing high chair. I have had this item for a month and have not had any problems so far. There was only one place on my table where it wouldn't fit because of a deep inset lip on the underside."
162011,2,"I rec'd this tub as a shower gift. It seemed like a nice idea--collapsible, sleeve for bathing a newborn, and the ring which would aid in helping an older baby sit. The troubles began as soon as we took it out of the package--trying to get it to click together and lock took both my husband and myself pulling and pushing on it. Once locked, we didn't want to unlock it for fear of it not locking in place again, so we were never able to collapse it for easy storage. The sleeve worked ok, but we always needed to make sure the water level was low because wet babies slide down it very easily. Once our son could sit up, we used the ring but had to wrap a washcloth around the support pole and the top of the ring because it would chafe his belly if he leaned against it. To top it all off, it leaked from the bottom of the tub where the seal is...not every time we used it, but enough to get very tired of it. We moved our son to the big bathtub as soon as we could safely get away with it."
183031,1,"This is a great little umbrella stroller.Pros:*removable and adjustable canopy hood*great colors - mine is black w/red detail (I got it from Toys R Us, Babies R Us just has black w/yellow detail*great storage saddle bags*steers great w/ easy manueverability*handles are taller than most umbrella strollers*handles are covers in foam so they are more comfortableCons:*the old umbrella stroller that was navy and yellow reclined, wish this one did too*the seat needs to be a little bit bigger"
71776,1,"Our son is potty training and will not yet go on a big toilet, so needless to say- we needed a travel potty! I have nothing negative at all to say about this product. It's super convenient and easy to quickly pop up and use. The carrying bag is awesome and more than 1/2 the reason I bought it. I can sling it over my shoulder, throw in my keys, phone etc. and no one knows there's a potty in there. Highly recommend."
29687,1,"I love this diaper bag because its appearance is attractive and it's big enough to carry everything I need for my baby. The main compartment is very roomy, and it contains a nice removable plastic pocket in which I store small toiletries. I find the mesh pocket on the outside (on the short side) very handy for storing my cellular phone. The attached changing pad was useful for a few months. In order to use it, I had to put the bag on the floor, but that didn't bother me. My son is six and a half months old, and I haven't had any problems with the bag's durability."
166990,1,I am odering a new set of these spoons for the 21-month old boy I nanny. He is wanting to feed himself and these spoons are great. Some of the 'toddler' spoons have such a big bowl it can be hard to get all the spoon in the mouth for beginners. The size of these spoons are perfect for him to use and they are kind to teething gums. He has used these spoons from his first solids and loves them!
180436,1,"I bought this for my husband but after trying several different diaper bags I took it over. It was especially great while traveling. At some point functionality takes over style. This has easy to wear with the baby and carry everything else. It has easy access pockets so you can get to what you need quickly. Really, other than the look (for girly moms) it has everything a diaper bag should."
3293,1,"Great for quick swaddling, especially at night when you just want to get back to bed and haven't got time to spread out the swaddle blanket on the floor and re-do it when you get it wrong.Baby looks very cute in it too!"
160200,1,"I absolutely love this product! My daughter is a very restless sleeper (9 weeks old) and tends to smack herself in the face, which of course wakes her up, unless her hands are swaddled down. I've tried blankets of all kinds, but she's always managed to get herself out of them. This product is great in that the microfleece is strong enough to keep her from unswaddling herself, while also being breathable. She sleeps so great in it that ever since I've used it (at about 6 weeks of age) she's slept through the night anywhere from 5 - 7 hours without waking me up for milk. I highly recommend this product!"
93269,1,"We bought this cot for our 3.5 yr old son for a camping trip. I was concerned that it would be too short, but it is perfect for him. It is fast and easy to set up, and packs small. He slept great on it, even through winter storms! The only reason I give it four stars is because the toggle on the carry case broke the very first time we used it. This certainly doesn't effect the function of the cot, though."
49851,0,I bought this because my 2 year old son kept opening up my refrigerator. It went on perfectly and worked good for the first day. He learned how to unlatch it after the second day and took about 1 1/2 weeks before he decided to swing the door open hard enough to break it from the door. I don't totally blame it on the plastic durability but more so the sticky tape that is supposed to hold it in place on your refrigerator door.
68285,1,"I ordered this because I have extremely dry skin in the wintertime. After just a couple days of using this on my legs, the transformation was wonderful. I continue to use it every couple days on the spots that were problems, just to keep them soft and healed. I wish Amazon would get more in cause I would order more with my free shipping. I love this stuff. I would imagine it would work very well for burns, etc. Most anything that needs healing. It is gentle but wow, does it work!"
172639,2,"I bought the tub because I thought the shower idea was great! I always rinse my baby with fresh water from a small plastic cup at the end of the bath anyway and thought that this would be a more efficient and easier way. But, it is not easier or efficient. First, the stream that comes out of the shower is very weak, therefore, it takes longer to rinse my baby. And it is not easier because the button to turn on the shower requires very firm, constant pressure with your finger, which after a few seconds, you'll feel your finger go numb and weak before the baby is even rinsed off! The button is also located in a bad position where your hand ends up covering some of the already weak stream of water from the shower. Then, when your finger gets wet from washing the baby, pushing the button is almost impossible because your finger keeps slipping off the button from being wet! I don't even use the shower anymore after two tries-what a waste. Other problems I encountered: During one of her baths, my baby screamed out very loudly! I then realized that my baby's tailbone had made its way down the sling and hit the plastic area where the shower container sits in the tub. I have to constantly lift my baby back up on the sling at least 5-6 times during one bath to prevent her tailbone from getting hurt again! It will be easier to wash my baby once she can sit up on her own and I can ditch the sling too!Neat idea but a bad product."
177720,1,"This mattress is about 2 inches thick and fits well inside the pack in play (especially if you get the quilted pad). There is a little space all around but not to the point of being dangerous. I would highly recommend this product to anyone using a pack n play, especially for a toddler who needs the extra cushioning."
150243,1,"This pad cover is nice and soft, pleasant color, looks nice and it works. It was well packed and it arrived on time."
179611,0,"I am thinking about purchasing the travelmate for a trip to Europe this summer. The reviews are so mixed, that I am uncertain.The largest complaint is about going through security as it won't fix through the X ray machines and then going down the plane aisle. It seems like some airports will hand check it, while others insist it go through the X Ray machine. I guess it just depends what airport you go through. I am departming through Newark and the TSA agents aren't very kind, so I expect a hassle. But for the plane part, isn't it easier to detach the trolley before you enter the plane and put it in the overhead compartment once you get on the plane? Noone seems to do that in their reviews. Is it that hard to detach the car seat from the trolley?Any additional information would be appreciated. Thanks."
38638,1,"As a new mom, it can be a bit confusing when selecting items for your newborn! How the heck are you supposed to know what will work best when you have never done this before? So after my baby shower, I ended up with 3 bathing apparatuses. A infant to toddler tub, a big yellow bath sponge, and the safer bather. At first, I used the yellow sponge on top of a towel on the kitchen table for those sponge baths. Then, when the stump finally fell off, I tried using the sponge tucked inside of the infant tub, but it was a bit awkward and my son was not very comfy. Then, I took out my safer bather and decided to give it a go! Wow, no more screaming thru bathtime as I frantically try to bathe a slippery, angry baby! This was the first time my son relaxed and enjoyed his tub time, and I did too! What I did is filled up our bath tub with a few inches of water and then placed the pad in our own tub. I use enough water so that his body is sitting in it but because of the pillow his head was elevated out of the water. I think that the cushion is nice because it holds the water and keeps him warmer and is soft and conforms to his body. I hang it to dry after in the shower. Buy one of these! You may feel like you need to clean your own tub more often, but its worth it!"
12465,1,"While these were a pain in the neck since they don't stand on their own, they did come in handy. Since breast milk has such a short life span in the refrigerator, it doesn't matter how much you are pumping unless you can freeze it."
163039,1,"I Love this!!!!!! With 2 kids 14 months apart, this is the best way to contain the odors that inhabit the nursery."
42023,1,I love this thing! Its great if you want something simple to keep all of your basic tools for diaper changing all in one place. I've found it very handy! Looks neat and its a great price!
66403,1,"When ordering this bassinet skirt I did not know what to expect. I was having a hard time finding something that would fit my families heirloom bassinet. I was so surprised with the workmanship in this item. It is well made and the eyelet material is just what I was looking for and it fits the bassinet wonderfully. My daugther is very pleased with the way the bassinet looks, it looks very sweet."
82597,1,"This is a great item. I can bring it to daycare, in the car, and with the pack-n-play. The sounds are adjustable and there is a velcro strap to attach to a stroller. My baby loves it!"
177159,1,"I used this Baby ""lotion"" on both of my children and continue to use it on them as 4 and 7 yr olds as well as myself! It is so hard to find in stores now, but often Walmart has it in the pharmacy part of the store with other lotions. I am signed up here on Amazon to be emailed when it is available here again. I also found it available on [...]"
116969,1,"The sturdy sling on this tub is secure & our baby looks comfortable. We like how solid the tub feels, it doesn't move around when placed on a flat surface and drains easily. We've been using it very frequently for the past 3 months. I added a sponge mat underneith to make it super plush for our baby. Thanks to my insomnia during pregnancy, I was able to read tons of reviews that helped me make the right choice. Plus, I don't need to purchase another tub once he reaches the toddler stage, yahaaa! When baby grows out of it, I'm thinking of using it as a feet soaker or recycling it as a childrens planter in the garden. This tub is the way to go!"
27907,0,"Love the stroller straps, but feel it was too expensive. Held up very well, but does not fit more than one childs worth of stuff."
35798,2,"My public health nurse, trained in carseat safety, told me that this product is totally unsafe for use in a carseat. I wound up using the bottom half on my bouncy seat, even though I've read that babies shouldn't sleep upon such thick material, I'll be darned to let my money go to waste and not use this thing at all!"
169709,1,"I didn't want a big clunky plastic high chair in my eat in kitchen for 3 years. I wanted to get something that blended with our style, and also gave our son a chance to feel comfortable eating anywhere.The only complaint i have is that the finish is a bit soft, when we used it in our 3 season room last summer the finish got soft and shows a lot of damage from my son realizing he could pick at it with his little nails.I was able to get the center belt installed so that it is in the top dowel instead of just with the belt, we only belt my son in when he is having difficulty listening to us so its nice that he can't just slip thru the front.I really like this chair!I did buy a 'regular' high chair also so that we would have a more adjustable option and a tray just for him as he learned to eat and feed himself, and we used that from 4 mos to about 14 mos and it is now retired in the basement waiting for the garage sale. At around 6 months old, we started having him use the wood chair with us in the kitchen when we all ate together It is a sturdy chair, I would suggest either gluing in the screw covers or skipping them all together for a younger child, as he was alble to work them out with his little fingers and had them in his mouth in a flash!"
106623,0,"While it is better than the Genie, I found this product to be a disappointment. It does not contain odors very well, not any better than a standard rubbermaid trash can that goes for about $15 cheaper. The diapers would frequently jam when you when you went to rock the handle and dispose of the diaper, smearing poop along the way. We replaced it with the Safety 1st diaper pail which is much easier to use and holds back the odor relatively well."
62193,2,"It took me a LOT of pumping just to get a drop of breast milk out... the suction on this pump is not strong at all. Then after only 2 or 3 days of use the spring broke on the pump, rendering it completely useless. If you're looking for a good manual breast pump at this price range, I would recommend the Avent Isis, which was given to me as a gift and I have had absolutely no trouble with."
5987,1,"I feel so much better knowing that the outlets in my son's room have these outlet covers on them! They were easy to install and are working great so far! As soon as I had them on, I plugged in the lamp and wipe warmer we had plugged in before and they still work great! Also, both of the outlet covers I have opened and installed so far came with screws that worked perfectly."
9889,1,"This potty chair is wonderful. It has a nice, easy to clean design that blends well with any bathroom. It's a good size too. I also like the fact that it doesn't slide around. It has rubber on the bottum that grips any type of floor. I would recommend this item."
118630,2,The product was demonstrated on tv but it does not do what it was advertized to do. Poor quality product.
71664,1,"I bought this car seat because I was looking for something that was going to be very comfortable, safe and yet functional and easy to get around with. I'm on my own a lot, as my spouse travels for work, and I wanted to be able to find easy ways to get around town and do basic things like shopping, eating out or visiting with friends.I spent a lot of time researching seats after I went around inspecting them at stores. I'm beginning to think shopping for car seats is more like buying running shoes. Get the one that fits the best and disregard the color and style issues.Carsafety.org has a forums section where certified professionals who install seats at safety stations give reviews, as well as other parents. Now after using the seat for 10 weeks, I have found that the review was right on target. You can read it at: [...]Anyway, in my own opinion, this is an above average car seat. I don't mind the fact that it doesn't fit in the top of a shopping cart, because balancing a wiggly baby up there never seemed like a safe or good idea to me anyway. I usually put him in my baby carrier for that, so he can snuggle while I shop.I found this car seat easy to install in the middle of my backseat in my small Volkswagen Golf. There is enough room for adults to sit on either side of the seat, as well. My husband also drives a small car, a Mazda RX-8. The Combi Connection fit in the backseat fine, but anyone tall was going to have trouble sitting in front of it because the Mazda seat couldn't go back very far without hitting the Combi. (That's more of a car issue than an infant seat issue) I also bought the Combi City Savvy stroller for $89, and it is incredibly easy to manuever around the tightest spaces, even with the seat installed in the stroller. When you walk on a sidewalk, you really only take up your half of the sidewalk rather than the whole thing. Warning: This is not the stroller/infant carseat combination for anyone who likes to use their stroller as a shopping cart. It's like owning a much more comfortable umbrella stroller which just happens to fit your carseat than one of the mega huge strollers on the market.Out of the base, and on a floor, this car seat rocks. That is, sometimes when my baby has trouble sleeping, I'll put him in the seat and he'll feel cocooned. I'll rock him, and he'll fall asleep. Of course, he always falls asleep in the car. I'm not sure if it's the seat he finds that comfortable or just the motion. It could be a combination of the two.This seat also theoretically works well in a travel situation. Not only does it click into two of the Combi strollers easily, but there are instructions on how to use the carseat without a base. So, putting it on an airplane or a rental car for a limited vacation without carrying something extra is a plus. I don't think I'll have a chance to test it out on an airplane though -- I had a 10 lb baby at birth, and at 10 weeks he's almost 17 lbs and 25 inches. Other reviewers claim that their baby had trouble fitting the straps at this size. My baby hasn't had any issues, unless we have him in a considerably bulky sweatshirt at this stage. But even then it's snug, not tight. We don't have any issues with the strap around the diaper area either (we're using Pampers Dry Fit and/or Seventh Generation diapers).I do, however, expect him to out grow the seat by 5 months. This isn't a drawback of this particular seat, as MOST small and easy to carry around infant carseats have similar weight and height restrictions. I just happened to have had a gentle giant for a child.My husband attended a car seat installation class at our local hospital where they said carseats, like diapers, really depend on the size and shape of your baby. Unfortunately, you often don't know the shape and size of your baby until it's born and getting another carseat isn't as easy as buying new diapers...The one drawback I have with this seat is that the turning cranks which allow you to move the handle back over the top of the seat to make getting your infant in and out of it easier are rather thick and wide. Therefore, the seat does not fit very well into most restaurant booths, nor will they fit in the old ""turn the booster seat upside down"" method (which also never felt very safe to me -- even though my spouse reminds me the kid is strapped into a crash seat).Some restaurants like TGI Friday's have infant seat cradles made of nylon that they set up at your table. The seat fit well into one of those, but if you don't want your baby sitting on the floor in the way of the wait staff, you might want to request a table to put the child in a chair next to you or put him into the stroller and have him sit in the stroller next to you.I am very happy I ordered this seat. It works very well and my baby seems to find it comfortable and accomodating. Spending $150 on a car seat doesn't seem like a luxury to me -- I'd rather have him safe and comfortable while riding in the car than get a different seat that might not fit him right or jeopardize his safety in an accident. In other words, it's worth the extra money.I hope he finds his next seat as comforting."
96641,0,"My toddler threw it accross the room and it landed on the hardwoods and the nob broke off. Thank goodness I was right there when it happened because my 6 month old could have gotten a hold of it and choked on it! It's the perfect choking size! I couldn't believe how easy it broke off. I wrote the company to let them know so hopefully they can change the design, I have not heard back from them.Other than it being a choking hazard, it's a cute stuffed animal...the sound machine is very quite, so probably not the best for white noise"

26172,1,"I am so thrilled with my new stroller! I spent a lot of time researching for the perfect stroller. I have a 4 yr old and a 19 month old and our old stroller finally gave out. I wanted something compact and light. Something stylish yet practical. I was finally trying to decide between the Graco Quattro and the Pliko P3. Ultimately I chose against the Graco because of the size. I am so glad I did! The Pliko opens and closes beautifully. The steering is smooth and easy. My 4 yr old loves to stand on the back and my 19 mo old loves the comfort of the seat. The adjustable handles are perfect for my 6' 1"" husband and for myself (I'm 5'3""). The umbrella cover snaps on and removes very easily and it also closes over the stroller competely. The basket is on the smaller side but it works wonderfully for me. I bought a diaper bag that hangs on the handles, and I actually like it more because everything is so accessible. It is in the pricer side, but you really do get what you pay for. It also got great ratings on Consumer Reports. I bought it in mint. Did I mention how happy I am with this stroller?"
151648,1,"When I first purchased Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil I was skeptical at first. The reviews were great, but I'm always one to be doubtful of a products quality. Within the first week I could already see a great difference on my stretch marks that were on my stomach. I've had pretty bad looking ones from puberty and from significant weight loss, 30 pounds, and my stretch marks are less noticeable. I'm so glad I bought Earth Mama. I definitely will buy again."
151994,2,"Ours is now just a piece of useless plastic, for two reasons:1) Our doors are 8' tall and the pathetic little plastic wand that they supply to slide it with isn't long enough for anyone less than 7' tall to use.2) It takes two - like many people we have a PAIR of folding doors and we thought that we were getting two of these, instead of just one. Maybe the advertizing should state that you only get one and not two as we had expected."
148906,1,"the pillow is generally good. the top of the horseshoe is a bit thick and was uncomfortable for my neck at first but over time i have gotten in to smoosh down a bit. i tried sleeping with it upside down like they suggest to do if you feel it is too thick, but when i do it it does not support my belly it the right spot and it is hard to roll over while half asleep. the pillow case is also kinda rough. but the shape is great and i really like the support it gives my belly and my back."
34112,1,"This cover is amazing! It is so durable. If you're going to spend 20 dollars on a cheap plastic one, you might as well drop 20 more for something that will really protect your seat. It fits our Chicco Keyfit30 perfect and my husband said the shoulder straps are comfortable and the bag is easy to wear. Best cover for the money!"
1457,0,"I had some leaks with these and they have a strong smell. I am getting the LUV's instead which smell a little less, hold up just as good if not better and are cheaper."
98883,1,"I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand, they didn't work as well (tabs not restickable, not as absorbent, etc) and we went back to Pampers. I discovered Baby Dry because we were in Mexico and that was the type of Pampers they had in the Costco there - baby dry is great - they are thin and super absorbent. Amazon is the best place to buy them - especially if you use subscribe and save."
18606,1,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stroller! I was a little leary after reading the reviews, but went ahead a took a chance. It is a little heavier than what I expected, but it's just because it is built well and has aluminum instead of plastic. It feels like nothing will break on this. It is very sturdy and definitely kid proof. I like the fact that there is not a bar in front of the child - it makes it easier to get my kiddos in and out. The cup holder is nice and I am going to contact the manufacturer and see if I can order another one for the other side. It is easy to put together (less than 5 minutes) and it is easy to put up and take down, once you get used to it. The basket does have the metal bars through it, but a medium-sized purse can go on top and maybe some smaller bags on the bottom - it was better than I thought it would be after reading the reviews. My 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old fit in here wonderfully. The wheels work fine, just make sure the brakes are off on ALL of the wheels, or else they will stick. Handles are nice and no bending over to push! Very satisfied with purchase - if hesitant, go for it!"
4071,0,This bedrail needs a boxspring in order to work properly. We have a set of bunk beds and had no boxspring as bunk beds don't require them. There was no where to hook the anti gap hooks to so we had to improvise. FAIR WARNING!!
140748,1,"We installed this barrier in a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Our goal was to keep the dog from accidentally jumping on the baby :) The barrier was easy to assemble, came with good instructions and seems to be very sturdy as well as highly adjustable. The dog jumped right up and seemed to like 'his space'... give us a month and we'll let you know how the baby likes it. After a lot of researching/looking around, it seems that this barrier is the best you may find for the money!"
160660,1,"I love this crib sheet because of its ease of removal and replacement and its protection against all leaks and blowouts. A friend had recommended it and Im so glad she did. From the side you cannot even see it is there because it sits on top of the sheet (it is nice to have the matching sheet for the set to look nice). When a leak happens, just unsnap, throw in the wash, and replace when dried (or buy two which makes it easier). That way you are not fighting trying to cover the mattress with a sheet each time, lifting and tucking, etc. This does make life much easier."
88031,1,"We bought this for our son when he was 2 1/2 months old. He loved it then, but could only stand that much stimulation for about 10-15 minutes at a time. Now he is 4 1/2 months and spends much more time under it! My only problem with this mat is that it didn't come with many toys, and the ones that it did come with didn't have enough links on them to make them accessible to the baby. However, this problem was easily, and cheaply fixed.... JUST BUY MORE LINKS. You can add tons of toys to this mat. Buy a box of links and just creative with the toys you have at home!"
182788,0,For the money this seat is pretty good. I bought it for my niece to use on occasion in my car and it works out perfectly. It does lack padding so I wouldn't recommend it for a seat a child would use on a daily basis.
141195,1,"My baby is 11 months old tommorow. We bought this as a birthday gift but as soon as it arrived we gave it to her. It was easy to put together, even I could handle it and a few snaps later it was ready to roll. As soon as my baby saw it in the box and it started to make noise she threw her hands up and started smiling and dancing. She does not walk yet buy can stand. She did not hesitate at all to stand up with it and walk across the living room! I also love that you can take the face with all the toys off and set it on the floor to play if you want. It is VERY easy to take on and off. My only negative is that the phone has no string or chord to is so I have a feeling that is going to get lost. I get that it may be so there is no choking/strangling danger but the shapes have small curly chords so I wish the phone did too. We are looking forward to a lot more fun with this toy!"
166549,1,"Great product, arrives on time in a perfect box each time. Can't beat the great price!"
56411,1,"super easy to use. they open really easy for me. not sure why people say they're hard to open. they did draw my toddler's attention when we first installed them. but since all they did was spin and he couldn't grab onto them, he lost interest. completely satisfied with this purchase."
51265,1,"I LOVE this pillow. I needed more back support than my regular ol' body pillow was giving me. I tried this pillow against the suggestions of my friends and boy was I glad I did! It is not too big/bulky and fits comfortably in my queen bed with my husband and I. Gave great leg/tummy/back/neck support and I highly recommend it. Was a little awkward at first, but it helped keep me on my side when back sleeping was no longer an option."
65518,1,"We recently moved to the historic district in a small town in Louisiana. We love that we can walk to church, restaurants, our children's school and have a great path scoped out for walking. We had a double umbrella stroller for our two kids. We purchased the jogging stroller and I love it!!! The side walks here can get really bumpy (it is Louisiana) and the stroller takes it with ease. It has made walking so much more enjoyable. The only complaint I have is the break is at a weird angle (maybe hubby's screwdriver can change that) and the wrist strap to prevent roll aways is really long and just hangs and gets really annoying. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STROLLER FOR ANYONE WITH TWO KIDS!!!!!!!"
132491,1,Few things compare to the great feeling I get when I can wipe down my babies with WARM wipes! You do need to add water to keep the wipes from drying out (about half a cup per package of wipes...just pour it in over the top of the wipes). This wipe warmer is a must-have for a newborn nursery.
147126,1,I got this for my three year old and he really loves to draw all over the walls while in the tub. Sometimes he does not want to take a bath and I just remind him of his bath crayons that he can draw with and he is undressing for a bath! They wash off really easily too! He helps with the clean up even! Great product!
6072,1,"We just bought this seat for my son - he is 5 months old and is very tall for his age - he's about 27 inches now. He outgrew the infant carrier by the time he was 4 months old, but I hated to part with it, so I put off buying a convertible seat for a month. I did extensive research and the Britax was the only one that seemed to get consistent good reviews, and the other thing that sold me was the safety rating, the best around.Luckily I had a seat to return that I had gotten at a baby shower, so that offset the price of getting the Britax by $100, but it would still be worth it paying full price. This seat is amazing. SOooooooo easy to install, even though our car is older and doesn't have the latch system. The material is high quality, I was very impressed. I also love the velcro tabs on the side that hold the harness apart for taking baby in and out of the seat. Very nice feature especially on hot days, and also the ease of adjusting the tightness/looseness of the harness.....just the push of a button! When my husband came with me to buy it, he was at first drawn to the other car seats that had all the ""bells and whistles"" but I convinced him to go with this one and he is glad he did! This seat is so secure in our car, it does not move.....unlike our infant carrier base which had a tendency to slip and slide a bit. Our son is so comfortable in it, and when he falls asleep, his head does not flop forward like it did in the infant carrier, which I love.We go on vacation next Sunday and it will be a 10 hour drive, and I would not be looking forward to the drive with a baby if it weren't for this car seat.This is one item where you aren't paying extra just for the name brand.....you are getting a quality, ease, and comfortable seat that is so worth it!"
95039,2,"I used this pump everyday and after 30 days of use, the pump broke. It would shut off on its own. I wouldn't recommend this pump to anyone."
37,1,"i do not use these for warming the food. i did try that once and it was just a pain. i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair. so they are great for that, but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish."
12205,1,I was looking for bulk baby oil to use for a baby wipe solution because we use reusable baby wipes. This was the most cost efficient product out there. I only wish it came in larger bottles.
39709,2,"...but for adults that are light sleepers, its no good. I work nights, and I need to be able to block out the noise of traffic while I sleep. This sound machine came today before I went to bed, so I plugged it in & tried it out. With this machine on its loudest setting, 2 fans on in the room (for additional 'white noise') and my windows closed & covered with heavy blankets, I could still hear and get woken up by the sporadic traffic outside my house. We are not talking car alarms, horns, & people shouting, here. People drive by at about 40mph and that is what wakes me up.The only time of year I sleep well is during the summer, because so far the only thing I've found thats loud enough to block out the cars is our old, loud, ineffecient air conditioner.PROS:~The 'combine' feature is neat, though I wish you could combine any two instead of just 1 from each category.~The rain sound is very soothing, and I didn't notice any blatant pattern in it. I combined it with the thunder sound, which was cool.CONS:~Not loud enough to block traffic noise.~The secondary sounds: thunder, birds, buoy, etc; are all noticably repetitive, and distracting when you're trying to quiet your mind. As much as I liked the effect of playing the rain and the thunder at the same time, I had to shut the thunder off, because it kept waking me up. Too sporadic, and too loud in comparison the the quieter, more regular rain sound.SUMMARY:If you don't need louder sounds, and don't use the secondary sound buttons, or only need it for the baby; get it. It does what it says it does. The primary sounds are nice. But if you are the light sleeper, look elsewhere! For my needs it was definately not worth the (2 week) wait after ordering. I am returning mine tomorrow. Let's hope the manufacturer doesn't give me any trouble. I'll follow up if they do!~"
125170,1,"My son was not too sure at first because this item did not ""work"" like a normal pacifier, but once he realized he can chew on it, he LOVED it!! It's easy for him to grab the handle on the back and chomp on any part of the item. He's 5 months old and learning to grab things so this was a nice safe thing for him to work with."
16854,1,A great product. I have purchased two and recommend them to all my friends with rolling children. Excellent for children in large beds. Never worried about my kids getting stick or falling. Excellent product!
87372,1,"I have three daughters....10, 7, &amp;amp; 4 months. I used the original Playtex bottles with my older daughters and they were great. Even when I would get tired of buying the liners and would try other reusable bottles...I would always go back to the Playtex. During this last pregnancy..I couldn't wait to try the Playtex Premiums!!! My baby is on Nutramigen and her pediatrician requests the powder because it is easier to digest; she also has reflux and he suggested these bottles to help her with that problem. She VERY RARELY spits up. On the reusable bottles, it left a film and they were hard to clean. I really wanted to use the VentAire Natural Shapes, but she would still spit up. These are so easy for me! I am a full time legal assistant to a Judge, have 2 very active older daughters, and a husband that is back in college &amp; works fulltime.....therefore, time is of the essence!!! Scrubbing bottles is the last thing I need each night!! I HIGHLY recommend these bottles for their convenience. Also, on the leaking liners...everynow and then I have one to leak..but if the top is on tight and you push the air out gently....the liners are great! THANK YOU PLAYTEX!!!!"
95026,1,"This Pump works great since the first use. My wife had the manual pump from the same brand, it was difficult, long and very hard to get only 2 onz. With the electric pump, in only 10 minutes you can get almost 4 onz from each breast, I recomended, its worth the money."
23470,2,"I needed a lightweight stroller that was easy to load and unload and it appeard from all aspects to be just that. And it was cute too! A week after I got this stroller, we were at the beach on the vacation that I purchased this stroller for, when the front wheel fell off. I checked to make sure I had put it on correctly and I had. This happens all the time and so I never use the stroller. I was very disappointed, I should have followed up and had them replace it but I hate sending things back and had already thrown away all my information and packaging. Bummed."
125270,2,"This product is sturdy and looks to be durable. It looks the way it did as pictured.The problem is, my three-month-old had teething symptoms (turned out her pediatrician said she isn't cutting teeth, but experiencing what he called ""pre-teething"" which looks the same and causes some discomfort). Her mouth is too small for most products designed for teething and she doesn't have the motor skills for many of them. This looked to be perfect, since she could use it like her paci.Even though this is labeled as OK for 3 months plus, it's too big for my daughter--she gagged on it repeatedly and spit it out. When I checked, she wasn't just being fussy--the raspberry part was big enough to reach the far back of her mouth and gag her.Looks like this would be a good product for an older child, but if you want something for a very young teether, keep searching!"
79657,1,"This toy chest is colorful, cheery, and baby friendly. my 9 months old son loves to play on the activity mat and pull the sun mirror off from it. i love the way the tote comes out and you can dump all the toys on the floor for him to play. afterwards just put everything back and slide it back in its compartment, and the activity mat folds right up and leaves everything neat and clean. However, it DOES smell! when the lid opens/closes, the odor comes out from within. I think it is the material that this chest is made from. I left the top open to air it out, after awhile the smell gets less. But leaving it covered overnight collects the smell again. I love it enough that the smell doesn't bother me as much, but I wouldn't think stick your head in there after it's been closed for awhile is a good idea. it would be rated a 5 if it's not for the smell."
26940,1,"Overall, this is a good product. It's affordable, not bulky, easy to use, not obvious under clothing, and most importantly, decreased the horrible pelvic pain I started feeling in my 3rd trimester. After wearing this for a week, the pain has lessened and I'm able to more easily stand and walk (or waddle as the case may be). It doesn't start to feel annoying/itchy/constricting until after a full day's worth of sitting at work. It doesn't need to be removed during bathroom trips. A note on sizing: I was between a small and a medium, and as I have a few more weeks to grow, I opted for a medium. Wearing it comfortably at the tightest setting did nothing for the pain, so I took another reviewer's advice and resewed a set of closures another setting's length tighter. Hope this product works as well for you as it does for me."
109425,1,"I give this as a gift to every pregnant woman I know! Sure, they won't use it right away, but once you introduce solids this is an essential item. It helps introduce baby to fruits and veggies with out fear of choking. Additionally, it helps with teething pains and is a great distraction tool while you try to have adult dinner conversation :)"
25454,0,"I ordered enough of these for all of my lower cabinets and installed them. For the most part it was easy and quick installation but there were two of them that didn't lock at all after I installed them (the same way that I installed the rest of them, I have no idea if it was me or the lock). They ended up breaking in the process of me trying to get them to lock and then readjusting them. For as much as I paid for these, it was upsetting to have to replace two of them.A couple days after I installed them, I hear my daughter banging around in the kitchen and I go in there and one of the cabinets that had previously locked perfectly was wide open and she was chewing on a bottle of jet dry. I figured I had somehow not closed it all the way but then I couldn't get it to lock at all. Then for the next day it wouldn't lock. So I figured it was broken, but then the next day it locked just fine. Since then there is another one that periodically doesn't lock.I'm not sure what to say about them, some of them work perfectly and are great, but I have no idea when one of them is not going to lock. If I can't rely on them, what good are they? I'm going to call a handiman and have him install handles so I can put the cheap plastic locks on them that I know will work."
121909,1,"This product attaches and detaches quickly from the Bjorn and it really helps to keep baby warm and dry. Of course on really cold days here in Ohio my baby still wears a winter suit, like a baby bunting, but that's not enough, layering this on is perfect and lets us be outside for a little while. As the weather gets warmer we will be able to use it more and then even without another layer underneath."
167657,1,"I love the toddler bedding set I received for my daughter's bed. It's bright and cheery and matches her bedroom perfectly. I love the fact that the sheet is gathered and elasticized on the bottom like the mattress sheet so that it stays on the mattress no matter how much my daughter tosses and pulls on the sheet. She loves the soft, warm fleece blanket that lays on top. This is definitely a beautiful bedding set."
118830,1,"The Compass Deluxe Booster will be the best purchase you'll ever make! I love Britax, but when it came to the transition of moving my 5 yr old daughter to a booster seat, I soon realized that she would outgrow most of the booster seats in height and width before she would in weight.I'm a mom and a former baby store manager...so I do my homework. Safety always comes first! The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rated the booster straight A's, except for a B they gave it on ""how well the instructions show how to properly use the child safety seat""...but I think is common sense. The overall Rating was an A. It was also recommended by consumer reports.These were my findings:*The side impact as well as the overall testing was quite impressive.*Headrest telescopes up for height adjustment, that doesn't leave a gap...unlike competitors.*Headrest also adds enough neck support when your child falls asleep without obstructing view.*Velour fabric almost always stays cool and clean...besides the print will not be too babyish as she gets older. Besides who doesn't love giraffe print?*Captain armrests seem to make the ride more comfortable, and nice that they move out of the way for buckling.*I purchased this deluxe model, as it had much more padding for those long rides.*It was easy enough for my 5 year old to buckle herself.* The cup holders are on both sides which is great that they hideaway when not in use.*Folds compact enough to put in overhead or trunk. You know how the airlines treat your luggage...do you really want to trust them with your child's life?Weight/Height Range: 30-100lbs/38""-57""Harness Type: High BackOn a side note- Did you know that if you are in an accident (even if your child is not involved), the car seat MUST be replaced? The molding may not show that it is warped form the collision, but may not protect your child in the next accident. I promise you your insurance will not volunteer this information, but they have to replace your car seat for the same value. This is why you should NEVER buy a 2nd hand car seat, unless you personally know the person selling it."
102130,1,"I have a special needs son and these work well. The only problem is that sometimes the sides come apart, but I think that occasionally I will get a bad batch. I order these regularly and most of them hold up well."
79558,1,We purchased the BOB Revolution Jogging stroller as our only stroller for our second daughter and it made this diaper bag a must. The stroller has very limited room on the bottom for anything and a diaper bag would never fit down there. So we had to get this bag. It attaches onto the handlebar and it's really great. It's the only bag we use even when we aren't using the stroller. My only complaint is that it's very narrow.It's hard to fit anything round into it like a can of formula and such.
24176,1,"We've bought two of these swings and the babies do great in them. They learn to play, enjoy the music, and (thankfully) even get some sleep time. Easy to operate, clean, and move around. Highly recommended."
7840,0,"Once you finally figure out how to put the rail together, it's a piece of cake to assemble. I love how compact it is while traveling. My biggest complaint is that it is a little short. I wish it were at least 6-12 inches longer. I wouldn't use this as a permanent bed rail for my daughter, but it's great for travel."
99396,2,"I was really unhappy using these,they leaked badly many times.In the past I have used the Pampers Cruisers and was very happy with them.I now buy Huggies little movers since I feel those are the best diapers around."
125979,1,"Love these diapers. For size 1 I liked the Little Snugglers better, but now that baby is older and rolls around more when sleeping, I notice the Snug and Dry leak less at night. However, they do leak somtimes when she sleeps on her side..."
161615,2,DO NOT BUY THIS TUB...it is a waste of money. i was very disappointed with this tub. water leaks out @ the bottom. I had to buy a new one.
7695,2,"I bought this cologne with the vintage and they sent me two of the vintage, so i'm not sure if this is a good cologne."
182946,0,I am not sure if I really have enough to say about this product to make a twenty word review. I have only used one of the latches so far. What I did find ( so far at least ) is this--- the adhesive that is supposed to attach the latches is not good enough. I finally used epoxy adhesiveto fasten them in place. Time will tell if they last after continued use.
156992,1,My daughter loves this toy! She loved it at 4 1/2 months and she's 8 months now and still loves it! I put her in it when I have to do things and can't keep my eye on her and she squeals in delight whenever she's in it!!! We collapse it when we go places for the day. It's a lifesaver! YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS!
37100,1,"The only reason that I did not give the gate a rating of 5 stars was due to price. I installed the gate in one of my bedroom door openings. It is nice and sturdy and it does close on its own. That was the key selling point to me. Not everyone remembers to close the gate behind themselves and that defeats the purpose of a gate in the first place. I do not want it to ever stand open on its own. I love the gate, I just wish that it was a little cheaper so I could install in into more of my door frames."
97137,1,"What a great gift for the new parents who have EVERYTHING already. This is so cute, it's a major hit with them! I've given it twice already and wouldn't mind having one myself!Cloud b Sleep Sheep - Four Soothing Sounds From Nature"
149892,2,this is junk. it's a pain to take off and on we used it once before my daughter pulled it off and threw it on the floor. waste of money.
47545,1,"I like this because it was very easy to setup (it unfolds quite magically) and the strap that goes under the mattress keeps it quite securely close to the bed. The only complaint I have is that they don't include any height adjusters with it. So I will have to order them seperately.We decided the baby needed to sleep on a slight incline, so we ordered a foam wedge from Amazon."
61081,1,"I love my diaper genie. I use if for smelly diapers only since the refils are kind of expensive. I find that I save a lot more money this way. I also had a little trouble putting it together and the bag does not stay twisted after the first few diapers, but I don't find it to be a problem overall."
27415,1,"The American Baby Company Waterproof porta-crib mattress pad is excellent! Soft, durable, installs easily, and washes well. Our grandbabies slept well!"
152708,0,"This worked great for my little guy for months. But since he got to about 14 lbs, the thing barely moves - even with new batteries and on the highest speed. That's fine for us - we got good use out of it because he's 8 months and crawling now - but I know many babies reach 14 lbs much sooner! He still likes to swing though, and it is a disappointment I have to kick it with my foot to keep him swinging! They say birth to 2 years but obviously not!"
107073,1,"I LOVE my diaper champ!It is easy to use, conveniently uses regular garbage bags and holds a ton of diapers!If it smells, use two bags or go for thicker ones.Spray it with Lysol after each and every change- it takes 30 seconds to do this.Once in a while, spray it with a diluted bleach solution and rinse it in the tub.But the Lysol really does kill the odor!Change it and clean it people and it won't stink!"
108800,1,"This works so well.. it took 3 days and no more cradle cap. This wasn't the first product I tried either. Not only that, but my baby is SO sensitive. This is the only non-organic product she's been able to use with no irritation. And it lasts FOREVER. It probably works out to be about the same cost as Johnson and Johnson."
160128,1,"We find this item allows to easily swaddle our squirming infant. It is especially great to use in the recently cold evenings. Much to our surprize and delight, he stays secure and swaddled through the night. It is also easy to change his diaper without rousing him too much. We have found a good wrap will calm him down when fussy. This is a great find."
35596,1,"I was a little wary of buying this product just because of the price tag, but when I compared it to the other shopping cart covers, this one just seemed to be a better product. After owning it for several months now, I can honestly say I'm thrilled with this cover! It is so easy to put on (although, as with any cart cover, you have to use a little strategy if you're by yourself with your little one). But it's cushy enough to be comfortable for my 12-month-old if she falls asleep in the cart. She loves the wild design of the fabric. And it stores itself as a bag. Every time I've used this, at least one person has stopped me and asked me where I found it. Oh, and you can also use it as a cover for those wooden restaurant highchairs, too. Buy this today!!!!"
158110,1,"We had a preemie son 2 1/2 years ago and although he was sent home from the hospital on an apnea monitor, I would have loved to have known about this Angelcare monitor at the time that he was removed from the apnea monitor (which was about 2 months after he was brought home). We now have a 10 week old daughter (full-term) and I found out about this WONDERFUL system through our new pediatrician who recommended it to us because our newborn will only sleep on her tummy. It's a GREAT piece of mind tool and allows us to place her on her stomach at all times without the worry of SIDS. I highly recommend this to all parents, especially parents of children that only want to sleep on their tummies!"
17646,1,"I was looking for a stroller similar to the Graco Snap N Go type stroller (which I love) and believe that I found it. It is nice and small to get through aisles in stores, it is comfortable for my 10 month old baby and it folds up super small for transportation. My only issues would be that the storage compartment isn't very big, there isn't a tray to hold drinks and the sun viser doesn't really protect the baby. But, these things would probably add size and weight so I will take the smaller stroller for these items. I really like it."
39033,0,I received two of these in this size. They are cheaper than most covers and seem to hold up well to everyday use. They were huge on daughter. When she was in the weight range the waists would be really loose. She is of average if not above average size. They are also really inconvenient if you have to change a poopy diaper as they only pull down and if the diaper is wet then you have to lay the wet diaper on your changing pad.
95411,1,I didnt realize how large this Hammock was! it takes a large amount of corner/wall space but seems to be holding up pretty well and seems sturdy enough for all of my daughters stuffed animals.
79834,1,The cushion works perfectly as expected and cleans up well. I think it looks much better than the basic one that comes with the chair as a combination package.
131422,1,This keeps my seats from getting all gummyfied and that is great. It also keeps the 2 rigid lines from being there that all carseats make.
64713,0,"I just got this toy set. And I found that it is 5 piece set instead of 6, which made me confused."
103927,0,"I think this is an OK breast pump, although I have not tried any other kind. The whole kit and bag are all very nice, stylish and well made. My complaint is that there are so many pieces to clean and assemble. I went back to work and found myself taking an extra 15 minutes to disassemble, wash, dryand reassemble each piece. I also live on the third floor and to carry this heavy bag, my child in his carseat and the diaper bag was a tedious chore. I always felt that the pumps were top heavy and would topple over. I purchased the plastic storage containers from Avent but did not like that i was putting the cap to seal the milk on the counter top to hold the cup steady (when assembled to the pump). The silver bags to keep the milk cool did not really do anything special. The suction seemed to be stronger on one side than the other from time to time but the suction pattern memory was really nice.Overall, yes it is well made and probably a good pump. If I could change anything, I would make less pieces to clean, more stable when standing upright and lighter."
142817,1,I bought these after weeks of being frustrated from not expressing enough milk. Going up in size of breastshield if you are an average women makes a big difference. Less pinching and I found that I was able to pump faster and more. I forgot to buy the connector and valves when I purchased these as I didn't realize it wasn't the same as the breastshield that comes with the Medela PIS. So remember to buy the additional parts. Great that they come apart for cleaning.
163714,0,"The chair is very practical at the time of placing the baby and do other things in your house, besides when you go to feed your baby. Excellent product."
14064,0,"My newborn didnt do well with any of the other bottles but she does great with these. For my daughter these bottles are ideal but they do leak which is quite a problem. Without the leaking I would give these bottles 5 stars. This could definitly be a problem for moms who use breastmilk in these bottles b/c sometimes that milk is hard to come by and your time put into pumping it and the value of every drop is wasted in a mere second. As far as gas, vomiting, etc...these so far are great for my little one."
45831,1,"we are really pleased with this product; it's just the right size, easily opens and closes for cleaning, and best of all our son loves the comfortable cushioned seat. we found the ""attachment for boys"" a little irritating and dispensed with the product, I suppose it is useful for more squeemish parents but it wasn't for us. didn't detract from the product itself."
145371,1,"My 5 month old baby loves her jumper, but at 26&#34; tall and only 15 # she can't quite touch the floor in the lowest setting. We had to fold up a couple towels to put under her feet. When she isn't jumping she is playing with the bug or swatting at the toys in the front. Be careful putting your child into it though, it can be a little tricky to get their feet into the holes. I bought this one because it can kind of fold up, and we have a very small living area. It doesn't save a lot of room, but in our house any extra space helps. It is almost a two person job to move it when it is folded, though, as it loses it's stable foundation. Overall, easy to put together, easy to clean, baby loves it, what else is there to say?"
99537,1,"When my son was born I tried different brands of diapers (many were shower gifts). I quickly decided to only use Pampers Baby Dry. He had regular diaper ""blow outs"" with all of the other brands. My son is now 2.5 years old and we are working on transitioning him from Pampers to the potty. I've never found a better price than the price that I get with Amazon Mom and their diaper suscription. If I ever have another baby I will once again use Pampers (but Huggies wipes!) Best of luck."
20479,2,"I received this as a baby gift (not put together yet). I'm sure if the person giving the gift had put it together beforehand and realized it was junk, they wouldn't have given it as a gift. This bassinet is very poorly constructed. DO NOT BUY."
40006,0,"The reason I am on here is because after using this in our kids bedroom for a few years, I have finally started using it for myself and found it quite annoying. Although when demoing it seems like a good product, most of the sounds are too repetitive and actually keep me from falling asleep. What I am basically looking for now is a sound machine with a good rain setting. The one on this unit repeats like every 3 seconds."
77444,1,"We used this swing with our baby from the first night she came home from the hospital and refused to sleep in the playard bassinet. She must have felt much cosier in the swing because she went right to sleep (even without the motion).i love the nature sounds and the volume control has a good range. My only complaint is that the slowest swing setting is still really fast. It seems slower now that our baby is almost three months, but at 7lbs, it seemed like it might give her whiplash. I have never used it on anything but the slowest speed.Now it is such a life saver and soothes her even in those colicky evening hours. I definitely recommend and would buy again. Thank you, FP!"
97757,0,"These bottles worked well for us with our newborn (using size 2 nipples) until we purchased a bottle warmer. The warmer heats using steam which caused the seal on the bottom to come loose. This led to a leaky bottle and a very frustrated mom and baby. I've since switched to Dr. Brown's bottles. I like those bottles much better: the nipples don't collapse as baby feeds, no air gets into the formula, and they work with our bottle warmer."
156080,1,"The greatest surprise we found when we got it was how twistable it was. I thought it was going to be just forming an 8 but it has so many different shapes then i find myself playing with it while my daughter plays with something else. It is very entertaining even for older kids.My 7 month old daughter likes it very much. it grew with her. We bought it when she was 4 month old and just liked to suck it, now she bangs it on the floor or the table. it is resistent, noisy enught and the rubber part is nice."
9552,0,"I bought this potty for my 26 month old son. I agree with the other reviewers that this potty is a breeze to empty and clean, with no hidden cracks or crevices to collect bacteria. However, this potty just doesn't work for little boys. The pee guard isn't high enough and, even though he aims down, every time my son pees it runs down the front and all over the floor. The guard needs to be higher for little boys!"
66923,1,"Quite a bit cheaper than at the store. We're borrowing a pump from my sister, so we just needed this kit and (thought we needed) some tubing. Turns out, no milk moves through the tubing though, so if you get a used pump, no need to replace the tubing :).This kit is all we needed!"
85616,0,"For the price I HAD to get this because my boyfriend is a huge Duke fan and is starting the little one on the same tradition young. Would have liked to see more item details in the description, the mobile doesn't latch on to the side of the crib because the wood beams are too big. The music has a weird chirp to it every 6 seconds or so. Thought it just might be the way the song is supposed to sound, but it's not. I would buy it again at the sale price but never for full price."
165782,1,Bottom line I absolutely love the product from my child and think the price is great! Amazon does a great job shipping and it is one less thing I have to put in my cart at the grocery store. Buy diapers on Amazon one of the best things I have done as a mom.
20270,1,"I love them! Being a first time mom and tring new things out, We had gone through several bottles and no luck. It was always the case of my daughter sucking in too much air. Then by chance we tried them and have been using them since. We started out when she was about 6wks old and she had no problem going from from breastfeeding to bottle. She was less gassy and did not spit up as soon as she was done from all the air that was sucked in while feeding. Then recently we had started using the Natural Shape bottles and she is able to hold those a lot better as well as drink from the nipple. The only down fall about the bottles are tring to locate replacment vent dics. Since my daughter had started eating cereal in her bottle the cereal settles along the the bottom of the vent disc and in the small vent holes. Even after daily cleaning and rinsing after use they still have a hard time coming clean. But overall they are the best bottles my daughter has used an reasonable priced as well."
3870,2,I am a religious shopper of Amazon and have NEVER been more disappointed. The item in the picture is not the item that was delivered to my home. The nipple is much longer and not flat as shown in the picture. This is false advertising and I would not recommend going through with your purchase of this item.
132251,0,"I had some cups like this I had bought 2 years ago that had measurments on the side, which I loved! I just assumed these did and they did not. I am going to contact Gerber and ask why they quit putting them on the side of the cup. I mean your making a cup for babies/toddlers why wouldnt you put measurements on the side????? are I breast feed and dont use bottles and these are the best cups I have found."
81519,2,"This is such a horrible monitor! I received it at my shower because I had registered for it based on good feedback. Once we had the twins and actually used it, we found that there was a popping sound every minute or so and static about 1/3 of the time!! We are planning on returning it as soon as we can make it out to Babies R Us. We ended up buying a Graco one that works just wonderfully!"
183733,0,"I registered for this item b/c I knew I wanted a backpack style diaper bag. I wouldn't recommend this bag but would recommend getting a backpack style because it makes it so much easier to carry your baby plus everything else you need-you don't have to deal with straps that fall off your shoulders or the ones you would put across you that will just bring a lot attention to your chest!Anyway, the problems that I have with this bag are...1. The side compartment that is lined to keep bottles cold is way too small. I use Advent bottles and you can barely fit 2 and you can barely fit one if you want to put an icepack in too.2. The shape of the bag and the way the large compartment opens makes is difficult to get to things at the bottom of the bag and keep it organized.3. The other side pocket is also small and b/c the shape of the bag make it difficult to keep things organized and easy to find.4. Basically-the shape of the bag-though it may look cool-makes the bag, in my opinion, not very user friendly. I am constantly trying to keep it organized, it tips over easily and it's just not big enough.I know most of the reviews say they love the bag and I relied heavily on Amazon reviews of items when I registered.I will say the bag is very comfortable and well put together but for me it can be frustrating to use. Hope this helps!!"
14822,2,"I registered for these bottles since I heard wonderful things about them...but they made my son VERY gassy. He's cry all night in pain. I switched to Johnson and Johnson bottles and he hardly even burps anymore. So many people like these bottles so I wouldn't say not to try them, but for us, they didn't work out at all."
81497,1,We have had no problem with this monitor except that if the sound is at maximum and the parent unit is too close to the baby unit it squeels. We have not had any static. Perhaps some others have interference with their phones or something...?
4855,1,We have been using these diapers since our son was born. He is now 15 months and we are still using them. They are just as good as Pampers or Huggies but without the awful chemicals. Plus I love the fact that they are just plain brown. My baby has gone green!
50206,1,"After having a potty seat that you take on & off the toilet, we finally tried this Potty Pal seat. My almost 4yr old daughter can easily take the proper seat down to go to the bathroom. The childs & adult seat is light & will not come slamming down. They all fit in the seat cover nicely & is not akward as an adult to use. Highly recommend & wish I would have bought this after she outgrew the stand alone potty seat."
105082,0,I HAVE A 7 MONTH OLD AND FOUND THIS PRODUCT GREAT UNTIL SHE STARTED SOLIDS AND THE POOPY GOT STINKIER!!! I ACTUALLY CHANGED MY BABY REGISTRY INTIAL WISH LIST FROM A DIAPER GENIE TO THIS ONE WHEN I DISCOVERED YOU ONLY NEED TO USE TRASH BAGS AND NOT THE COSTLY LESS COST EFFECTIVE REFILLS....HOWEVER 7 MONTHS DOWN THE LINE I AM HEADING TO THE SHOPS FOR A DIAPER GENIE. I USED A DIAPER GENIE WITH MY FIRST CHILD AND NEVER HAD PROBLEMS WITH IT AND USED IT TILL SHE STARTED WEARING REGULAR PANTS. IT IS A PAIN AND COSTLY TO KEEP BUYING REFILLS BUT THEY ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AS THEY INDIVIDUALLY WRAP EACH POOPY DIAPER WHICH CUTS DOWN THE ODOR - AND YEAH! I READ THE LAST REVIEW ABOUT CLEANING THE THING AND AS TIME GOES ON EACH DIAPER PAIL IS LESS EFFECTIVE....BUT I CLEAN MINE AND EMPTY IT AT LEAST 1 TIME WEEKLY AND I DON'T RECALL THIS MUCH EFFORT WITH THE DIAPER GENIE. I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU LIVE IN COOLER CLIMATES....BUT SOUTH FLORIDA'S HEAT IS A NO-NO MIX WITH THIS PAIL
11139,2,"FYI!! This particular bottle is NOT BPA FREE! Not all of Nuby's bottles are BPA Free. Only their ""Polypropylene Line"" of bottles are BPA Free. The packaging will say ""Polypropylene"" bottles. This is the only way you'll know. They won't actually say ""BPA Free"". Very confusing - but these here are not the BPA Free Bottles!!"
174498,1,We started using the mobile immediately as soon as our son came home from the hospital. He is tracking the mobile with his eyes! The pausing in between the rotation is a great idea and it allows him to focus on his favourite item of the day. The volume is a great feature and I like that you can choose a sound to match his mood. A great item to add to your list of things to &quot;calm baby down&quot;.
116355,1,"I get a ton of compliments on this. I bought this one as a gift for someone else, but received a similar looking one (same maker) and it is perfect to attach to my daughters carrier/car seat. From 0-5 months, it provided me easy access to find the pacifier in a hurry, even while driving when I had to reach back and do it blindly. Now after 5 months, she picks it up herself and plays with it & looks at the colors. I can easily detach it from the carrier & re-attach it to her clothes when I take her out of the car. This way she has it with her if she wants it, and it's never falling on the floor. I love it!"
100423,2,"We used the Pampers Swaddlers (NB and Size 1) prior to these. I ordered these thinking they were the next in the Size 2 line; however, our baby is constantly leaking and smells like pee immediately after a diaper change. We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry. Since she is only 13 pounds, there was no need to move her to size 3 as someone recommended. I would think twice before ordering the Baby Dry."
13957,0,"We really liked the bottles initially, and if I had written a review during the first two months I had used the bottles, I would have given them five stars.Unfortunately, and I do not know why, the bottles started leaking. We own nine of them and they ALL leak. No matter how tight we screw on the tops or how we try to secure them on so that there appears to be no gaps, they all leak. It's a drag to get formula all over our clothes and/or our son's clothes. I shouldn't have to put a bib on our son when I feed him with a bottle! If they fall on their side in the diaper bag, it's a huge mess.Everyone we know who uses these bottles has the same problem. I recently had a discussion with two of my sisters in law and they both expressed that they had the same problem, too.I don't know how many people here have had the same problem, however, I believe that there is some defect with the design of the bottles.I am having my second child in five months (I currently have an eight month old). My husband is INSISTING that we get a different brand of bottle for our second child. The leaking problem is very annoying, especially when one considers the cost of the bottles."
91533,2,This monitor started off fine but within 6 months was static all the time- it actually kept my husband up at night. I threw them away and bought Sony monitors. So far they are great! Don't get these!!
92359,1,This product was in good condition and was great to use. It makes bath time easy and more enjoyable and i would recommend this to others.
115055,2,"My doctor prescribed medication that would not allow me to nurse while taking them, so I needed to express to keep my milk supply up. I was hesitant to purchase this pump based on other reviews, but I was despearate and had little choice at the time I could not afford the Medela. It is THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY, and because it is a &amp;quot;personal hygiene item&amp;quot;, I cannot return it. It is LOUD (to me it always sounded like the motor was about to die), the milk gets backed up in the chambers, so you have to stop and break the suction to allow it to drain, the milk also gets sucked under the breast shields. It takes a really long time to express and my breasts were never emptied, they were always just as engorged and painful as before I started pumping. I didn't really mind washing and keeping track of all the little parts (alot more than the medela). I was able to get a Medela, I packed the Evenflo away and have never looked back. Perhaps it would be okay for light/ocassional pumping. But in my opinion it's a piece of junk!!!!!!"
147462,1,"Hello, I purchased this for a new Grandson who has acid reflux and colic and it's turned out to be a blessing for him and my Daughter. It is his favorite seat over 5 of the newest swings and vibrating chairs etc.Worth every penny. I definately recommend to all Moms, Grandmothers, & for wonderful baby gifts. I happily give it at least 5 stars for sure.The delivery & purchase were everything promised.Thank you Amazon, keep up the great work!"
182509,1,This product works great. We have a base installed in each car. This makes it convienient to do drop offs and pick ups.
142982,0,"After the first week of use, the lid broke off. I still use it though because I like the warm wipes. I have also found that the wipes won't stay up to come through the hole and you have to keep opening the whole thing up, then the lid falls off. If you get this item beware of THE LID. Treat it gently, or try another product."
48094,2,I thought I was getting the bags. What I got was a role of plastic with writing on it. Supposedly they are bags you can put into the bottle but I could not understand the directions and don't see how it is possible that they could stay in and hold fluid. They also did not look like the picture here. The box was different. I should have returned it right away but I pulled one out to try and figure out how they worked in the hopes of salvaging my purchase.
64097,2,"The album is nice but it came with rust color spots all over it?? i returned it they sent another with same problem, but only a few spots?? pages very nice with corner tabs so you can use any size pictues."
108830,1,Cradle cap was gone in 2 weeks and significantly reduced after first use! Totally worth the price. I used it withthe Bean-B-Clean Baby scalp massaging brush.
110279,0,"For the ubiquitous nursery glider I did a lot of research. This rocker is like your basic politician, lesser of the available evils. My husband wanted something tall enough for his head to rest back on, so the swivel/armchair gliders [...] I was looking at became a non-option. For the record, my friend has one of these and I love them - all the things that bug my about our glider are fixed with this plush comfy one.This glider is too big for my frame of 5'5"". The seat is too deep and high and the arm rests are too high also. I wish, also, that the microfiber covers were removable and therefore washable. It's in the sort of chintzy style of most items nowadays, unless you pay for a mega upgrade to a piece of furniture that will really last.The plusses are that it's a glider, it's economical, it comes with a footstool (which is a must in my opinion), and it's not forever."
31933,1,"I'm using it for the last month and I ordered another pack recently.The good thing about it is that it is reusable. I can also connect it directly to Medela and Ameda breast-pump.Now when I'm pumping more this things are less useful, because you can pump only 2 oz in the bottle.I'm still keeping milk in them, because it's easy to heat the milk under the water (they are small and tall, so the milk will warm faster).Unfortunately, when you froze the milk, these bottle became quite fragile - one of the bottles fell of in the freezer and cracked. Now I'm keeping them in a box."
112729,1,My daughter gets so excited when I hand her this blanket. She loves to snuggle up with it and fall asleep in her swing. It's so soft and has been washed many times so it's durable too. I would definitely recommend! :)
55123,1,"This has to be one of the better stroller's that I've owned. Nice functionality and comfort for the kids. While it is a little bulky at times, most strollers of this type are. Definitely getting my use out of this and it's such a smooth ride too! =)"
32980,1,This product is just the thing my son needed to be comfortable in his car seat. When we switched from his infant seat to his regular car seat we noticed that when he fell asleep he would slump over due to the car seat being too upright. This made the seat recline just enough for him to be comfortable. I also felt better using this rather than a pool noodle since it is made specifcally for this purpose.
145153,0,"Several of my family members bought this product,and they love it,thier toddlers can explore,while being ""mobile"" they never get board playing with the toys,it keeps them very busy.Great product!"
139655,1,I bought this in hopes that I could put my 1 year old to bed a little more peacefully and my 3 year old thought it was the coolest thing. So now it is used as a nightlight as well as an educational toy to show him the constellations. I thought it would do more but it is excactly what he needed to help him get over his fear of bad dreams at bedtime.
77679,1,"One of the best purchases we have made since having our daughter. We do not use a high chair at home and instead use this chair allowing our daughter to sit at the table with us. She absolutely loves it and we take it with us to restaurants as well, it is super lightweight and portable. Also a bit of advice, buy the ""Tiny Diner"" placemat and you will have the perfect set up :) Save $ and buy this instead of a high chair, trust me :0)"
145295,1,my grandbaby loves just loves this. we had anothere jumper and his foot was pinched. this one is save and vary intertaining.
177868,2,"I don't just find this thing annoying to clean, it's a major pain. After only a couple of uses, it will mildew so you definitely HAVE to hang it up after each and every use. I can throw it in the washer (on hot) with okay results, but since it's see-through, I spend a lot of time cleaning it so I can't see the mildew which drives me nuts (we have a white tub so it really shows up). Also, at least in our tub, it doesn't stick that well. It definitely bunches up and since I remove it after each use, I am constantly trying to get it to stick, to no avail...In my opinion, this is a major drawback, hence the 2 stars."
78253,0,I really like this booster seat. We mainly use it when we go to a restaurant. The only complaint I have is that the strap mechanism stopped working after a few months of use. The straps do not retract. We have been using the seat since our son was 6 months old. He is now 17 months. It is annoying to have the straps hanging when the seat is not in use.
14887,2,"I disagree with some of the other reviewers. I have tried everything and no matter what I do these bottles leak all over my son. If I keep them a little loose, THEY LEAK. If I try to tighten them a little, THEY LEAK! My poor son has been tortured by these bottles long enough. I also did not want to throw them away and waste money. But I could not take it anymore - I threw them away and now use the cheaper and better Playtex bottles. So please moms everywhere, don't use these bottles. Your babies deserve better!"
61014,1,"This is the best diaper pail of all. It wraps the diapers tight and doesn't stink at all. It holds diapers upto 5 to 7 days depending how many diapers your baby uses per day. Good product. Easy to use, once you get the idea."
152380,0,"Even though the cover leaves some openings my daughter was able to use to reach some of the buttons, it was a complete turn off and my daughter is not interested in toying with my DVR anymore."
19171,0,Not a bad sling for the price. We got our use out of it. A big downside is the length (the tail is really short)....especially if you are plus-sized. I could see this being a really nice sling for a very petite woman though.
144150,0,"I ordered this for a friend on-line, I was dissapointed when I finally saw it. You need to step hard on some of the feet in order to get the sound. It needs lights to make it more fun. I would rate this toy as just OK."
122254,0,"I bought this after seeing it on someone and thought it looked adorable. After ordering it and using it myself I was a little disappointed. The material is really soft and comfortable, but the shawl doesn't really do it's job of covering boobs and baby when nursing. The neck is too big and droops down revealing a nursing baby and the sides seem to turn a lot. I like that it covers a lot of the sides, but overall it's not very practical. Other nursing covers seem to work better and unfortunately this one is now just laying in my drawer. I hope to find a use for it this winter."
112691,2,"I tried these diapers for the first time a week and a half ago, and now my son has the most severe rash that I've ever seen. He never had any problems with the normal pampers but as soon as I switched hie broke out. I've been putting cream on him, and that doesn't even help. Luckily he is going to the doctors tomorrow. I wouldn't have even know the cause, had there not been a news story today about this brand causing rashes in lots of babies. I will no longer be using Pampers brand diapers."
143010,1,"at first I thought this was something that would be completely unnecessary, but, I was wrong. this was one of the best inventions. it makes diaper changes so much easier. well, until they start moving around anyway....worth every penny"
125515,1,"My daughter is about to turn 3 and she still loves to carry this around and use in her imaginitive play. She loved it as a teething baby and it is still holding up now. We kept all of her teethers in the door of our freezer, our daughter calls all of them ""freezy toys"" and although the teether has picked up a bit of ""freezer odor"" it is no worse for the wear."
26218,1,I was worried that this travel bag would not be big enough to hold an infant rear facing seat. I was worried it was designed for a toddler size one piece seat. I shouldn't have worried. This bag fit the infant seat PLUS its base. In addition we were able to put our coats into the bag along with the seat at the airport so we didn't have to drag the coats on the plane. I would recommend this bag to anyone who travels with an infant!
90548,1,"We've been using Pampers since she was born. I've tried other brands, but don't like them as much, so we always end back up with Pampers. They go all night without leaking. By size 5, blowouts are rare, but still usually pretty well contained (depending on how active she is before it's discovered). They don't have a heavy scent, are thin, and softer than some other brands."
12866,1,"Granted, I just bought this item and I am 37 weeks pregnant so I can't say how it works earlier on. It took a few minutes to find the heartbeat and I had to turn the sound way up. (I even used it on a full stomach, which it says not to do.) I don't like how you have to hold the button down to hear, it picks up every movement of your fingers and you have to press it onto your belly pretty hard. I bought mine with only 1 headset at Wal-mart and no extras; it was $20, worth the money for the peace of mind."
26854,1,I started wearing this product when I was 3 months pregnant and it has really helped me a lot! I never had any back pain at all while wearing it!!!
24243,0,"The sheet is fine (and softer than other reviewers seem to think, in my opinion), but Amazon.com has some false advertising on this product. I ordered the mini white sheet, and in the product description it says that this is the 100% cotton sheet. (Some of the other colors/sizes say poly/cotton blend, and a few say 100% cotton.) The sheets are NOT the 100% cotton sheets! Arms Reach *does* sell 100% cotton sheets, so I was assuming these were cotton. They are 65% polyester 35% cotton. However, this might help prevent some shrinking issues (although I plan to not put them in the dryer, as per the directions on the tag), and they are soft, so I'm not too upset about. Just wish Amazon would fix the product description!"
146557,1,"This is the best product that I bought for my baby! She loves it so much! Even when she is not in the best of moods, as soon as she sits in here, she just starts laughing and jumping. She also loves the toys on it! It is worth my money just to see her enjoying herself! Not to mention that it keeps her safely occupied for a good 20 minutes at least! It is a great product!"
147733,0,"I expected this car seat to be the best. My major complaints are that the material is hard to clean and the seat is way too narrow. My son is 3 months old and is already squished when in the car seat. He does not like being in it at all. I registered for this car seat because I had heard so many great things about Peg Perego. Now that I have been using mine for a few months, I think a Graco or Evenflo is just as good, as well as half the cost. I am extremely happy with my Peg Perego Pliko stroller but would recommend new parents to go with a Graco or Evenflo for the infant car seat."
112466,1,"Other less expensive brands used to work fine for my son. Now I find that that Pampers is the only brand that really fits his behind. We've had no leaks or blowouts when he wears them, even overnight."
31793,2,"The design of the bag seems adequate. There are plenty of pockets and compartments including the semi-insulated one on the bottom. I am appalled at the low quality of materials. The thread looks like cheap heavy duty polyester thread. Cheap thread makes it fall apart much faster. I would not expect more than 3-6 months use (yes, I am sure it is designed that way), based on my experience with other backpacks. I would be terribly afraid of washing it. What good is baby stuff you can't wash?!? The shoulder straps have terribly inferior padding. The waist strap is not padded.Overall, very disappointing for the price point. It's going back."
69216,2,"I have been using Pampers for my daughter since the day she was born. I sware by the Pampers brand name. Unfortunately, their new ""mesh"" lining may have caused my now two year old daughter a visit to the emergency room. As it turns out my daughter suffered a serious abrasion to her groin which bled. It was an absolute horrible experience for me and my baby who had to suffer from excruciating pain and discomfort. The ER doctor advised me from staying away from these diapers for the next couple of weeks. Needless to say - we ended up buying Huggies. I've always trusted Pampers and hope that they will remove the mesh lining as soon as possible."
125036,2,"The seat is set up where you slip two metal bars threw the material to make the top shape, but there is nothing to keep the bars from sliping around, so as the child is jumping the bar is moving making an akward shape which sometimes will move the straps in front of the child or in weird places."
88397,1,The seat covers stay in place and are a great incentive for my 2 year old to try the potty.
144161,0,"When I ordered the Busy Bee playmat, I did not pay attention to the size of the playmat. I just thought it was a great playmat for my baby to lie on and play.Unfortunately, when it arrived, it was much smaller than I imagined, and there was no way my baby could lie and crawl on it! So now I use it folded in a triangle shape, and my baby plays with it in the car! It is soft, and colorful, with many textures to play with.I still had to buy a other playmat where my baby can now exercise his crawling skills!"
70537,0,"When I opened this box and saw the rocker in 20 pieces, I gasped and put the box back into the closet. My husband however put it together a few days later and said it was easy. It didn't look easy to me but I am not exactly handy. Anyway to make a long story short, it's ugly but the baby seems to really enjoy it. It seems sturdy too. It gets 3 stars because of the cheap price."
90726,1,"I absolutely love these diapers! My daughter is 13 months old now and I cannot think of more than 1 or 2 times these have ever leaked. Even when she sleeps through the entire night and wakes up soaked, they hold an enormous amount of liquid!I tried the cruisers once, now that my daughter can run around, but I like the baby dry still. I find that the stretchy waistbands allow the diaper to fall down when she's active, but maybe that's not the case with everybody. Since these are looser around the stomach they also seem more comfortable, and my daughter doesn't rip them off immediately like some of the other stretchy brands."
40803,1,"Our baby is a Pampers baby. Only problem I have noted is that Pampers diapers don't always hold up well for overnight especially if you child will sleep 10 hours straight. Otherwise, my husband and I are quite happy using Pampers."
81440,1,"I would rate this higher than 5 stars if possible! I registered for this stroller because I wanted something lightweight (that I could lift and that didn't take up a lot of space). This one only weighs 9 lbs. My friend who bought it for me as a gift complimented me on the price (only $40). I have had this stroller for four years, and have used it with all three of my kids since they were born. I am always getting compliments on this stroller. It is as compact as an umbrella stroller, with the amenities of a very nice stroller, with the cargo basket, sun shade, recline position, parent tray with two cupholders, and removeable child's tray with cupholder. Since I have an older model, mine does not accomodate a car seat, which I didn't want at the time but later realized is a nice feature. I've always had to wake up my baby to move him from the car to the stroller. Also, when I first got my stroller, the parent tray didn't fit. I called the manufacturer and they sent me a new one, which also didn't fit. I took it in to Babies R Us, and the sales person took the tray off the display model and it fit just fine. I heartily recommend this stroller to everyone - I really love mine and will use it as long as I can!"
35559,1,"I use this on every trip to the grocery (I forgot it once so I didn't go!) and when we aren't using our strap on booster high chair, we use it over top the restaurant high chairs. It's sanitary, safe (strap the seat strap through the cart or chair's back), comfortable in wet, hot or cold carts, and keeps my very active and strong daughter comfy.(I began using it at 4 1/2 mos- afer she grew out of the ""carry car seat"". She's now 1 year.) Whether they teethe on the straps, covered cart handle or bang their head on the back or sides of the cart/chair... your're covered... literally! It washes and dries easily/ quickly. THE new shower gift for ALL new mom's who don't yet know they need it!"
182366,1,"Purchased as a gift to fit the changing table made by Grandpa to be. Love that the sides are higher so baby will be safe while new parents learn the ropes! Great price, fast service. I highly recommend this seller."
86497,1,My daughter says that it has VERY clear sound quality and the picture is great. I would recommend this product and seller both.
57807,2,"While it did warm the wipes, it has some problems. I noticed that the wiring was flaky; it was plugged in, but not warming. I had to reposition where the power cord sat and it was fine. It seems to easily come off the organizer. Ours dropped once and one of the posts that makes the lid hinge broke. Depending how you have the diapers in the organizer, trying to take one out could send the rest to the floor. Overall, something I could do without."
45087,1,"We bought some extra animals to hang on this. I don't like to listen to the music, but the mirror is great and my son loves the toys. Easy to take with you..."
155001,1,"easy to put together, nice wood for price, drawers don't have catch to stop them from closing, but otherwise nice dresser."
3140,2,"This product did help my 5 mo old sleep better, as she cannot move her arms around and kick her feet which wakes her up. However it ripped very soon after we got it, around the velcro patch in the center. You are supposed to pull the left part down and velcro it to the middle patch on the babies lower abdomen area. Well there are holes that are growing larger and larger each time we use it. It could have been made with higher quality stitching and material."
99525,1,I have been using pampers for past one year and I find it very reliable . I tried other brands but I found pampers best among all.
155528,1,"I ordered these sheets after trying a number of others on our LA Baby crib mattress and having no luck- all had pockets that were too shallow. These sheets not only fit with a little room to spare (even after washing/drying), but are soft enough for baby's skin. Great sheets for the money! I ordered two more."
47803,1,"Used this on my son and it's great enough as baby powder, but would you believe it's also a great dry shampoo? When I have to go out and have no time to shower, I sprinkle some of this in my hair and it soaks up the oil. Give it a few minutes, shake it out, and I'm good to go! Doesn't leave me smelling like powder, either."
161548,2,"I put this tub on my registry before reading the reviews written about it. If I had known that so many were going to be bad, I would've chosen something else. It did do its job for several months, but the weirdest thing happen last night as I was bathing my son. He was sitting in the tub with his elbow resting on the ring. He arm slid down against the plastic ring and he started crying. When I looked down to see what happened, I noticed that the &quot;plastic&quot; ring took off some skin and he was bleeding. After that happened, I threw out the tub, and now am looking for one that is more efficiently designed. Possibly a Snug Tub."
93383,1,Bought this about 2 years ago...best purchase ever to protect the back of my seats. I cant tell you how much dirt ends up on these protectors and not on my seats! Easy to wipe down or hose off!
155703,1,"Perfect size, easy to clean. Love the non-spill feature. All my animals now prefer this dish over their usual water dish!"
51734,1,I bought this swing for my god son and it has been a lifesaver. He was a very fussy little one and this swing always seemed to calm him. The music and the fact that it can be plugged in was a plus.
177094,1,"We bought this gate 3 years ago when our youngest child began crawling. We needed it for the top of our stairs, which had a metal banister that was hard to connect a gate to securely. So, we needed a gate that would be straight next to the banister then bend to meet the wall beyond the stair landing. This is the only one I found that worked for such a project. Now, we will be using it in a different house to go across the landing of our tri-level home, to block off two stairways for our second child. It certainly is adaptable. I only wish there were smaller extensions available. Still, I highly recommend this product for hard-to-secure areas."
11988,1,"I will give this review 5 stars because I love the product. However, I can't buy the replacements here. I wanted 5 replacement packs, total would be less than eight dollars...and the shipping charge is almost 25 bucks!! That is outrageous. They don't even weigh anything. I think something needs to be adjusted here."
24199,1,"I love this swing and the pretty print...perfect for a little girl! I like all the features such as the different speeds, music and mobile. My daughter likes to look at the mobile while she swings. The motor does make noise while swinging..but then again don't they all? I don't think it's too loud though. The only problem we've encountered is when the swing was on & no matter which setting it was on, the mobile would end up swinging itself towards the back where the baby can't see it anymore, it took a while but after messing around with it for about the 20th time I figured out the problem, it wasn't turned far enough to the front left side, I was always scared to turn it further thinking I would snap the arm, but once I finally did it it was fixed and has stayed put ever since. I think the only reason the arm ever moved was because one of my older kids would play with it and move it around. I think taking the arm off the swing and reattaching it (like just out of the box directions) would've fixed it too. All in all I love the swing and wouldn't switch it for another. I would also recommend it to anyone with a baby girl because of the lovely print...just don't be afraid to adjust the mobile arm all the way to the left (almost touching the part that connects legs) if it gets whacked out of place!"
20283,0,Originally received these bottles as a gift for my newborn. Hated them from the beginning due to their many parts that needed to be washed. Used said bottles up until my daughter was 10 months with many nipple replacements. Recently bought a new pack of the same bottles and within 3 days the bottoms begin to leak. Love the vent air technology but hated the hassle involved with these bottles.
48605,0,"I have the Zanzibar valances and lamp in my son's room so I was excited to recieve this bedding. I live in Michigan and our winters are cold. I was hoping the comforter blanket would have been thicker and warmer. It is a thin fleece blanket with a cute design. Great for fall and spring, but I question if it is warm enough for winter. The sheet is clever. It is fitted on one side so that it cannot ride up or be kicked off. I like that given I often have to tuck my 2 year old in again after he falls asleep. The design does have a lot going on but it is cute for a little one."
95971,1,Best night sleep in a LONG time!! This pillow is great and I'm not even pregnant. It comforts your body so that you can get pure rest.
3074,2,"I was reluctant to invest in a blanket specifically for swaddling, but after a few weeks of making due with regular blankets, I tried the SwaddleMe wrap. While it is reasonably priced, cute and easy to use, my little guy found it easy to ""escape"", both from the size-appropriate blanket, and from the smaller size. I just couldn't keep his arms secure or tightly wrapped. Swaddling at night makes all the difference for my baby, so I'll continue to do it, but I'm back to my low-tech system: receiving blanket and tape."
6661,1,I recently bought a couple packs of Huggies after seeing they were much cheaper than Pampers and I really miss the Pampers! They have a pleasant smell to them and are much softer than other diapers but still very functional.
99784,1,Great Product to have for our babyShe is enjoying a lot with more comfort all the timeWe recommend this product highly
32910,0,I decided to wean my son directly from breast to cup instead of breast to bottle to cup. He can't hold the handles very well because they move so much. The cup would be so much better if they were attatched to the cup. Other than that I love the spout and everything else.
125510,0,"This teether is ok, but not as great as I thought. My baby tries to suck on it more like a soother rather then crew like a teether and only gets mad! I feel it sends more mixed signals, but may be a good option for people looking for a way to wean their baby from a soother!"
141047,2,"Flimsy! We had one handed down to us from another family. I retired it after the 2nd time spilling food all over due to its poor design. First spill -- top plate pops off -- apparently the installation of the top plate is very particular. 2nd spill -- the bottom plunger action is sticky and doesn't have a 'stop' before coming all the way out the bottom.Doing a quick search on ""food mill"" I see that regular kitchen food mills start at round $20, going up to $70. I can't imagine a real food mill being of this shoddy."
133464,1,"We've tried lots of bottles, and all leak except these. Love that they are safe. Easy to clean too compared others (get the bottle brush they sell too), a big bonus. Baby likes them too!"
109792,0,"I purchased this bed rail after reading that it is a universal bed rail and doesn't need to be used with a box spring. I thought it would be perfect for using with our son's twin mattress that is on a bunkie board. Unfortunately, it did not work and I had to return it. So although it appears durable and sturdy I only gave it 3 stars since it didn't meet its description of being able to work without a box spring."
8241,0,This thing is MUCH bigger than I expected and I am still on the fence as to whether I will keep it...
149800,1,"We bought one of these 2 years ago for my oldest daughter and bought a second one in May of this year for our youngest. I do not find them flimsy at all. They withstand drawing, eating, having a juicebox on it, pulling it (because ""she has mine!""), and all sorts of things. I originally bought it in order to have a flat surface to play with toys and color on. It has been GREAT for that. Also, now my oldest does her schoolwork on it-when we're in the car during school time. It is also perfect for eating. I have not had a problem with it sitting at an angle on either of my kids. It might depend on where the armrests are on the carseat? One more thing...we recently discovered that they work great without connecting them to the kids, too. My kids just use them until they are done, then put them on the floor below their feet when they are done. Or we have also attached the strap between the carseat and the child-making it easy for the child to undo the clasp when they are done. I love the pockets for storage..which we mostly use for crayons. In summation, I love these and would highly recommend them!"
21001,1,"This product was great. The footprint kit was so easy, and it just has to dry for a good day, and then its ready to frame. definatly reccomend this product."
59867,1,"We had a Fisher-Price baby bathtub that someone gave us. It had a mesh sling in it to use when the baby couldn't be submerged yet. That aspect of it was nice, but when we started putting our son down in the water, he was moving all over the place and sliding down a lot. We used the F-P tub for about 4 months.I checked bathtub reviews inBaby Bargains: Secrets to Saving 20% to 50% on baby furniture, gear, clothes, toys, maternity wear and much, much more!(a great book to get to research baby gear) and found this bathtub. It is the best! It has guides for the baby's arms and legs and a crotch post to keep him/her from sliding down. Our son was comfy and in a reclined position. When he didn't want to be laying down for baths anymore, we switched him to the other side where he could comfortably sit up and play. We used this up until recently when we started putting our son straight in the big bathtub.For a long time, we used this on our bathroom counter. At some point, we started putting this tub inside our bathtub. He is 18 months now so we probably used it for about 14-15 months.Pros:-nice supports and guides to keep your wee babe from sliding all over the place-sunken areas for storing soap/shampoo-bigger area for older babies-recommended use for up to age 2-drainage holeCons:-BIG. This tub is huge-we had some issues with leaking from the drainage hole, but it was very little water so we just wiped it up when we were finished with a bath. It was about a tablespoon of water each time."
139966,0,"Once you put this together, it is not adjustable which makes it hard to store. You can fold the outside legs/stands but that's it; it does not slide to become compact."
108225,2,"This was a complete waste of $50. There is barely any suction, and what little there is disappears after 2 or 3 pumps. We have washed it, tried using different valves/silicon pieces, and taken it apart and put it back together countless times. It is absolutely awful. I am writing the company a letter and also informing both pregnancy groups I'm in about the problems with this product. Avoid this pump! It is not at all what it is cracked up to be!"
39041,2,I bought these for my 12lb infant and found that they did not breath or fit very well and leaked right away. They were too big and did not hold the cloth diaper at all. The cloth diaper fell apart under the cover even with the use of snappies holding them on. Also the legs holes seemed to be cut too low compared to the rise and my infant has chunky thighs and the elastic leg holes pinched his skin too much. I do not recommend these and would recommend a fitted diaper cover with velcro so it can conform to your babies shape.
127346,1,"I'm all about getting my money.s worth and this definitely is. It's easy to assemble, took my husband about an hour. I love how I can use it for several more years. It comes with the half side rail and some extra screws, so I'm assuming you'll need to purchase more pieces for the full size bed."
34045,0,"I've just returned from a trip to Europe on which I used this bag to carry a Graco high-back booster seat. It was used on a total of six flights and got progressively more ripped on each stage of the journey. It now has five rips in it, three of which go all the way through to the interior. Childress say that they guarantee their products 100%; however, damage caused by airlines is not covered. Well really, what damage are you going to have inflicted on a travel car seat bag except damage caused by airlines? Childress need to use a much sturdier, rip-resistant material so that this product is actually fit for purpose. I doubt whether we will be able to use this on more than a couple more trips due to the damage it has already undergone.This bag is a great idea, but it could be so much better..."
15308,2,I wish I had seen these reviews about a week ago. :( I have the rash as well. . .
23351,0,"I was looking for a way to transport my 9-month old when I had drop off my 3 year old at preschool, but remain hands-free. This fit the bill for that, but definitely has some drawbacks. I had a hard time finding a comfortable position for me and my baby - she was always too low so her face was in my chest...I probably just need to spend more time on finding the right position. Once in though - it does allow you to be hands free which was my original goal. The other problem I think I'm about to run into is I live in Ohio and winter is coming...not sure how this is going to operate over a coat - and will probably need to keep adjusting depending on what coat I'm wearing... The other thing I'm starting to think is that when my baby is walking - not too far off, I probably wouldn't use this at all...So in the end, kind of an expensive item for short-term limited use."
8410,1,"Purchased this product for the edge of our fireplace and the underside of our metal base, glass top coffee table. It's easy to install and we've had no problems with the edges coming off, yet. If they do, we'll just reapply or buy stronger double-sided tape. Also purchased the elastic padded bumber, but even the small was too big for our coffee table and I don't sew (as some reviews suggested). The foam edges have worked just fine. Great invention that give us piece of mind and our son added safety while he plays in the living room."
164271,1,"The pampers baby dry are very good diapers, as they hold a ton of moisture, but sometimes don't do very well with semi-solids..When you have moist #2's, they seem to become a mess quick with these (smear on the legs, etc.), but again, to me it's a decent trade off, since in most situations these are far better than the competition. I definitely recommend them, especially if you have a baby who pees a lot in his/her sleep, as they are the ONLY diapers that seem to hold up to heavy amounts of pee without leaking all over the place..."
114420,1,"When I registered for this when I was pregnant, some of my friends told me that it wouldn't really work as my main feeding chair for my son. I decided to try it out for myself before going the traditional high chair route. My son is 9 months old now, and I have absolutely NO REGRETS for getting this chair. I started giving my son solids at 5 months when he was first able to sit up independently. I didn't need to ""cushion"" the chair in any way. He always seemed very comfortable in it. The other more expensive ""space saver"" highchairs also seem like a waste of money to me. It's so easy to strap him in and just pop the tray on top. We love having him sit with us on the table and eat while we do. If he was in a bigger high chair, I would have to stand up all the time to feed him. But with this, I can sit next to him and feed him.I received the ""deluxe"" edition before I saw this one and I recommend the basic one instead. The cover that comes with the deluxe edition is useless, I put it away and never used it. And the extra tray is also not useful, because I usually end up washing both pieces together anyway. It's very easy to clean. I also have seen lots of people complain about the other space saver high chairs that have straps that go across the shoulders. The straps will definitely get dirty and are very hard to remove and clean. With this one, the straps go around the waist and under the table, so they never get dirty.I love this so much I bought one for my mom's house. I look forward to using it through his toddler years, and later, when we can remove the table and bring him closer to our dining table.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
66295,0,"The suction cup on the bottom for these bowls is great(only one is included, you have to switch it when you want to use a different bowl). However it is REALLY hard to put the lids on, so I don't recommend using them for anything but feeding."
82300,1,"I followed the suggestions by previous reviewers, and it worked! Call 1-800-435-8316, press 0 and ask for replacement tubing. They ship it for free! Happy Pumping!"
109089,1,"This is a great stroller! My husband and I searched long and hard trying to find a good stroller that had all the amenities we wanted with a good price tag. Finally I found this one. I love the mosquito net, and the canopy is large to shield the baby from the sun. The seat reclines all the way back for a small infant. The basket underneath is large and there are 2 cupholders for the parents. It seems to be very sturdy and is easy to fold and unfold, and you can turn it easily with one hand or two. Our hand-me-down Discovery car seat that is a few years old also fits into it. The only minor drawback is it is a little heavier than some lightweight strollers, but the other features definitley outweigh that. I haven't actually tried this out as our baby hasn't been born yet, but I am sure our baby will love it as well."
35937,2,"**UPDATE**I love this type of wrap for the reasons I explain in my original review, below, but I have found a better wrap that does not have the problem I had with the Ultimate Baby Wrap, which was that it would get loose and cause my baby to hang too low. The Sleepy Wrap is made of much better material that stays taut and supports your baby much better!**ORIGINAL REVIEW**The ultimate baby wrap is so easy to throw on for errands and pop my daughter in and out at each stop. On a recent trip I wore it all weekend and it was so nice and easy. My shoulders did start getting sore after wearing my baby for several hours, but she is 22 pounds and I usually don't wear her that long anyway. I love the pocket. I put my keys and cell phone in there when we go out for a walk. The only drawback is that after a few wearing sessions it stretches out and my baby hangs low, but I just wash and dry it to get it snug again. Not sure if I'm supposed to wash AND dry it, but I do regularly and it's held up well for a long time. Just recently I did notice it tearing a bit where the pocket is sewn on. When I wear my baby it does stretch that area quite a bit, and like I said I wash and dry it a lot which isn't that great for any fabric."
69862,1,"I have yet to have one of these diapers leak. They are great for my 8 month old and my *very* active 2 year old. If they are cutting into your childs legs or leaking, I would assume you need a larger size, because I have never had a problem, and they are cheaper than the premium brands! Highly recomended"
46380,2,"I bought this play yard so I could get some chores done, cook dinner and leave the living room to go to the bathroom (which isn't far I can see living room from bathroom). I haven't managed to get much done at all and I am still being followed to the bathroom even after putting my 13 month old in his play pen. I followed all the instructions and got the extra links so he could have even more room but its worthless. If he isn't climbing over it then he climbs under it and just for fun he pushes it all over the house. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I saved all our Christmas and birthday money because I thought it would be a good investment since it is so tall and would hopefully last awhile. The gate is made of light plastic with some strips across the middle that helps my little one flip over the top when he climbs up, he sticks his little toes into the holes all over the gate to get to the middle then launches himself over head first. I think they should have made vertical slats like how cribs are, so he has no where to stick his toes in to help him climb. I personally think this gate is a safety hazard and i can't believe it was approved. I don't know what to do now as I have an ineffective gate, I'm out over $100.00, I can't get anything done (even use the bathroom), and both my husband and I are part of the 12% California unemployed but desperately searching for work (which is hard to look for jobs when your child is ripping out the cords to your computer). Sorry for the rant but I am seriously angry and they aren't answering my calls. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GATE SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET SOMETHING HEAVIER, AND STURDIER WITH VERTICAL SLATS unless you like going to the E.R. often with a child with a head injury. I have had to go a few times but thank god only minor issues. I no longer use the gate because of how dangerous it is. BTW it says can be used for children up to 24 months, mine is only 13 months.The one good thing about the gate is the latch it works great."
167439,2,I decided the 'hooter hider' was too expensive and opted for this. Big mistake. It didn't work well for me at all. The difficult to use design and dark material are not user/baby friendly. Booo!
7869,0,"The pee deflector does pop right off. My son promply put it on his head! (before using the potty). My husband super-glued it on and now it's fine. It's better than another potty I bought (after the deflector came off this one), the other deflector was too small and pee went everywhere. So we went back for this one. Elmo's voice is a bit annoying, we're taking the batteries out."
62949,0,"I used this pillow for a good portion of my pregnancy...it worked better than a body pillow but I think it is for shorter women. I couldn't have it between my legs and under my head at the same time. Also, if you change position during the night it is very difficult to do without a lot of re-positioning."
150250,2,"When I saw this, I was very excited. However, since my pad is raised on four sides, rather than two, it did not fit properly and I have to return it. What a bummer! I can't find a change pad cover that will fit my pad, so I guess I will have to go without."
81525,2,"If you want this to help listen for your child to keep them safe, they will most likely die before you ever hear them with this pile of crap monitor. My family bought this for our second child after our old monitor went out after 3 years of good service. We were only able to hear two things with this death machine, static or complete silence, though I don't know if a person can hear complete silence. Save your money and buy a different monitor, I recommend at least Fisher Price monitor that broadcast in the 900 or better range."
116325,1,"I read reviews before buying and decided upon this one because of the angle of the baby and the angled sides made me feel more secure that my baby would not fall off. I have a 2 year old and a 6 month old. I have been using this table for 6 months and it has held up great. My 2 year old is over 30 lb. and he fits on it. I found baskets that fit the 2 middle shelves PERFECTLY!!!! They are the Seagrass V-Weave Basket (LARGE) from World Market. I can get 2 weeks worth of diapers and wipes for both my kids in one basket and the other one I put blanket, rags, and clothes I need on hand. Love this table, just wish I would of bought it when my first child was born."
112795,2,"Although this is a cute suitcase for toddlers, it is way too SMALL. I decided to keep it for my granddaughter to use for her doll clothes since it would cost almost as much to send it back. Picture definitely appears larger than actual product."
156351,1,"My daughter is in a 3T for clothes, but the 2T-3T sleep sack is too small for her to sleep in without her feet poking out and getting cold. Went up a size and it's fabulous! Still very soft and warm after a handful of washes, and I love the purple. I'm just not sure what we're going to do when it's time to start night-time potty training... but at least she's sleeping well for now!"
5119,1,"Great product however I am unhappy with my order service. I updated my automatic delivery for two boxes per month. But I was sent three boxes instead and billed for three. Now I have more than I need and have to pay more than I was prepared for this month. How did this happen and can anyone fix it? I don't want three boxes again next month! I will appreciate a response, Thankyou."
123472,1,"This playpen is great, it has the side mesh to play with and plenty of room for your baby to roll around. My son loves it and he's been using it since he was 6 months old.I would highly recommend this to any mom that wants their child be learn how to sit and explore on their own in a safe and spacious place."
93848,1,I bought this to make my play yard more roomy. My granddaughter loves playing in her new roomy play yard. I would buy this again and highly recommend it.
49308,1,"We just got a new puppy Chihuahua and he loves it! We keep it in our kitchen for when we can't watch him or have to leave the house. It's big enough for us to keep his crate, bed, puppy pad and toys for when we're not home and still has prenty of room for him to play. We don't have to worry about him tearing up the house. It's pretty easy to open and close once you get used to how it works. Would definitely recommend."
121806,2,"In order for boppy pillow to suppot uYour hand and baby correctly you need to always be sitting cross legged. It fit my waist properly but is higher in center and flat on the sides due to which it did not support my hands well.Also for feeding 8-10 times a day and for 1-1.5 hrs per feed, sitting cross legged is extremly painful. Will not recommend for chair/ sitting on bed feeds.I ended up having pain in legs and hand muscles using the boppy"
99131,2,I was a new mom and therefore pretty tired. I didn't notice that there was a difference between baby dry and swaddlers and accidentally bought baby dry. They are more plastic and didn't seem to let my baby's skin breathe nearly as well as the swaddlers. I won't buy the baby dry again!
96275,2,"I love Nuby bottles - they are excellent - but this straw based sippy cup is aweful. The straw is soft but the hole is too small for liquid to flow adequately. As an adult, even I had to use way too much suction force to get any liquid through the straw....do not buy....."
115382,1,"Has been very helpful. So much better than having an additional potty in our already small bathroom. Now she can use the 'big girl potty' with her favorite character, Dora. And it fits neatly in the bathroom cabinet for out of site storage."
137692,1,"I bought this for my almost 18 month old son, to help with sleep training. I didn't realize it turned off after 45 minutes. Since he is in a crib, I can't put it anywhere near him (don't want to put it in the crib) for him to turn back on. However, for him, it doesn't seem to be an issue. I can also turn it on if I have to go in his room to check on him and it doesn't wake him up. The fact that the starts don't move is great--it's not distracting--it's rather soothing.When it's not bed time, he loves to play with the turtle. He has gotten attached to it, even though the shell is hard and not soft! This was a great addition to our bedtime routine."
179265,0,"My baby was taking forever to drink a bottle from the stage 1 nipples. But, then I called the manufacturer and they told me the baby had to put pressure with his mouth closer to the tip of the nipple-that's what makes it flow. If they are latched on too far, towards the base of the nipple it won't flow right. The flow was much faster when I tried it this way, but it seems a little akward for the baby to suck on the tip and for me to hold it this way. I think the air bubbles are definitely reduced with this bottle. The different little parts to this bottle are sort of a pain but not too bad to clean. I have not had any leaking with this bottle and no leaking from around my baby's mouth (like I did with Avent)"
63823,2,"I bought this stroller a couple months ago when our son was two months old. I researched this stroller and the upper weight limit would allow us to keep this stroller for quite some time so we were excited about the investment. Now, my son is 4 months old, 16 + pounds, and 90% in height and weight. He is not fat, just a big guy. I adjusted the waist straps to their full length and noticed that they were tight around my son's waist and seemed to start to poke him. I don't want him to experience this discomfort as well as any internal injuries.Also, the canopy is a joke. We take walks at various times of the day and it only works when the sun is overhead. Well, it is common knowledge that when the sun is overhead, this is the time of the day of the most dangerous and intense sun, so why would I want to be outside then?Bottom line: Thank goodness for Babies R Us return policy. Other than these 2 major flaws, the other features are great, but if I cannot fit my son comfortably and safely in it, talking about other features is moot.My advice: Buy a stroller that has more adjustments to the harness."
126924,1,"I know every baby tends to use different diapers - some people swear by Luvs or Pampers, but Huggies have fit all FOUR of my children best. I bought these diapers using Amazon Mom, and got a great deal (only $0.15 each!). Keep an eye out for special deals like this - it will save you a bunch of money in the long run!"
11351,2,"I just bought this monitor yesterday, and as soon as we plugged it in the staic just went wild! I thought ok maybe it was something going on last night but nope again it is all STATIC. It is very VERY ANNOYING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHEN YOU BUY A PRODUT YOU EXPECT IT TO WORK. I ACCEPT THAT THING'S HAVE PROBLEMS BUT THIS THING IS HORRIBLE! I AM SO DISAFATISFIED RIGHT NOW I HAD TO LET OTHER PARENT'S/CAREGIVERS KNOW HOW BAD THIS PRODUCT IS. Now dont get me wrong I buy nothnig but Fisher Pirce so I am not someone who just bought something from the company for the 1st time, and I have to say Bad move on Fisher price for marketing this because now I wont buy anything from them again. Just to be safe."
23570,1,I am happy with these gates so far i have ordered 2 gates and 3 of the extension pieces to go along with them the build quality is strong and the gates are heavy not light so there built good .my daughter is 8 months old and she wiggle's them and does anything she can to try to get through and i feel totally comfortable relying on the gates because they are sturdy and well made .ordered two more gates but have to wait because amazon is sold out but we knew that when we ordered them . but our first two gates came in quick and on time. we order things through amazon all the time and never had a complaint about it yet .we also have to Two large dogs both Black Lab Size and they to do not get through the gates .

54999,1,"We purchased this after our 2 year old refused to use the potty as she became too tall for it. We had bought another duck-themed one (from Walmart) which didn't fit our elongated toilet seat at all and the first time our daughter climbed on it, it slipped and she went splash.We bought this one after reviewing all the ones available online. We liked the idea of a character but didn't like any of the characters available - plus some reviews stated that they didn't necessarily fit elongated toilet seats.We chose this one because a reviewer said it fit their elongated toilet seat - and hurrah it fits ours.This is now known as the ""wee duck"" in our house and it has really helped my daughter with her potty training - she is attracted to the duck character and can also sit comfortably on it without the seat moving at all.It would have been nice if it came with a little hook for sticking to the wall but that's easily bought at the local home depot / supermarket. The plastic loop at the top makes it easy to hang on a hook that you buy yourself.My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that one of the times my daughter was messing about on the seat, she managed to lift the flexible yellow plastic bit on one side and then get her fingers stuck under it. It's only happened once and was because she was wriggling and playing as she wasn't sure she wanted to go. Just something to be aware of.I do really like this seat and think it's really working to help us attract our daughter to using the potty - and increased her interest in ducks although hopefully she doesn't try and wee on any others!"
82152,1,the adhesive strips are nice for holding things in place while you get everything screwed on.
178614,1,"I absolutely lived with this carrier and used it for both of my children. It worked well with them facing inwards and later outwards. It was a little awkward, but did the job for nursing. The freedom that comes with this carrier is priceless!"
82651,1,"I am so glad I got the travel size sheep! The sound is loud enough for regular use in baby's crib when home, but the smaller size makes it easy to take along in the stroller or when going out of town. I find the best sound to be ""ocean,"" which is white noise."
14611,2,"Who on this planet has nipple like these?! They were a trick to get my son to properly latch onto. The milk has been leaking steadily out of his mouth while feeding since birth!! I thought all bottles did this! My wet clothes and rags can testify! They are just too stiff. I have had the leaking problems also. Every where we go - I have taken premixed bottles and warmed them while out - but they have leaked in the diaper bag, in my purse and in my hand. I have taken sep. containers of formula and water and mixed when he is ready to feed = still flying formula everywhere and it's getting annoying and embarrassing. We have switched to Dr. Brown's."
162848,1,"This is one of the best products out there. This is a necessity in my book. My little ones love it too. I am happy because they get a snack anytime, anywhere, without the mess. They are happy because this is something they are able to do for themselves, and get a tasty treat. Only wish is to have more feminine choices."
44092,1,Our son loves water and we used to take our hands under the faucet and direct the water towards him. He would giggle and loved it. This faucet cover directs the water out like a waterfall and he loves sit half under it to feel the water and he opens his mouth too! The dispenser on the top is for bubble bath or soap and it doesnt hold much so we actaully dont use that part. We have a standard faucet with the lift knob on the top to turn on the shower head and it fits just fine! I am very happy with this! We bought the Kiwi color and it is great!
29258,1,"This stool is the perfect size. We use it in the bathroom for our 3 year old daughter. She used to use it to get on the potty, but now she only uses it to reach the sink. It is small enough that we don't have to move it when we need to use the sink, but big enough for her to stand on with out falling off."
138895,0,I ordered this ladybug for my daughter's birthday as she'd seen her friend's turtle and loved it. The product itself was adorable and worked really well - until two of the three lightbulbs broke so that it could only project one color. We've yet to be able to find the right replacement bulbs and there is no way to identify them easily. I hope other people have had better luck as it really is a great item when it works.
166150,1,I have twin granddaughters. We were extremely please with the Pampers Swaddlers until the formula was changed and the dry max was added. The girls' skin reacted poorly to the new formulation. So the hunt was on for a replacement. The Baby Dry does not have the new formulation... as long as it is not changed we will continue to use the baby dry!!!. The diapers are roomy and fit well and there have been no leak incidents. We long for the day that dry max goes away!!!!!!!!!!
97800,2,"I was using DR. Browns bottles but I quickly found out I needed more. So I purchased Ventaire, I was disapointed and confused by it's design. My baby couldn't get enough milk from the nipples so I went out and bought a bigger size, he still wasn't satasfied. I use them for storage now. I never used other bottles besides Dr. Browns so these could be excellent...BUT I found Dr. Browns work a lot better, are less likely to break and are around the same price."
152264,0,"I really did not use it much because my son did not like it, but it viberated very well under the mattress."
82483,1,"I absolutely love this pack and play. My husband and I originally received a Baby Trend pack and play and after 2 hours of trying to put it together - we got frustrated, took it back, and got this one. I can easily put it together by myself in under 5 minutes. The construction is very well done and takes a beating. I think the unit that has the music and night light is really neat. It comes with a remote control so that you can activate it from across the room and also has a setting where whenever the baby cries, it will automatically turn on, play music, and vibrate. So nice!I use this every day to let my baby sleep in while I am working around the house. Definetly worth the money and I feel I get my use out of this every day."

137019,2,"I should have heeded the bad reviews. I don't understand how this blanket has any good ones. My best guess is that the quality has changed drastically. This blanket was amazingly cheap, scratchy, thin and had threads hanging off of it... I feel terrible that someone spent so much buying this for me from my registry. Its not worth more than five dollars, for the green to cost thirty seven PLUS shipping is just insulting. It claims to be 100% cotton but feels like polyester so either its misrepresented or the lowest thread count possible."
133260,0,I have the regular double pump medela breastpump. I only buy this kit to use at work for the hospital pump. I love the hospital pump because it is a better pump grade overall. However the milk leaks into the lines unlike the ones I have at home. I'm not sure whether mine is a lemon or what. But I just find it too hassle to return it because then I would have to bring my own pump to work while waiting for the new kit to arrive.
18639,0,"I really think Little Tikes should take out the fact that it can be used as a jogging stroller. If you are buying it for THAT, go with a B.O.B. or something similar. This is really a bike trailer. As a trailer, it's really sturdy, roomy, and fits my 3 & 5 year old boys fine. I always thought the 3rd wheel attachment was in case you HAD to push this thing for a minute, similar to a ""spare tire."" I had no idea it was being advertised as a jogging stroller. It's bulky & not easy to get in and out of your car on a regular basis,etc."
23760,1,"We love this thing, it is easy to install (I had to cut it down to fit our 4 inch thick table, but that was easy), and easy to clean.No high chair to walk around or clean around.We have two at home (one for guests), one at my in-laws and my aunt and uncles, who we visit often!"
86092,1,"You have total peace of mind seeing your baby safe. The range is outstanding. I suggest the Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8"" Screen for every baby. The picture is clear. Good for night-time. They should give one to every baby as they leave the hospital."
77025,1,"I really love this swing and so does my daughter. She's two months old and this is her favorite toy. the only thing is the speed of the swing, on the lowest setting it still seems like its going too fast. For this swing to be from birth- on up I think they should have slowed it down a little bit. Other then that I would recommend the Papasan Cradle Swing Collection to everybody. The pink is so cute and girly- fit for a princess!!"
162585,2,I had this tub with my first child it was ok for maybe the first month. After that you can't hold enough water in it or enough baby. If you put too much water it goes everywhere and it is not that compact. Keep looking there are better product out there!
101251,1,"These diapers worked very well for my daughter, but I wish I would have bought the next size up because she is chubby and they are not that wide if your baby is closer to the maximum weight, but overall they work great."
180098,2,"I wanted this to work and thought it would be good to give it a try before putting down a couple hundred for the electric pumps. So it was with a sad heart that I have to write that this manual pump did not do what it said it would. I am breastfeeding and wanted to make sure that my supply held up so thought that I would begin pumping in between feedings. However, the manual pump did not work very well and after a few times the suction just felt like it disappeared. Pump as I might, I could only get about 1/2 an ounce at each pump and my hands would be sore after 20 minutes. I ended up purchasing an electric pump and right away could tell the difference. As most women who pump know, you still have to massage and ""milk"" your breast with an electric pump but they work so much better than this manual one. I purchased the Medela pump in style and now can get about 2-3 ounces of milk at each pumping, sometimes more. Would definitely not recommend shelling out 30 dollars for this pump."
103682,1,These wipes are individually wrapped so they are convenient to take along and clean breastpump parts and accessories when you can't wash them after each use.
117889,1,"I don't know how people can say that this rack doesn't hold all bottle sizes. It sure does. You can put the wide neck or smaller Dr Browns on this. It will hold the smaller neck bottles up a little higher and the wider bottles down flat onto the bottom. But all bottles work. And, better yet, it has the extra tray like places to to store everything else. It is nice b/c you can put all the extra parts in the tray and even put them on top of each other and they dry perfect. Then the place where you can lay the nipples sideways is great. I use the dr browns bottles and the I put the tubes sticking through the spaces by the nipples. Then there is the small tray that I put my yellow pieces of the medela pump. It is soooooooooo versitile!!! Who would want a rack with just the poles. Then you can only dry bottles and no other parts. DUH!!"
101091,1,I've been using this brand since we took our 1st LO (who is now 16 mo.) out from the hospital since she was born... I'm using the same brand for our 2nd LO a NB. Have always been satisfied... I've tried huggies but I think I just got comfortable with pampers already so decided to stick with it. Plus to start off its the brand used by the hospitals.... I guess coz its more affordable than huggies.
149433,0,We bought this in hopes of helping our children sleep while driving and not waking up in a bad mood or early because their neck was killing them. This is a hard task to tackle as you want to make sure they can breathe well and also be comfortable while still keeping their head into position without using a bungee strap.At first my son didnt want anything to do with it but he is growing on it. He has used it a few times and it could work better but I dont know how. Like I said this is a hard task to tackle. When he falls asleep sometimes it will slide forward. I think you could attach it to a seat belt but my son would flip out in claustrophobic rage if we did that. He likes to control stuff like this on his own. I am glad we have it but I wish there was something that we felt safe with and worked all the time.
38559,1,"My oldest loved to lay on this thing and listen to the water so I could have her with me and take a nice long hot shower as a single mom, it was my single most favorite product. My new baby does not like the sound or feel of shower water and isn't too keen on being naked either so this isn't quite the same but it still functions really well as a safe place to lay her and clean her up and putting her on it at an angle with warm bath water just up over her tummy her seems to get her to push out gas that is bothering her."
130860,0,"I got this item as a gift from my employees at work. My husband chose this for our registry. Anyway, it is really nice and cute, but is really large for a smaller room, uses 4 d batteries almost every other week with use, and now the entire motor unit is broken after only 3 months of use. Fortunatly, the wonderful people at fisher price are replacing the unit at no charge to us!! There is a date code on the unit and I guess that proved that the item did not hold up. I personally would have liked something a little smaller and maybe something that would have a little less battery use. Also, like many reviews I read, this item does swing a little fast for my infant."
6246,2,I bought this video monitor for the night vision. But I can only get a good picture when the light is on. At night half the screen looks like fog. It hurts my eyes to look at the screen and I can't even see my child on the monitor. The monitor works fine for daytime but if you want to see your child in the dark this monitor is a waste of money.
38427,1,"I love spending time in a bath tub and with this I can rest my head or use it to shave my legs giving me something to prop them on. I enjoy taking a bath with my baby and this bathing pillow is absolutely wonderful. I can keep water from entering her delicate little ears, and keep her happy floating with just the right ammount of water surrounding her. If you're having a hard time deciding on a bath mat/accessory for your baby...this is the one. Later you can use it in the pool/beach as a fun toy. They love it. And so do I. I would definitely purchase this again."
9753,1,"We started elimination communication with our daughter when she was five months old so we needed a potty that would give her support since she couldnt sit up on her own. This potty was perfect with the high back . We would place a hand on her tummy so she could Not fall forward but with the high back she was able to lean back and be comfortable. This potty has a non-skid bottom which is perfect for counter tops or wood floors. Some may think it is a little bulky when traveling and we have found that if we go to camp we just take the insert with us and she just uses that. We are very happy with this product our daughter doesn't seem uncomfortable when using, it securely stays put when she is using it, and easy to rinse out reusable insert. We love :-)"
137895,1,The Ladybug is tough. I bought 2 and they survived poor packaging and USPS left them in the rain. It's just the right cute toy accessory for a young child - or an older child at heart.
33926,0,"I like the bag, but you can't zip it with 8 oz. Brown's bottles in it. I need to take 3 bottles and 2 baby foods to daycare, and that will not remotely make it in this bag. However, the bag is narrow too, which is great for carrying the small medela bottles that you pump milk into which have a tendency to leak."
15606,0,"It took three (3) orders before we got one that wasn't broken during shipment. And, it was impossible to communicate the needed repair part to the Customer service rep (they were nice but consistently sent the wrong part - Gee, I wonder if a parts list might help???Also, the newer gates are much lighter the the gate we used to purchase.Good luck..."
8285,1,"I own house rabbits so I found the wire mesh to be more suitable for keeping smaller pets enclosed. What I found with this gate is that a child or dog could easily push this out of a doorway. The locking system is a little tough to get an exact fit in a warped doorway in an older home. I like the sturdiness of the wood and wire. Rabbits chew plastic so the wire makes this ideal for ferrets, rabbits or guinea pigs."
170838,2,"Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet. Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads. I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels. Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry. Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry."

157660,1,"I bought this gate over a year ago to keep the dog and our son out of the basement and from falling down the stairs. This is a very sturdy gate. It is great because you can see who is coming up the stairs but strong enough to hold back a 70 pound jumping golden retriever. As in other comments, the directions are difficult but if you follow everyone's advice, it was easy to install. Our gate also had to be set at an angle due to how our walls are, it was no problem for this gate. Love it! Definitely worth the money."
45565,1,"I received this item for my newborn daughter. At first I loved the idea of having hanging toys, mirror, music and lights all in one piece... however, the hanging animals hang so low that they almost hit her in the face and there is no way to shorten them. She is only 3 months old and seems to like the set, but what about when she is a little older (bigger)? I do love the big mirror though, she can see herself from almost anywhere on the blanket. There is a choice of Mozart or Nursery Rhymes Music but they only play for 1-2 minutes at a time and you need to keep resetting the music. Thankfully it is not too loud, just the right volume for babies and toddlers."
66956,1,"Relatively easy to install. Very sturdy. Once you get used to opening it with one hand, it is a piece of cake."
129405,1,"I noticed my son was starting to show interest in sucking his hands and even in my hands as well. So when i saw this toy at a nearby bookstore i decided to try it out with my 3 month old son. I figured the slim and squishy loops would be easy to grab and comfortable to chew/suck on. When I gave it to him, he just LOVED it! He sucks and chews on the loops all day and he looks really content. And I like the fact that even if he happens to bump his face to the toy, it doesn't hurt him at all. If I had a friend who was looking for a ""baby's first toy"" I would definitely recommend this toy."
107137,1,"So we have a 2 month old baby girl and use the Diaper Champ. No real complaints at all. The smell is negligible. And you'll find yourself dropping other trash beyond diapers into this convenient trash can.Now, once your kid is older and eating solid foods, things might start getting stinky. But I've heard from friends that smell problems are ubiquitous for older kids regardless of the diaper pail. They put poopy diapers in a plastic grocery store bag and immediately take them out of the house. Wet diapers are still fine. These guys have all sorts of diaper pails, so I don't think that any pail is really much better on that front for older kids.A great aspect of the Diaper Champ is the use of regular trash bags. Sure it saves money. But the key is that you don't have to plan ahead to prepare for the onslaught of diapers that your kid will produce. Suppose that it's 3:00 AM and you've run out (or are running out) of Diaper Genie refills. You're not going to be happy. Maybe you run to the 24 hour drug store and pay out the whazoo for a refill. But with the Champ, you don't have to worry about that. And you'll have lots of things to worry about with a newborn (and LOTS of diapers to change), so a sufficient supply of diaper pail refills is one of the last things that you'll want to think about. To avoid inconveniences associated with the prospect of running out of refills, I'd never trade my Diaper Champ for a pail that requires proprietary refills."
149037,2,"I bought a snoogle but when I saw the back n belly I thought wow that looks like a cloud or something.. boy what a disappointment. First off where you rest your head and put your hand under the head part it will GOUGE you in the shoulder, as mentioned in other reviews. 2nd its not long enough, like the snoogle. It barely goes down to your knees and its a battle to keep it there between your knees. The Snoogle wraps up between your legs, which is nice. The snoogle got lumpy after months of use BUT I am going to restuff it. Just go to Walmart or craftstore and buy pillow stuffing and restuff it. You can even hand sew it back together. Only takes an inch or so of open material.AND this is waaay too big. Takes up WAY over half my queen size bed. Poor husband:(I'll be sending this back."
64768,2,"The slowest setting on this swing is still too fast. My son wouldn't sit in it without being scared until he was about 3 months old. About 2 months later he became curious about the fish in the blue water and went to look at them closer and his head went between the two bars. HIS HEAD WAS BASHED BETWEEN THE TWO BARS! BAM BAM BAM!!! He's too young to realize, 'hey, everytime I move my head 5 inches to the right or left, it gets bashed between these two things holding me up so I better not do that.' I don't understand why this thing is on the market. He didn't need to be hospitalized, but that doesn't mean it's safe. I stopped using it, but didn't throw it away. My mom came over to babysit, she didn't know, and the same thing happened again. DO NOT BUY THIS SWING!!! TELL YOUR FRIENDS NOT TO BUY THIS SWING! AWEFUL, AWEFUL, TERRIBLE, SWING!!"
168002,1,"I ordered these diapers for my daughter as a monthly shipment. Recently I was out for a visit & I noticed how my granddaughter could 'sleep' thru a wet diaper. When she awoke, I'd changed her & the diaper was heavy from being wet, but amazingly her bottom wasn't very wet & not irritated a bit!These daipers really pull the urine away from baby's skin & keep her drier longer."
125654,2,"This gate was very difficult to install, and even after it was assembled, it was not sturdy. We had to add some extra screws to attach the two pieces of the gate together and make sure they did not come apart when our one-year-old pushed on them - they are not actually supposed to be physically attached at all, but insecurely secured together with some plastic pieces around the ends (it's hard to explain). The non-wooden attachment parts are fairly flimsy plastic. We have a lot of experience with baby gates (and have been happy with other Kidco gates), but this is by far the worst we have ever seen."
80407,1,"we have the one with brown trim, but i had to write a review here too because we just LOVE this blanket. it's super soft, the perfect size for swaddling, and nice and light AND still warm for baby. we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son, but doesn't cause him to wake up sweaty. it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it's COMPLETELY worth the money! i'd buy another in a second."

81021,0,"The cushion seat is great when it comes to portability; however, it tends to fold once the child is seating on it... Like if it is about to break, but it isn't. I don't know if this is because my 2 year old is too heavy (almost 30 pounds)Or because most toilets are too wide for the cushion seat... I use it everytime we're on the go regardless....And it hasn't broken!"
106586,2,"We had the original version of the Diaper Champ for 4.5 years and 2 kids. It was getting a little smelly so I replaced it with the new and improved version. Yes, the wider opening is easier to use, but it does not contain the smell nearly as well as the old version. I used to put all diapers in it, and change it 2 times a week, for 4.5 years. With this one I can't even put the stinky diapers in it at all, they just have to go right outside. I put one stinky diaper in it, and came back to my son's room 2 hours later (he'd been asleep with the door closed) when I opened the door to his room the smell almost knocked me over. For the people with 3 month olds who rave about this diaper pail. Write again when your baby is eating solid food and let us know how you think this one does."
130122,1,"I am your greatest reviewer - I am what you could call a repeat customer. I had the first generation cradle swing about 4 years ago, before the Aquarium came out with all the bells and whistles. My first son is now 5 years old, and he slept in his swing all night for about 5 months. That's the only way I got any sleep. Now my twin boys are 18 months, and we bought 2 Aquarium cradle swings. It's the same phenomenon. I'm telling you, every good thing people say about these swings is true. THEY ARE LIFESAVERS!! Even when we dared to travel, these swings came with us. We just took off the seats - it's one simple screw and nut - we folded them up and loaded them in the Excursion. It was all we needed to take. TRUST ME IF YOU TRUST NO ONE ELSE. I've had 3 of these swings - first my son in '99, and then the twins. We have just gone to porta cribs for naps and sleeping, so we're done. But God bless the Aquarium cradle swing. There is nothing better. I know - I've lived it."
140536,1,"The motorized swing works great. Various settings for sounds, speed and other things make it hard to find a problem. There fastening system for holding him in is very well designed and the ability to change the direction the swing moves is also a big help. The item came early and was in store-shelf condition."
55723,1,This warmer is great! We were warming bottles with warm water or boiling. We were also making formula individually! This is so much easier. We make our bottles ahead of time (and use within 24 hours) and then pop them in the warmer. The measurement is perfect and the bottle is warm in a few minutes (the time of changing a diaper). I would recommend this to anyone having a baby and in fact have recommended it to two people already!
98496,1,"I take a bubble bath nightly, and I have tried every kind of bubble bath that I can get my hands on. California Baby's Overtired & Cranky bubble bath is hands-down the best product of its kind that I've found!I like California Baby for a number of reasons, including the fact that there is no Sodium Laureth Sulfate or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in the bubble bath, both of which really dry out my skin. It's almost impossible to find even a handful of products that don't use one of those two ingredients, so I was thrilled to discover California Baby! I also love the light, natural smell (you don't feel like you're bathing in an air freshener), the large amount of bubbles (a lot more than you might expect from a soap-free product), and the fact that it's extremely gentle. Plus, each bottle comes with a bubble wand inside, so you can blow bubbles all over your bathroom!I know that I'm carrying on a lot, but I really think that anyone who enjoys a nice bath should try California Baby. If you're like me, you won't want to use anything else."
114722,1,I bought the seat for my sisters little girl-best buy ever she loves it!
28774,1,The product arrived quickly and was carefully packed. It was easy for me to put together with good instructions. The chair and ottoman are well made and a nice addition to my home.
54494,1,"When I chose a mobile for my baby, my biggest concern was a battery-powered one. I wanted to avoid a wind-up one. This one immediately appealed to me due to its design consideration for visual stimulation for a baby.But, I will everyone right now who is considering it - it is LOUD. The motor has a very definite whirr and the beads do clank when they slide now the bars. This is not a problem for my daughter, because she sleeps so much better with white noise. This definitely fills the bill.My daughter does love to just look at the mobile (I barely have to turn it on anymore) and coo at the silly little creatures.To all of those other reviewers who had a problem with assembly and the mobile falling apart, you have to use force to get the toys attached. I had to pass it off to my husband to do, since I was not able to get it successfully attached. And if it continues to fall, then it might be a defective model. Take it back to the store where purchased and return it."
110646,0,"I have not used mine yet because my baby is not ready to meet he world, but I have put it together. It was pretty easy to put together. The mattress is harder than I would prefer but we will see if she likes it."
112918,0,"I bought these after trying Seventh Generation because I hadn't tried any other brand and wanted a change. Of course I read the reviews about them being perforated, I just assumed the person meant that the wipes were folded together to make it easier to pull them out.These are the reasons Tushies wipes are not for me:-No peel-back sticker to remove individual wipes at a time. Once you open it, it's open. I like having the sticker for the package I keep in my diaper bag.-Very wet. When I take out a new package, I squeeze excess liquid out. And there's still enough to last the whole package.-The wipes themselves are thin. Thin wipes plus the wetness make them very flimsy. I end up using at least 1/5 of the package to clean a 'dirty' diaper."
113254,1,"We bought this for my sons two year birthday. It is a sturdy and good looking. The paint finish chip fairly easily, but because it is black it is very easy to touch up. I just use a black Sharpie, make a dot on the chip and wipe the over the mark, and you would not know it was there in the first place. If it was not for that I would have given 5 stars."
131125,2,I was very disapointed. I washed before using it and that was it. Could not use anymore. I used baby detergent and tunble dry in a low setting. Don't buy it. it's a waste of money
1116,0,"I am a new mommy, but I have learned really fast what diapers work and which ones don't. I love Pampers! The Baby Dry have been great, except that they are lacking the stripe that turns blue when baby is wet. The line is super helpful; it made us realize (after using non-line diapers) that our son was wet ALL THE TIME, which was causing a lot of his fussiness. Otherwise, they are great! No leaks!"
78672,1,"The traveling toddler is a clever T shaped strap that connects the latch hooks on your car seat around a carry on wheeled case. For our test we used a Brittax marathon car seat on the airplane itself and had connecting flights.Hooking and un-hooking for security screens and placing the car seat on the plane was fine. We didn't use our infant in the seat connected to the carry-on bag, however the carry-on was stable with the car seat attached moving and at rest. Moving the car seat between connecting flights was so much easier than using the car seat 'bags'.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again, however depending on the plane age and seat configuration getting the stroller down a long aisle was mixed. Sometimes exit rows and first class seats would require me to adjust the angle of the car seat to go under or above the arm rests, in rare cases I gave up and just lifted the carry on over one very narrow first class row. We had similar issues with the sit-n-stroller. The newer seat layouts seem to trade seat width against aisle width"
3100,2,Our daughter was born 22 Inches long and every time she kicked her feet the bottom would come on done. I guess if your baby is not a kicker it will work for you. We have the First Steps swaddel blanket which is much better then this one.
120406,0,"We bought this monitor because we were very worried about SIDS. Once we started using it, we slept better and felt our baby was much more secure. It worked great at first, and only alarmed when we picked up our baby for a diaper change or feeding and forgot to switch it off (we soon learned to turn it off before picking him up). However, once we started turning it off before picking him up, we never really thought to test it out again. After a few months, I forgot to turn it off one day when picking him up and it never alarmed- it continued working as if the baby was still in the crib breathing/moving!! My husband and I realized it could have been MONTHS since it last worked properly and we didn't even know it. We returned it to Babies R Us and received a full refund on the defective product. I don't necessarily advise against this monitor, but I would advise anyone using it to test it DAILY to prevent a false sense of security (and keep that receipt, just in case). It's a great invention, but only great if it is truly working."
20480,2,"There wasn't a ruffled cover, or pad cover! I had this sent as a gift!"
183864,1,"Don't use the spoons or forks that came with this set. However, the cups, lips and containers are great. As another reviewer said: it is pint-sized tupperware. Cleans easy but doesn't wear easy. We use these all day long day after day and the whole thing can fit in my diaper bag on a light day to go to Grandma's."
180480,1,My daughter in-law really likes it. It has lots of compartments. I think she would like it more if it were a little bigger. It's great for the dad's. Camo is always cool!!
80876,0,It's adorable & works well but pieces will break off from handle area. Could be dangerous once kids got older & started crawling...
18667,1,"I have 6 grandkids & each one has received the bunnykins bowl & cup when they were born.They are still used by my 5, 6, & 7 yr olds. The shape of the inside of bowl is shaped to make the food easier to ""scoop"" onto the spoonPlease don't be afraid to use everyday, trust me, they are very sturdy.When my oldest was born (39 years old now) he received s bowl & I gave it back to him when he had his first born.She loves it!"
89905,1,"My husband and I always thought that before we had children we wouldn't spend the money on expensive diapers. What's the use, we'll be changing our baby so much anyways. Well now that we've had our daughter and she is 5 months old the only diaper brand we'll use is Pampers! Believe me we've tried them all. It is so worth having a diaper that doesn't leak and is comfortable on your baby! I'm so glad we're not having to waste time cleaning out blowouts! Well worth the money and we've received some coupons which we loved in some of the boxes! We are going to try the cruisers out next. Pampers all the way!"
69777,2,"I like the reclining aspect of the chair but the seat pad is too loose and hard to clean. I was mislead by the description because I was led to believe that the pad was wipable. You won't get the pasta sause off the pad until you wash it in the washing machine. The seat pad was cloth/fabric not vinyl so every week I have to wash it.""Dishwasher safe parent assist tray, wipeable, removable vinyl seat pad, wipeable plastic tray, footrest and frame"""
173704,2,"Got this as a gift from grandparents before our son was born. He hates it and screams every time we put him in it. Thankfully, he's a very easy baby and usually doesn't cry or get upset unless he's hungry or needs a diaper change. This swing and the car seat are one of the things he dislikes. Complete waste of money."
71204,1,"Great value. Our 2-month-old loves looking at the toy bar, and he loves being able to rock himself in the rocker. We love that it is easily portable and multi-functional."
110228,0,"The chair itself is comfortable and looks great.Here's the problem . . .We ordered the chair on 9/21, got it 9/29 (great!)Some nimrod at FedEx punched a giant hole in the box, which damaged the chair base, and the driver decided it was ok to leave like that (not great; boo FedEx, not Shermag or Amazon's fault).Contact Shermag a day later, give them the SN #, and they say they will send out a replacement base (great - yeah Shermag!)We decide to hold off on assembling until new base arrives.Call about three weeks later to inquire about replacement base? Shermag never sent it out (WTH Shermag?)Baby is due 11/10, so we decide to go ahead and assemble it, and replace the base when we get it.Chair is missing to 100mm bolts that hold the arms to the chair back. In other words, you can't use the chair without them as they tie the arms/base to the chair back. (WTH x2 Shermag!!??)Moral of the story? We have a partially assembled chair with a damaged base and missing bolts, the baby is due any day now, and I'm off to the hardware store to play ""guess what the pitch/thread count is on this metric bolt"" because Shermag can't be bothered to do good QC or at least put the full hardware specs in the instruction manual."
82754,0,I like this sound machine for travel and in the car but I don't think it is loud enough. I am using the Happiest Baby on the Block soothing methods and use it when trying to put the baby to sleep on the go but I can barely hear it when outside or in the car even on it's loudest setting. I took the sound machine out of the sheep and you can hear it a lot better but it makes the sheep a waste.
57185,2,"The product is a great idea. It went back the day after I received it though. No matter what I tried, the Kidco Bath Safety Rail would NOT securely attach to the side of the tub. The suction would not stick and it was very wobbly. Again, it's a great idea, but I think if it were made a little less cheaply it would work fine."
79985,2,"We have had three of these. Two of them have had their flip lids snapped and cracked when my son or daughter dropped them--and kids drop things! The lid is just a very brittle plastic and with a hinge that makes it very vulnerable in a fall. I've temporarily fixed them with superglue but it eventually cracks again. While thermos makes great adult products, a heavy stainless steel can is a lot for a kid. So otherwise its a beautiful mug, but gets very expensive as it breaks and drops. Thermos need to modify this and avoid a design with this brittle flip lid."
167931,1,I am between these Huggies pull-ups and Pampers Easy-Ups. There are some pros and cons about both. I am potty training my daughter and the pull-ups with the cool alert seem to help better but the sides come off very easily and they stick to my daughter's skin. It is very difficult for my 2yr old to pull this ones down and up. But the cool alert is great.
104278,0,"Installing this to our stair balusters was a two person job, one on each side of the balusters. It serves its purpose of both keeping the dog from going between the balusters and preventing the baby from sticking his arms between them and also from throwing toys down the stairs. It's not pretty and it would be nice if there was a better way to deal with the two ends."
32407,1,"I absolutely love this gate. We were going to get two, but only got one to make sure we'd like it. We didn't want to drill any holes and our gate sits at the bottom of the stairs just like in the pictures, only on the floor not the first step. It's great. All four points where the gate touches the wall are different depth and I also used the extension kit and it works perfectly. It is very stable and my little boy can't open it or pull it down. I'm about to order another one for the top of the stairs."
165471,1,"I found that these baby dry diapers hold up well during the night for my son. They are not as soft as pampers cruiers, but work great. I found amazon to be the best price around, (are they were shipped right to our door!)"
7102,1,"We've used Pampers Cruisers (and Swaddlers before that) for years now with no complaints. When we used other brands, diaper rashes seemed to be regular occurrences and those other brands often had an unpleasant odor to them, right out of the package. Not so with Pampers Cruisers.The only time we've ever had a leak is when I've delayed buying the next size up, when it's really past time to do so. I've found it also helps to give the diaper a little ""hoist"" up at the back waist area, after the child is standing up with a fresh diaper, before she's on the go again. It seems to help with a better fit and no leaks."
11611,0,"Its good, but lately it takes a long time to warm up, and then the formular its too hot... I dont even use it anymore."
121406,2,"I purchased 2 of these baby walkers and was very disappointed at the quality of the product. once i got the package and i wanted to return it but the shipping was almost as much as the walker. it came together pretty easy, but the high was not adjustable. the back wheels was fixed and can't turn. only the front wheels trun. its too bid and took too much room."
88417,2,Spend the money and get the Baby Bjorn back pack!!! I tried and tried to make this back pack work and it was a hassle. There are too many straps and I couldn't get my son out of it without someones help. If you are trying to save the money which I did...DONT. Spend the extra money and get the baby bjorn it is the most comfortable back pack carrier for you as well as your baby. My son loves it. He even falls asleep in it facing forward. I use it everywhere.
39022,1,These covers work pretty well. I would recommend changing the diaper at least every three hours or less to insure no leaks. I love how the snaps help to make the cover adjustable and comfortable for my lil' one.
41970,1,"Used at my daughters house. Liked it so much, bought it for a friend's new baby. She loves it, too. Great for keeping baby supply clutter under control."
171254,1,"I would HIGHLY recommend this tub. It is everything you need, simplicity and goo ddesign. It is not the most expensive, which only makes it better. Don't be fooled into thinking that you need to spend more money to get a better tub, this one is perfect. My friends of infants also agree!The only downfall is that it doesn't fit into my huge old fashioned porcelain sink. That's ok though, I just put it on the countertop and use the sprayer from the kitchen sink."
35857,1,"We've tried several AIO diapers and found these to be the best so far, and the least expensive, compared to pro-wraps and other high end AIO diapers. The attached insert is very long (you double it over when using it) so it dries quickly in the dryer, which saves a lot of time and money. The elastic is really strong and so is the velcro. Our son can take off his disposables (we use 7th Gen. diapers, at night and when traveling) but can't undo these. The store even made a personal call to me before shipping to pick out colors. We weren't sure we were up for all the washing, etc. for cloth, but have found that by just leaving the washer half full all day, we just drop each used diaper in and do the load at the end of the day, no fuss, no muss. We have an 11 month old, though, so I have no idea if these rather large diapers could comfortably be folded to fit a newborn - I'm a bit skeptical on that one.Also a great tip, for those who prefer to avoid rinsing poopy diapers, try: Biosoft Flushable Diaper Liners - we love them. You can flush them, or we just put them in the diaper pail since we also use disposables some of the time and want to go easy on our septic tank."
144222,1,"We purchased this spout guard specifically to prevent injury during exhuberant play in the bath tub. Our son likes to splash a lot and will stand up very quickly if he gets water in his eyes. This product has plenty of cushion to prevent him from hurting his head. The only downside is that it doesn't allow us to switch from tub spout to shower because the pull-up knob is covered by the frog's head. Otherwise, it's perfect for keeping our son from hurting his head."
79170,1,"For the first couple of weeks our little one was home we used the regular flow nipples that came with the Similac 2 oz. Ready to Feed bottles. But by the third week he was eating so fast that he was wearing much of the formula on his onesie and choking on it from flowing into his mouth too fast. I went online and found these nipples, hoping to slow the speed of his feeding down a little. Not only were they inexpensive (in the stores you get two nipples for the same price of these six), but they work perfectly. Although it does make our little one have to ""work for it"" more than the regular flow nipples, he no longer chokes on too much formula in his mouth and it doesn't spill as much onto his onesie. The nipples fit both the regular mouth size baby bottles (as opposed to the wide mouth) and the ready to feed bottles. I can't say how much this has helped our little one!"
36279,0,I love the product but has been delivered 2 out of 3 times with broken glass. The manufacturer needs to properly pack and protect the scroll from hitting & cracking the glass.
60260,0,"This is in my baby shower list due to the high rating of this product. I agree with most of the reviewers that this is a good product BUT not for newborn baby. Since the size is pretty large, for a newborn, especially in the winter, if you just put little water and with the large surface area, water cold up pretty quickly! So, we ended up bought a smaller size one for our newborn and only use this product after my kid reaches around 6 months."
86832,0,"i just loved the 4oz bottles so much that i bought the 8oz so i wouldn't have to fill two 4 oz bottles for the 'bigger' feedings. well, i am not as happy with the 8oz bottles. my baby doesn't like to grab them and the liners are more likely to 'pop'/burst when you push the air out of them ... i RARELY have a problem with the 4 oz. i hate cleaning the dr browns and the dishwasher doesn't seem to get the oily formula residue off of them... but i will continue to use dr browns large bottle and the 4oz drop ins. just my two cents."
39904,1,"I bought this to replace an older model Homedics sound machine which I lost the AC adapter for. This one is much better! The speaker is much clearer and the buttons are better (the old one had a volume dial instead of separate up and down volume buttons, and when you'd move the dial one millimeter it would shoot up in volume and be too loud). I like its size and weight - it'll stay on my slanted art desk no problem. It's hefty enough that if you bump it it won't fall to the floor, and it's small enough that it doesn't take up too much space. It has the options of leaving it on all night or using a 60-minute timer that will shut off after you're asleep. I think it goes up to a very loud sound level - noise machines are supposed to be white noise/background noise so aren't expected to be as loud as a stereo or TV. I like that you can add 2 of the sounds together. I would recommend ocean and gull as the most soothing. This is listed as a baby product but is really for any age!"
112938,1,"I absolutely love this dresser. Its exquisite and sleek and the color is beautiful. The directions on how to put it together were very descriptive, it took my husband 2 hours tops to put it together and i was surprised at how hefty it turned out to be. Its perfect :)"
174902,0,"I bought this tub with the intention of using it as a travel tub for trips to visit family. The concept is great because it doesn't take up much space when there's so much other baby gear to cart around. But make sure to have a mechanical air inflator to blow this thing up! Otherwise it'll probably take forever (I has to try using my own lungs, thankfully).This cute tub should not be used for smaller babies or newborns though. It's very hard to hold a baby securely yourself while simultaneously bathing him. Also, the temperature feature which lights up ""HOT"" when the water filling it is too warm, is off. It reads 'hot' when the water isn't very hot at all, so don't be alarmed. It also has a suction cup on the bottom of either end to grip the surface you put it on, but I think this tub should stay put once filled with water. Besides, these suction cups cause the tub to stay too stuck when you're trying to move the tub over a little or clean it out in the end.I also came to discover this tub to have a cute feature of quacking when you grip the beak...entertaining for the kids I suppose, though it startled me the first time!Overall it's alright, provided your child isn't a newborn and as long as you don't head the temperature sensor."
459,0,"I figured that these would be good diapers for day and night for our 12mo, but nope. Almost every other day we find her onesie or sleeper with a big pee spot on it. For daytime use, these diapers are great, just don't expect them to work for 12 hours."
59018,1,"I agree that the lack of an on/off switch is design flaw; however, the problem is simply remedied by setting the kitchen timer. Through a little trial and error, I was able to determine the correct setting for bottles. I like that I can use the regular and disposable bottles in the warmer. On the rare occassions that the bottle has overheated (i.e. I forgot to set the timer), I simply run the bottle under cold water for a few seconds."
162353,0,"My baby had reflux from the day she was born and seemed we were always having to give her medicine. We used the dropper the most-in fact the markings are starting to rub off. I liked the markings on the dropper. The ones we got free from the pharmacie were marked for smaller dosages. I like the nail clipper. i was afraid to use the aspirator -it looked too sharp to me. The medicine spoon is not usefull and the thermometer doesn't beep. The little case is nice, but overall, I agree buy the items separately."
55199,0,"I have always used the unscented wipes from pampers and decided to try the scented ones for a change. I use a wipes warmer which works very well with all kinds of wipes except this one. The scented ones seem to dry up very very quickly. I, almost always, had to discard the top wipe and use the next one so it would be moist. Would not recommend it if you are planning to use with a wipes warmer."
115193,0,I bought this gate for my lab puppy. It works but I would not recommend it for upstairs use with babies.It works well and does the job for my puppy but I don't think it with work with babies without being bolted into the walls.My older dog is able to push it and it slides a little out of place without falling but it won't be safe for children. If you are looking at this one for kids make sure it is bolted into the walls and you will love it.
14503,0,"I first used these bottles when my son was born two years ago. Like some of the other reviewers, I found that these bottles leaked. I had to tighten/untighten them all the time and although not all the seals leaked, many of them did. Now, with the BPA issue, I'm not using them at all with my new baby. I've purchased a different brand that doesn't leak, doesn't have BPA, and is also less expensive."
44246,1,This diaper bag is awesome. I love that it attaches to the stroller with two velcro straps. Wipes clean easily and has a great amount of storage.
144316,1,"So far I love this car seat and so does my son. He is still sitting facing backwards waiting to turn one. He is a large boy, and I needed to upgrade him from his infant seat at a little over six months of age. He was much happier in his new car seat than his little infant seat. He is currently about 10 months old, is 31 inches tall and weighs about 23.5 lbs. While he is still content to look backwards, I'm sure he will be happier to face forward. The belts are easy to use and it fits just fine in my vehicle, which is an SUV. I have not had any problems with the diaper area being too tight as mentioned in several other reviews of the same product without the Nebraska logo. All in all a great seat!"
133828,0,"I just got this in the mail today and put it up to replace my other diaper stacker which was tearing up our changing table (it was a metal hanger type, not a tie like this one). First impressions... it's vibrant; Very brilliant colors. It is also very soft! I wasn't really expecting it to be this soft seeing as how all the other diaper stackers I've went through are unflattering material for the most part. I hung it up in the nursery and had a little over half a box of economy size diapers and it fit with no problems and I'm actually betting had I had the other half... it would have fit too! My little one is in size 3s and with all those diapers in there... you still couldn't see the diapers! The green strips in the middle still touched. I'm very impressed! Especially considering the awesome deal I got on it! =)***UPDATE*** The top of the diaper stacker has started to bend at the tie. It bends in a ""V"" shape toward the front of the stacker due to the green part being cardboard underneath and all the pressure being placed there. The design is a bit flawed; had they added a tie to each end instead of in the middle, this would not be an issue. It still holds all the diapers well though and it's still very attractive and soft."
133882,1,"We like this potty so far. We've just started offering &quot;potty time&quot; to our 19-month old son. We first purchased a standalone potty. Our son treats it like a toy, though, and does not want to sit on it long enough for any progress. We thought using an attachment for the real toilet might be more clear to him. It worked - we had a successful experience the first time he tried it! He definitely understands what it is for. It is also more portable for visiting grandparents, etc., than a standalone. We did not have any problems using it with a boy as suggested by another reviewer. I'm buying a second one for upstairs."
105025,0,"I liked the hearth kushion because it prevents your baby/child from getting hurt. However, my 1 year-old grandson wants to pull on it and it comes off too easily. If they would make it to stick better that would be great!"
109530,1,"I bought these for my daughter when she was teething and they worked perfect. We put fresh frozen strawberries or frozen bananas in it and it soothed her almost instantly! I think they love the taste as well as the cold. Was a little difficult to get the strawberry seeds out of the meshwork at times, but a good soak does the trick. I've ordered these for a few baby shower presents and have heard great reviews from other moms as well."
104946,1,My experience with the peppermint variety of Dr. Bronner's soap has been excellent. I have very sensitive skin and usually the soap i use is either chemically too harsh or loaded with chemical fragrances that can cause me allergy troubles. I first bought this soap on a lark as I've always liked the smell of peppermint and recently I've moved back to using a bath brush for exfoliation. The difference this soap and a brush have made are impressive as my skin has cleared up significantly. The peppermint smell is also wonderful and has actually garnered compliments... which has only been slightly awkward.Unlike other the miraculous claims other beauty products make I actually can attest that I feel more energetic after my morning ablutions (Note: The wrapper claims this is due to the peppermint oil being a mild stimulant.) I enthusiastically recommend this product without reservation to anyone who is looking for a natural soap that serves its function well.
103894,1,"This product really helped out with engorgement- espically because I was unable to breast feed right away due to our child having to go back to the hospital at 3 days old for a week- right when my milk came in. The horns themselves are not larger- but the ""tube"" where your nipples go into is larger. I would recommend this for larger breasted women/larger nipples."
111583,1,"This pump works very well for a nursing mom who might need to do some pumping from time to time. It is relatively small (as compared to an electric pump), quiet, simple, and easy to use once the milk supply is well established. I definitely recommend it for an occasional user.I would not recommend it for multiple uses a day or for use when struggling with supply for the following reasons:* All parts of the pump have to be washed between uses and needs to dry thoroughly. This is fine when it can be dried overnight, but not so fine when you need to use it again soon.* This is effective, but still slow. With an electric double pump, I can pump completely in about 10 minutes. With this single manual pump, it takes about 30 minutes to get about 50%-75% the amount of milk.* Until long after my milk supply was well established, I had a hard time achieving let-down with this pump, therefore I have to think that this is not the best device for helping establish supply.Now that I am back at work I now use a double electric pump during the day and just store the electric one at the office. I keep this manual pump at home for back up."
121672,1,The use of this eases and provided comfort for mom and baby while nursing or bottle fed. Also is great support for baby on a flat surface (floor or where he can't roll off).
104397,1,"I did some research before purchasing these gates. I'm using them to keep our dog out of an area of the house. It allows her to see through, which is nice. Tall enough so that if she gets on her hind legs, she won't jump over. Installation was easy enough to do alone without damaging my walls. I like the fact that an extension is included as well. The look is clean and neat and the gate is very easy to use. Well worth the money."
30668,1,"After reading a few of the reviews on this site; we wanted to make sure there was not any confusion with your imonitor? baby monitor. As the instruction manual states; please remember to open your parent units (behind the belt clip) and plug in the battery pack before usage. The units are shipped without the battery attached; to prolong your battery usage. Thank you. Here at Graco, we appreciate your loyal support as a customer. Please check out wwww.gracobaby.com for more information.(By the way- in order to post this comment, we had to select a rating. We put 5 stars; given the product performance. This is not intended to sku any reviews.)"
27683,0,"I took this stoller out of the box, put the wheels on and stood it up (very easy to assemble). It just looked cheap. There are no extra pockets for the kids or parents. My 2 1/2 year old daughters head looked like it was hitting the ""sun canopy"". The sun canopy is a waste of fabric, there is no way that it will cover the sun from the kids eyes, it tilts up!! I put this right back into the box and sent it back right away. I am now getting a BOB instead. You definately get what you pay for."
135495,2,"From the divergent reviews (static vs. no static) it would appear that Graco has quality control problems. The question is whether you want to roll the dice and hope for a good one. I would love to see statistics on what percent have issues. For what it's worth, the static on even the lowest setting is louder than our alarm clock and it gets louder if I turn up the volume. We've found that the best way to hear the baby is to turn off the monitor so we can hear the baby crying through the walls and down the hall. I'm trying to return it, but foolishly recycled the packaging it came in. We do have the usual other devises in the house (cordless phone, wireless router, fisher-price baby monitor) that have no static problems whatsoever. Turning them off has no impact on the static, which leads me to believe it's a quality control issue with the Graco monitor)."
170590,1,"My daughter's only 4 months old, but already she loves this walker! We prop her up with some rolled up receiving blankets (since she can't sit on her own yet) and she goes to town stepping on the buttons on the bar that make noises and tapping the steering wheel for songs and horn! And it's so very cute!! Everyone oohs and awws over it when they come over. I'm very pleased with this product."
167198,1,"I never imagined my 2 year old son would need his car seat for the intended purpose. Last week my husband and son were driving together when someone crashed into them head-on going 55 miles an hour. My son wasn't hurt at all!! He only had 2 little marks on his neck from the straps on the car seat. My husband ended up breaking his hand. They say after a child safety seat is involved in an accident you should throw it away and buy another one. I am buying the exact one. Needless to say, I am very satisfied with this seat and I give it 5 out of 5 stars!!!!"
27682,1,My 3 and 17 month old love this stroller. They like being side-by-side and both of my children are 95% in height and they fit perfect in it. I really like it a lot. It turns and moves very easily opposed to my other double stroller which wasn't side-by-side. I'm very happy with this product.
118711,1,"I recently purchased 2 of these seats for my children ages 6 and 4 for a second vehicle. The seats are very well made, with quality materials. We took the seats on the their first plane trip, and they were very easy to fold. I also purchased the carrying case. This made it very easy for travel. I really like the folding feature, and my kids like armrests and cup holders. I would definetly purchase again."
70690,1,"This is a must have item for twins. We bought the pink one for our daughter and the blue one for our son. Now we can feed both at the same time, you just put both babies in their rockers and one person feeds both. Again, a must have item, we loved these!"
5508,0,"Not a fan. [...]. I've already lost money as it is. Too small - but if you're looking for something to put in your car that might collapse when using. Or you only have a few small items to throw out and don't mind having to empty this each time you use it, then you may like it more than I do."
75969,1,"I always hated how my nipples reared themselves in everything I wear. Thanks to these, I now feel like a ""real man"". Thanks nipple covers!"
183060,0,I like this cover because you can attach various toys to it and use it for tummy time or for proping up a sitting baby but the cover is way too big and does not fit properly over a boppy pillow. I am hoping this cover will shrink in the wash and fit more snuggly.
138019,1,"my neighbor had this and I really liked so got for my son as well and now he will not go to bed without it on. He LOVES this thing and really nice with the different colors. This is one of those ""must-haves"" for your little one!"
34139,1,"We just used this travel bag for the first time last weekend and it worked wonderfully! Prior to this trip we have taken the Britax carseat on board for our son, who is 2, and used the gogo Kidz travelmate to wheel it thru the airport. However, our son is 38"" long and his feet rest on the seat in front of him, so we decided to try him in his own seat with a CARES restraint, which worked out much better!! However, that ment checking his carseat, and we wanted to make sure it didn't get damaged, so we purchased this bag. The backpack feature made the normally cumbersome carseat VERY easy to manage, and the carseat arrived perfectly both times. The material appears to be very durable, but I can't really speak to that because we have had the bag for such a short amount of time. I would highly recommend purchasing this product if you are going to be traveling with the carseat as a checked item!"
30581,1,For a newborn is a great bath center. The hammock it has works perfectly until the baby is 3 month old. My baby is 10 month old and we still use it (without the hammock) and she loves it
16765,2,"This seemed to be a great bed rail for my son who is 2. I bought it so he could not fall of the bed and yes its long enough but not long enough to protect him from falling. Prior to buying this one I had bought the normal regular hide away bed rail and its just got bent. The quality of the metal is not good. when installing them the metals got bent and the pins that make the bed rail come down don't work to great. It does protect the baby from not falling, but the quality of the metal is not that great."
136182,0,"I loved this saucer so much. It was the most expensive one and it had the most things to play with. We put it togther and had such a hard time pulling our 5 month old out of it. So we had it for 3 weeks and the book part started only making the chime noise non-stop. So we had to turn it off. We tried everything. We called Babies R Us and were able to return it and get another one. We were so excited, our daugther loved it. Long story short, it took one week this time and the same problem happened again. We are so sad, but don't feel like returning it for a second time. We shouldn't have to keep doing this. :( Hope others don't have this problem. It would be a great toy if it worked."
42640,0,"I purchased this wrap and have liked using it for the most part. It's relatively easy to use, although there are copious amounts of fabric. I like it's packability and universal usability (my husband is much larger than I am and can also use it). That makes it more portable than the also universal baby bjorn. It is comfortable during long term use. It did seem a bit warm for the summer months, even for indoor use. I also wonder if I should have gotten the sleepy wrap instead. It is the same price, but people who are familiar with both wraps seem to prefer the sleepy wrap. I think the sleepy wrap is a little more elastic which seems like a good thing. When I use the moby wrap there's extra loose fabric here and there which is kinda annoying."
71127,1,"I was not sure which item to order between the fisher price rocker or the swing, then when i saw the rocker could still be used up to about 5 years old that totally sold it for me. I practically use this everyday since she came home from the hospital, because her crib is so far and I am always really busy in the house I can keep an I on her whenever."
71318,1,"My daughter's daycare has this rocker and she absolutely adores it. She loved it so much that I bought one for at home too. She loves the vibration of Fisher- Price items better than the other companies. She's the kind of baby that likes as much motion as possible, so being able to turn on the vibration setting and rock her at the same time is great! I also love that when she's older, it will still serve a purpose instead of being outgrown when she's around 6 months old. She absolutely adores the rainforest bouncy seat. Fisher- Price has really hit the nail on the head with this one."
165228,1,"It's okay. It's the convenience of having the diapers delivered to home, and at a reasonable price. The diapers are okay, though a tad smaller than other equivalent size 3 diapers. Otherwise, am happy with the diapers."
37771,1,"I LOVE Avent bottles...especially how you can transform them into sippy cups! The handles work great, however I do have one warning. You cannot choose the colors when ordering the handles. The picture makes it look like you will get 2 different colors in a 2 pack. I have Boy/Girl twins and got ALL pink handles when I ordered 2 sets."
124959,2,My baby is 4 months old but the size of a one year old. He drowns in this thing! he flops all over inside of it and its not very springy at all! going to find a replacement!
167130,1,"It's great. It washes well, is very comfy for my little guy, just perfect!! A little on the pricey side, but we'll be using it for years, so it's well worth it."
147385,2,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT: stopped working right after the 90 day warranty AND the manufacturer charges a $60 ""examination"" fee before they will tell you if they can repair it for an additional cost."
169236,1,"This is the ebulk package that has the tealish colored packages as shown in the cardboard box. I like how the diapers are in multiple, smaller packages, so that we can take one to daycare and keep the others at home. These have been the best diapers for our baby. The Huggies leaked when she was tiny because she is very long and lean. The Pampers just seem to fit her little bum better. The weight sizing on the diapers seems to be pretty accurate because we have followed the weight guidelines from day one and haven't had any problems. At just under 18 pounds we are finally moving on to size 3 - not because we have had problems with the size 2, but because I want to move up before we do start leaking halfway through the next bulk package. Amazon is a great way to buy diapers with the Subscribe and Save setup. Definitely recommend."
31314,1,I love this product as this is a nice way to organize the bottles and nipples and other parts of the feeding system.
59311,0,The quality of the netting is great but it's a little difficult to cut down to size if you don't have the right length.
34268,1,"This is a sturdy bag that offers good protection for gate checking your car seat. It is reasonably comfortable to carry on your back.Be careful about fit - We have a Britax Advocate 70 CS. Admittedly it's a huge car seat with side padding that makes the car seat very wide. We really struggled to get the car seat into this bag. One of us had to press the sides together while the other one zipped. One person alone definitely would not be able to get this car seat into this bag.UPDATE: We got a second car seat, a Britax Boulevard 70. It is also a large seat but fits perfectly in this bag and travel has been much easier."
102935,2,"With 3 girls, 2 in diapers, this pail is full all the time. It doesn't keep out odors because it stunk up the whole house and isn't sturdy either. One time it tipped over....nuff said!"
130273,1,"I bought this for my grandson who is 7 weeks now and I use it as his sleeping quarters,it lays almost flat.It plays music and the fish spin around,I love it!Very sturdy,have 4 dogs so no need to worry about tipping over.Everyone should have one........."
170605,0,"Love this little car and so do the kids I have 5 month old triplets so it's greatly needed for variety. However, the walker does not come with a horn. Combi has not changed their marketing, information/instruction manual or box pictures to represent this change, and when I called they said ""No, sorry you got two mirrors we no longer have horns they are for the older models"". The walker is still great, but definitely poor customer service and representation of a product. Also my child's hand/wrist did get stuck between the mirror and windshield, so that needs to be removed until they are older."
143230,1,They work just fine; no leaks!Would recommend to anyone wanting to carry the bottles without worrying about leakage.Thanks!
101455,0,"For my first daughter I received a CR Gibson baby book. It had a lot of information to fill in as your child grew. This new book is very pretty, but I was disappointed that it left out some important information that I or my child would want to look back on. The book doesn't have a growth chart, medical records, baby tooth chart or a page that lets your child know what was going on in ""baby's world"" when they were little. I hope they come out with a new and improved book, if they do I'll buy it! Also, books and other matching keepsakes by this company are hard to find and when you find them they usually not in stock.I spoke with person at Publications International back in December, the book is supposed to released to retailers again sometime in March 2005"
124096,2,"I was so excited to use this pop-up for my baby girl. Baby was happy to go in it, both at home and at the beach. It is light, easy to transport, easy to pop open and take down, and I love the SPF factor.... but that's where the positives end. This is very flimsy, cheaply made product that broke after the first use (and no, we didn't use a sledgehammer on it!) It is WAY overpriced for what it is. I would not reccomend this product to anyone who likes to spend their money on quality items. On the other hand, if you actually want to make a one-time-use, disposable purchase, then I say go for it!"
67779,2,"Ok, when I bought i thought it was the best thing I've ever bought in my whole life, baby loved the mattress, I loved the mattress (firm but comfortable) and he slept like never before (colicky baby)I loved being able to look at my baby and see him breath. I loved the fact that is was small and portable.BUT my baby outgrew it by the time he was 1 month and a half...and only 20 1/2 inches!!!as soon as he started to move around his bassinet, he got his head stuck in one of the sides of the co-sleeper perpendicular to his body ( i though he had broken his neck!!)I exchanged it for the Original version of this co-sleeper and I love it again..it is not portable as the mini, does not have wheels, it is not as eady to assemble, and definitely not light, but my baby still loves it, the mattress is still awesome and my baby sleeps through the night and he is only 3 months..."
21015,1,"I have three children. My youngest is 3 months old. I am so excited to do this again for my husband. I did it for Father's Day the year each of my other two children were born and they are proudly displayed on our fireplace mantel. I have a picture of my husband and my son together with my first one, a picture of my daughter and me together for my second, and as my last child is a boy, I imagine I'll try to snag another picture of him with the baby. It was very easy to use, not messy, and forgiving of a squirming youngster. It dried within 24 hours and has preserved perfectly with no cracking or coloring for five years (so far)."
33756,1,"Beautiful table and chairs, I just wish the set came with 4 chairs and not just 2. I'm going to buy extra 2 chairs..."
9809,2,"We started with this potty earlier than the recommended 24 months and our daughter was too short for the splash guard and it would poke her in the bum whenever she tried to sit down. She is now almost 24 months (as recommended by the manufacturer) and it's still a pain. In addition, the seat tips easily when she's trying to lower herself on and slides around all over the tile (bathroom) floor when she's getting on and off. A waste of plastic for our shortish, chubby-thighed girl."
78266,2,"We had to throw this booster seat away, it scratched our wooden chairs. It was also very difficult to clean."
16023,1,Unlike the other review that suggested getting 2x the size of your window -- I would get the perfect fit. You want to see these cute sea animals they shouldn't be all gathered together so you can't see them. The valance in the picture looks wrinkled and the actual valance is so much CUTER in person. I have one very small window (only about 24 inches long). We cut one of the valances in half. With the two extra panels on the valance we made two pillows. I am not a crafty person and it was so EASY. The valance is lined so all we did was put in stuffing and sew up the sides. I also think you could make wall hangings maybe with ribbon as well.
42136,1,It is totally comfortable and roomy. One of my favorite features is the velcro on the sides of the carseat and the straps....it holds the straps to the side while you get the kid settled in. I would definitely buy one again. Only negative is that it has no cup holder. Luckily there is room in the carseat next to my son for his cup.
45241,1,"My son is now close to 6 months old. I started using this mat when he was 1 month old. Of course at that age he pretty much just laid there. As the weeks went by, he started talking to the animals and to himself in the mirror, then he started rolling over, then he started being able to pull down on the elephant, make the music play, etc., etc. It is wonderful to see his development through this toy. Another plus...it takes 2 seconds to pack up in its bag so we can take it with to his grandparents' house!"
67066,2,"I found this carrier to be horribly uncomfortable for carrying my 15 pounder. The shoulder strap cut into my neck, and the waist strap was thin and offered no support at all. I returned it after trying to wear it for about 15 minutes. It's too bad because I really wanted this to work for us!"
174791,1,This item came on time and fits just right. I wish the straps to anchor the pad were a little longer. But overall very good.
113138,2,I would consider my 36 B's to be small to medium sized... so to find that a medium sized breastshield was too small came as a surprise...
110264,1,"The description and picture are very accurate. Purchased this for nursery and couldn't be more pleased. There were not any broken or missing pieces, all pieces were wrapped individually. I am 5'8"" my husband is 5'10"" and we both sit comfortably in chair. We are both average weight and have more than enough room in seat."
20848,0,"I bought these when I thought I needed to sterilize pump parts all the time, which terms out to be an overkill. All the lactation specialists I've spoken to say you really don't have to sterilize them after the first time but I still try to at least once a week or so. These bags make it super easy. Just be careful not to burn yourself with the steam or water that may come out of the vent on the side of the bag."
145823,1,"This is a GREAT BOUNCER. Would recommend it to any parent. It's interactive, has different music choices that play longer than most toys. The swivelling seat is great...My son was 2 and a half months when we bought this and he was still too little to do much, plus his feet didn't touch the floor. He cried every time we put him in it until he was about 3 and a half months old. NOW he jumps and jumps and laughs and grabs at the animals and wheels. We still have to put a pillow under his feet because he can't reach the floor just yet, but he LOVES it. One thing he really liked, was if I started jumping and moving my arms around in front of him, he'd start copying me. Which is how he learned that he could bounce. :-)I highly recommend this product!"
15129,0,"Does anyone remember the 1980's Flash Gordon movie (the one with the soundtrack by Queen)? Inserting a diaper into this diaper genie reminds me of the scene when Flash is in Arboria and he's forced to participate in a Death Game with Prince Barin. They take turns sticking their arms into a hollow tree trunk that contains a Wood Beast. It has a sting that causes death after tortured madness.Besides that, the thing works great. I was skeptical that it was going to be able to contain the smell of old diapers, but it really does."
135382,1,This thing is great. Nothing wireless works in my condo due to interference. This set has given me no problems whatsover! Can hear baby breathing if I want to.
68853,0,Pampers is a good brand but they tend to leak. Huggies seems to be the best brand out of all diapers.
63545,1,"This is definitely one of the better mirror products we've tried. We have a baby with lots of reflux and spit-up issues, so I've needed to keep an eye on him while he's in the car seat to be sure he's not spitting up and choking. This product has a nice big mirror, convex so that it magnifies the baby well (especially if you can get the angle right), and Noah loves the puppy. He laughs every time he sees it. This product is PERFECT if you have an automobile with a center headrest in the back, or a car with an anchor on the back behind the seats. However, if you have an SUV with no center headrest, it becomes much more difficult. I've tried every trick I could think of, and wound up folding a stiff piece of fabric to go underneath it (works sort of as a pseudo headrest), and velcro to hold the fabric and bear on the leather seat. I also tied it off around the headrests on either side to stabilize it. It's now quite stable and in a good position, but the velcro doesn't stick well to leather so I have to restick it every so often. My final reaction is that although we love it, if I find something that has a better way to adhere to the back seat without a headrest, I'll probably switch it out and put the bearview on his crib instead. Grandma, who has a center headrest, is golden. For her, this product is perfect."
122429,1,"This ""Star Explosion"" is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It came quickly and I did not have any problems at all. Thanks you for great customer service."
109468,1,"This product is great for introducing fresh fruits to your baby, but I found it good for teething, as well. Sometimes my grandson wouldn't want to have a cold or frozen teether. I put a small ice cube in the netting and he loved sucking on it! It also gave him hydration. I recommend this product."
164925,2,It gets soggy in no time and leaks out big time . The product has lost its quality .I will never buy it again .
170305,1,My daughter just turned 1 year old. She's on the tiny side so I was concerned as to what type of carseat I was going to purchase. I read many reviews on Britax and it seemed like the company to go with. I loved the print of this and my daughter looks so cute in it. Not to mention that she finds it much easier to fall asleep in this seat than in her infant carrier. My husband said it was fairly easy to install and I know getting her in and out as well as adjusting the straps is a breeze. It was a perfect buy and I would recommendend to anyone!
171361,0,"I've used two different baby baths and this is not the better product.We registered for and own the Eurobath (which Amazon/BabiesRUs does sell.) but my wife and I recently took our baby on a trip to visit both sets of grandparents, both of whom separately purchased the Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub in anticipation of our visit. After having used this product for a few weeks, we were convinced that the Eurobath is a much better baby bathEurobath:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000056OV0/002-6256834-1036058?v=glanceWhy:This ""First Years - Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn to Toddler Tub"" is very small. In fact, I'm not sure I would really consider this bath a bath in the traditional sense. Instead, I see it more as seat where you can place the baby while you give them a sponge bath. The baby's body is almost completely out of the water, and there is little room around the baby for them to have any fun, splash in the water or to play with any bath toys. What room there is is only sufficient to rewet your washcloth or dip a cup to rinse off soap from the baby. Lastly, since this tub is so small, it will be quickly outgrown. Our baby is currently 7 months and average sized, and she'll be too large for this bath soon.The Eurobath, which costs just a few dollars more, also supports the infant/baby in a similar fashion - either reclining or sitting up, but the key difference is that the Eurobath is larger.Why does this make a difference?1) The Eurobath has higher sides which allow you to add more water in the tub. More water means that more of the baby can be in the water, which keeps the baby warmer. No one wants their baby catching a chill while bathing.2) The Eurobath is wider and longer which allows for a couple more inches of water around the baby, both front and sides. It's obvious that our baby loves the water around her and I can't count the videos we have of her giggling like crazy as she kicks both her legs and waves her arms in the water. At 7 months she still can't make enough of a splash to get us wet, but she sure seems to enjoy making small splashes and waves.3) Once your baby is old enough to sit up, the Eurobath provides enough room for them to play with their toys in the water in a manageable environment. Similar to how an adult sitting in a tub has a pool of water in front of them; the Eurobath does the same thing for a baby but on a smaller scale. While our baby only has a handful of plastic floating ducks as bath toys, its fun to watch her pick them up one by one and then put them back down and push them around. The Sure Comfort Deluxe did not have enough room or allow for enough water for our baby to do the same thing.4) The Eurobath because of it's larger size can be used by your baby longer. No one wants to waste money and buy more than one baby bath. The Eurobath works great from month 1 well through the first year.Sure Comfort Strengths - Two areas where the Sure Comfort beat the Eurobath are that because of it's smaller size the Sure Comfort will store easier, and second the Sure Comfort has a small padded headrest. Since we gently lay our baby's head down in the Eurobath the headrest has not been an issue, and the 25% larger storage footprint has not been a problem.In summary, our baby absolutely loves the Eurobath and always has fun in it. In the two weeks on our trip where we used the Sure Comfort Deluxe, our baby never seemed very happy in the bath and she was never able to have fun or play in the water like she does at home. While at 7 months we haven't started baby swim lessons yet, I am convinced that she's already starting to love the water because of her experiences in the Eurotub.Hope this helps."
49147,1,"I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the gate was to set up, adjust, and customize (interms of its lenght and shape)I would highly recommend this product.Great quality."
105737,2,"We are long-time users of the Diaper Champ. We first got one in 2003, and when we did, we LOVED it. One-handed operation, plus NO SMELL. None. We bought a second one a few years later when the first one pooped out (pun intended!)Recently we needed a new one, and went to buy one here. We noticed the design had changed -- maybe it was somehow easier to use? Because there was no way they could improve on the smell. Like I said, NO SMELL.But the new one lets those acrid aromatics seep through, particularly when you operate it. The smell is DEFINITELY coming through. I'm very disappointed. For so many years, this operated beautifully, and now they are like every other diaper pail on the market. Only twice the price.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
156414,1,"I used these until my son was 3 and then stopped using them sometime in the winter when he was 3. He is now 4 and hates having blankets on him when he's falling asleep but inevitably wakes me up every night 2-3 times to put the blanket on him since he can't do it himself yet or hasn't figured out how to do it in his sleep :) So I bought this hoping it would save him from waking us every night and it does. This is the largest size they make but it is roomy like the other sizes, so I know it will last til he can learn to do the blankets himself!"
39923,1,"I didn't find this until my daughter was almost a year old. I had my in-laws get it for her first birthday. It is amazing! We used to have the fan on our furnace/ac run from the time my daughter goes to bed until we go to bed... just to drown out our noise. With this machine, we can finally stop using the fan. I turn on the ocean sound, and turn it up as loud as it goes (and it's pretty loud!). This drowns out my cleaning (banging pots and pans) and the TV. When we go to bed, I keep it on, just turn it down a bit for her. I wish we would have found this sooner!!! I recommend it to everyone!"
101760,1,"I'd had my eye on this stroller bag for a while, and I bought it when the price was too good to pass up. This is a small bag that attaches with velcro to the metal bars on the side of a stroller, and gives you some extra room to hold a few essentials. Diapers, wipes, snack, sippy cup or bottle will all fit in there, and perhaps a few more smaller things. (I've never stuffed it to the brim.) Not gonna hold a ton of things, just carry your diaper bag if you need to bring a lot of stuff.I like the Saddle Bag because my Maclaren Quest has a small basket that is kind of a pain to get into if the kid is in the stroller. Hanging things from the handles causes the stroller to tip over backwards because it is so light. This product works great for a quick jaunt to the park. Also, if your stroller (like mine) has no baby bar in the front to hold the little darling's sippy cup, you can stick it in here. I got the navy color, and it is very nice. The quality is identical to the Skip Hop diaper bag I bought my husband, very durable and easy to care for. I may get another one for the other side of the stroller, I like this one so much."
151791,2,"I was rather disappointed with this when I received it. It's not easy to find a red changing pad cover, so I was excited to find this on Amazon. Well, the material is not as soft as I had expected and is somewhat thin. Not that big of a deal. However, what I hate about it is there are two small holes in the center of it for those dumb changing pad straps to fit through. Who actually straps in their baby when changing them? So, now you can see the white changing pad through those two holes and to the average Joe it looks like I have an old ratty changing pad cover that I should replace. Oh well."
133644,1,"Love this full foamy toilet-seat shaped potty ring! It's white with random-colored ducks at the back with an attached plastic hang ring. The 5.25x6in opening is a little bigger than what seems to be the average 5x6.5in opening. Because it's really cushioned, it's very high in profile. Munchkin has to climb another 3in foam mountain to get on top of the potty, possibly a bigger deal for little ones starting out with the stepstool, but probably not an issue with older/taller kids. Being so padded, it's surprisingly easy to carry around and fit in a larger (messenger) diaper bag.The only negative is that the plastic ring that hugs the toilet's seat is attached with 3 metal screws (1 back, 2 side, like a triangle) to the cushion. The plastic-to-foam can have a little separation between the 2 side/front screws, right where pee can hit and get between the cushion and plastic. However, all potty rings have this issue if they're not one piece. If you need a lower profile ring, the First YearsThe First Years Secure Adjust Toilet TrainerandDisney Pooh Soft Potty Seatare also good.***Update 02/2012***Still loving this potty ring. It's very easy for Munchkin to take on/off the potty. It cleans up *extremely* well and fast (we've done dishwasher sanitizing a couple times too...no heat on drying!!). The only complaint is that the version made for amazon yellowed within a month. The version made for WMT has still stayed white and clean. We've treated and cleaned them both with the same products, so i suspect the vinyl is different on the batches with the blue ring/multi-colored ducks vs the white ring/yellow-only ducks."
68020,2,We only used this bag once... it ripped on our very first use. It is not worth the money. Avoid.
181154,1,"I received this item as a baby present for my son. The Rainforest set offers a whole variety of things to stimulate a baby's sensory including light, sound, and touch. He became increasingly interested in this item when he was around 2.5 months old. The gym comes with detachable toys such as a rattler, a jingling parrot, a mirror, and plush toys. Very colorful, and hours of fun!"
25598,2,"I have only used this cup once, and it leaked. Probably this is due to not assembling all the parts to the lid correctly, as other reviewers have noted. But come on! There are 4 different parts to the lid!! Who designed this? The fact that this cup is safe and BPA-free does NOT make up for such poor design."
40383,2,"Like the other reviewers, I have bought diapers from Amazon for months. Now, I will be going to local grocery and discount tore for them instead. A $3 price increase in less than a month is CRAZY to say the least. I hope that everyone shows Amazon and doesn't buy these diapers from them at such a crazy inflated price!"
129418,1,good for me are perfectthis is beautiful and i like it a lotthanks for the puntuality on the shipment
93948,1,"We just received our playpen and as soon as we'd opened the box we knew we'd made the right choice. After lots of research we chose this one based on a number of factors;1. Quite large (room to play) compared with others.2. Not many more $ than the cheap plastic ones.(By the way i've searched the web and this one from Babyride.com @ $199.99 is by far the cheapest as the vinyl is the 2006 colors- who cares).3. Washable vinyl floor and the fact that it is off the floor is great.4. you can't beat wood, it looks great.5. Made in Germany as opposed to China. Quality product.I might add that if the bear patterned vinyl is not your thing (it's not mine), Amazon currently has a sale on the bumper padding (which also has a floor pad attached so you can change the look), we got the red one so you can't see the bears anymore, i'd recommend getting this anyway as extra padding's never a bad thing.Overall very happy with this product and the seller."
123191,1,"My 11 month old grandson loves this for playing and napping. PERFECT for the lake, easy to set up and take down, light weight and convenient! Recommended if you want a traditional playpen! Haven't found anything I don't like about it, fits nicely in our travel trailer."
85134,1,"This pillow is awesome! I am 17 weeks pregnant, 5'7, about 150 lbs. and it fits me great. Before becoming pregnant I was a stomach sleeper so I had to find a new position early on. Before this pillow I was using several pillows propped around me to support my back, legs and tummy while trying to get comfortable on my side. This pillow does it all. It is large, but it fits in my queen size bed with both me and my husband without disturbing him. The pillow did arrive with a small tear in the cover but I contacted Baby Age and they immediately sent me a new cover (which arrived only 2 days after I contacted them). Using the pillow is a little hot at times (I am in a hot climate, Louisiana) but I think it would be hard to get around that with the way the pillow swaddles and supports your whole body. The case is polyester, which may contribute to some of the heat, but it is soft and comfortable (and I am very very picky about textures with everything. I was a little hesitant to purchase this because it said it was non- returnable but I couldn't be happier. I am 100% satisfied and recommend it to everyone. Also our bed is a Tempur-Pedic which I'm sure adds to my comfort- it's another must have for everyone."
52988,1,We had another swing for our 8 week old baby and everytime I'd put her in it she just screamed. We thought she just didn't like swings. I went to the local Babies r us store and saw this swing and thought how soft and comfy it looked and attractive too so I thought I'd give it a try. I put it together as soon as I got home as I couldn't wait for my husband to get home from work I wanted to try it out right away.It was very simple to assemble all I needed was a phillips head screwdriver. The instruction book walked you through assembly with pictures and words. As soon as it was assembled I put my 8 week old in it and she loved it!!! It was a miracle!! She watched the moblile overhead and coo'd at it and then promptly fell asleep for 4 hours!!! Now she's been in it everyday since and she falls fast asleep. My husband and I just wish they would have had this swing weeks ago.
67641,1,"Seems like it works great so far. My daughter says she's comfortable in it, and looks happier being in her big-girl car seat. The 5-point restraint car seat is still the best for her, as she is just 35 pounds, so I'm using this booster as the ""extra"" for now, like when she needs to go on classroom field trips or we ride in grandma's or a friend's car. I also like that this car seat eventually converts to a backless booster that she can keep using as long as legally required in our state. The only drawback is that this is a car seat that requires parents' teaching and limit-setting with those independent kiddos that figure out they can unbuckle by themselves now! One thing about the Britax that we still use in my car -- she cannot unbuckle that thing by herself, which affords me a lot of security on the road."
9178,1,"I'm really surprised by all of the negative reviews. I was skeptical about this product but registered for it anyway because I couldn't find anything else with such a convenient ""crib-side"" design. My daughter is almost 8 months old and we turn it on every night using the timer setting and the batteries have never run out. It's quiet compared to normal CD players, but if we turned it up all the way it would be too loud for bedtime. I would highly recommend this product."
124265,2,i installed it with the max number of tightness possible and you can still open the lid a good 4 inches. enough for my 16 month old to open it and stick his hand in. was definitely looking for a tight fit.
76253,1,"First of all, each cube is about 1/2 an ounce, not an ounce as the description says. But this is a great product! I can freeze my pumped milk in smaller portions, so that we don't defrost too much at a time, leading to less waste. The trays are covered, which keeps freezer funk from getting to the milk. They've been fine on the top rack of my dishwasher, and having two of them works out great so I can use one and clean one at a time."
160323,0,"When preparing to have our first child I bought one of each kind of swaddle, not knowing what we would like the best. We've also tried the standard 'receiving' blanket and some nice stretchy ones. This one we liked the least. My baby wiggles a lot when settling for sleep and every time she moved she would hear the velcro coming apart a little and it would bother her. She had a very hard time falling asleep in it. The Miracle blanket works best for her because it does a better job at keeping her arms down than others and doesn't have noisy velcro on it. I've also tried the sleep sacks. As she's getting more and more arm control I'm finding that she is slowly liking the ""Halo Sleep Sack"" better, but at night she still needs her arms confined. I also like the sleep sack idea because it is only one layer of blanket (where this SwaddleMe is two in the front when closed. The other thing I didn't like about the SwaddleMe or the Miracle Blanket is that with my baby's wiggling she invariably ends up with a gap between the feet sack and the top part and since we tend to use t-shirts rather than onsies her belly gets exposed and cold. So, I wouldn't recommend this for an active, noise sensitive baby."
142075,2,"This is not a memory foam mattress. It is a spring coil mattress with a thick plastic cover. It feels like you are on an airbed or pool float. I am not one to bother with returning items but this was such a disappointment I was planning on going through the trouble for once. However, the return fee was almost as much as the mattress. So It is currently being used as a box springs for my daughters thinner crib mattress with a memory foam mattress topper. If you want memory foam this is not the mattress for you. I almost considered making it a dog bed but it was not comfy enough for even my dogs to sleep on."
85638,1,I love this changing table. It's sturdy and has a great finish. It's beautiful and looks great in my daughter's room. I couldn't be happier with it. I would def recommend this to a friend.
68260,1,"I already own one of these cases, but loved it so much I have purchased another one for the car and another for my friend who is expecting. It is nice because you can put 2-3 diapers in there (currently using size 4), a disposable changing pad, and a thin wipe case. I do not remember what I did without it, everything is right there now."
96460,0,It is a bit too big for ordinary lever lock. I wish it is a bit smaller so that the locking mechanism can be reached more easily. Also it is a bit hard to use it with one hand.
42562,0,"I just got tired of wrapping and unwrapping and trying to get it to work. The ends hung on the ground and I was scared the baby would fall out as I put her in it. Basically, I wanted something I could throw on at the store and slide her into and go, and this was not it. She would go from fitting in snug to slipping out within 5 minutes and she only weighed 10 lbs. I guess I may have been wrapping it wrong, but the Baby Bjorn was so much easier and I didn't have to ""learn"" how to use it. I just picked that up for $10 less than the Moby at a second hand store."
10603,1,"A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers. I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold, and fortunately, received these. They are large - 27&quot;x 27&quot; square and are essential for baby care. I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old. I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day. They work great as burp cloths, and are superb for wiping up other food messes. Additionally, I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months. Extremely durable, fold-up rather small for travel, and launder well. 101 uses, I love them!"
89169,1,"No diaper is perfect, that's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. These are however the best we've used so far (and we've used quite a lot of different brands and types). Fewer blow-outs and seems to hold a lot of pee overnight. Thumbs up :)"
107589,2,These sunshades are extremely bad. They do not stick what ever you do. They are heavy and fall on children every time. I do not understand how are these kind of products are allowed to be in market especially when they are made for kids.Munchkin Two White Hot Safety Sunblock Shade-Black
181541,2,"I adopted a one year old small cat. Thought this gate would allow me to keep the garden door open to get fresh air, yet stop the small cat from jumping over it to to get out to the garden. Well, I was wrong!! The cat took one graceful jump over the gate to the garden and I had to run out to keep it from escaping. If you have a relatively fit cat, don't bother with this product. This gate is no higher than a kitchen counter. And we all know that cats jump up on counters all the time. I should have thought about that before I bought this gate. What a waste of $30 dollars."
110821,0,These work great as a soother than a tooth brush. Its not that simple to brush a 6 months old mouth because the end piece is quite large for a babys mouth. I can see it used as a toothbrush but it doesnt look very effective for the baby since you cant really move it side to side to help gently scrub the baby's tooth
75124,1,i love the fact that he is not peeing on people or his crib when i change him. not having to wash his bedding
114009,2,"I had bought this for my son at 6 months old for visiting graqndparents. I really liked the features, but didn't like it once i put my son in it. I loved the idea that it folded up, had a carrying strap, could come apart easily to clean, and the different trays. I thought that the back could be a little higher, he still needed some support, and couldn't sit straight up. Also he is an average size baby, and when i put him in the seat he had just fit, and the seat looked really small with him in it. I returned and bought him a reclining seat with a higher back."
576,1,I have used Pampers ever since my son was born and I have yet had a wet bed an occasional blow out but these diapers keep my baby dry no rashes and holds alot of urine. I will never switch worth the price and even cheaper if you subscribe
13374,1,"It truly makes a difference on your back &amp; hips during pregnancy. I would get this early for yourself or a mommy to be. The best part is that not only is it great during pregnancy and for nursing, but you will continue to use it later on (like when you at the computer, etc)!"
125594,1,"I bought this for my 6 mo old grandson and he LOVES it. He chews and chews and drools and drools! The first day he used it, he chewed so much his gums were a little bit sore the next day. However, the following day he grabbed for it again and chowed down! He's kind of a picky baby and not many things seem to entertain him for long periods of time. He especially didn't seem to like any of the teethers he has and just wouldn't use them, but he plays with this teether for hours!! In fact, I came back to Amazon to order a couple more. This worked out great for us."
148776,0,"Overall comfy, but seam does rub. It is too large for any bed but a King. Further, If you are taller than 5'8, it is not long enough to go between your legs are well. Provides good support."
73769,1,"It's not perfect, it can't do all the things an app would do but it's not meant to be complex and it's very handy.I've been using this everyday for 5 weeks. When baby is fussing, I check how long it's been since feeding or diaper change. I use it throughout the day but it's especially helpful at night and when someone else is watching baby (no need to ask me when last diaper change or feeding was).The nightlight feature is handy too because it shuts off on it's own.The only improvement to this simple gadget would be to add a function that keeps track of how many total feedings in a day."
32859,1,"I didn't get this carrier right off the bat because it was so expensive. I was having a hard time justifying the expense, when we didn't really go to many places that we needed a carrier.We were given a hand me down Snuggli and the contraption was such a pain to get into and out of (FOR ME!! NEVER MIND MY DAUGHTER!!)and it made my back hurt so badly that I gave it away and said I'd carry her first! Then we scheduled a trip to the zoo, and we wanted our daughter to be able to see all the animals instead of being in a stroller, so I just broke down and bought the Baby Bjorn because of all the great reviews it got.WHAT A DIFFERENCE DESIGN MAKES!!! I could get in and out of this by myself (my husband had to put the Snuggli on me, for crying out loud) and I could get my 18 lb. daughter into it with no problems either. It also seemed to provide her with a lot more support, and it took an entire afternoon before I even started feeling the effects of carrying her!This thing's the BEST! And we use it all the time!!"
43707,1,"We bought two of these extensions for the Hands Free Gate that we use for our triplets that just turned a year old. This gate including extensions are a lifesaver! You can read my review on the gate as well, lol. The extensions are very easy to add and very sturday. Adding them does not make the gate weaker by extending it out like some gates do. It is just what it states, an extension. It keeps it just as strong as sturdy! Worth the money!"
84358,2,"I was so excited to get my one year old a swing, and this was just such a disappointment. It's meant to hang from a tree branch or pre-existing swing set, which isn't mentioned anywhere in the description. We were going to put eye-hooks in our porch roof, but it actually recommends against using the hooks (or even really the swing set for that matter), due to the potential for creating metal shavings. Considering how many swing sets are metal on metal, it makes me think it must be some awfully cheap not very sturdy metal that they use. Second, we tried roping it around a sturdy part of the trellis since we don't have any trees in the desert, and it hung about 5 feet off the ground. Much too high for comfort. Then, to make matters MORE annoying, it didn't matter what we did, it would not level out. We tried adjusting the ropes behind the seat like the directions said, and they never budged. Great I supposed for peace of mind once it's installed properly, but no amount of pushing, pulling, or maneuvering was going to get those things to move. So, it's since been pulled back down, and will be returned as soon as the holidays are done. What a horrible disappointment.Also note, if you so much as glance at this, you'll realize that it is NOT a dual restraint system - the tray is just a tray, easily removable, and will NOT keep your child in the swing."
24844,1,"The King of baby gates. I almost didn't buy this because consumer reports didn't rate it well especially on the safety dimension. I don't know what they were smoking, because this is an awesome baby gate. It is so easy to get through yet it is solid and kid proof. I was afraid that the little one would be able to depress the foot pedal. NOT SO. My one year old can't budge it. My three year old can move it a little, but not anywhere enough to open it. My six year old has to jump up and down on it a little, but can open it. For me, no handed operation is a dream come true. Perfect gate."
58164,1,"It would have been really nice to know that it needed batteries before I got the thing together and then went to have our little one play with it. He would probably be more interested in it had there been a bit more exciting noises coming from it. Other than that we like it and he does too, but only after we have to sit him in front of it and make it seem exciting enough to play with. He's our little techy who loves noises when at play with his toys. Nothing we couldn't fix of course when I finally did get the time and remember that we needed batteries =)"
47097,0,"I have three kids (8, 3 & 1mo), and this was more for the two younger ones to share. While the stroller is sturdy, and I like the big wheels, I don't know how anyone could label this ""ultralight"". Granted, I've never owened any tandem strollers, but this is heavy enough that my wife has hard time using it on her own. And with the infant carrier adapter attached, it takes up the entire trunk of my Ford Expedition (the wheels touch the back of the 2nd row, and the other side reaches all the way to the liftgate - I have the regular length Expedition, not the EL though). So, unless you have a large SUV, I'm not sure how convenient it would be to carry around in a regular car.I have had both my older kids sit on the back seat together at Disneyland and Stearns' Wharf, and the stroller worked fine. So, I'm quite confident of the studiness. However, compared to Peg Perego I own, it seems to be put together very crudely (or cheaply? you'll see what I mean when you see it in person). The handle bar, for example, is just metal bar covered with a neoprene/foam cushion. The lock is just metal hinge that you have to manually lock in, instead of some automatic system. The infant carrier is just ""strapped"" on to the stroller (it's the red strap you see on the pics), not 'locked in' somehow.So, although I appreciate for what it is, my wife and I both agree that we do not like it as much as the other strollers that we've used."
41902,1,"This is the most wonderful product! The lamb face is darling, and the softness of the toy makes it perfect for a newborn."
68339,0,"My 1-year-old son has had a difficult time finding sippy cups he likes. He really didn't take to any of them, until these. It was an easy step from a bottle, and the soft tips make drinking pretty easy.However, they really could be better. In no particular order...(1) They're not very leak-proof at all. Sure, some of it is that my kid's not very careful, but they'll spill a bit whenever they're dropped. It's a sippy cup; it *will* get dropped! Also, because of the tip design, a little bit of water or juice or whatever will be left at the top when the kid's done; this will spill, too.(2) The tip isn't well-vented and gets sucked into the cup. As our son drinks, it gets worse and worse, almost turning itself inside out. I need to squeeze the tip to let air in, and let the tip return to its form, regularly. This also makes for more messy drinking.(3) One of the bottles just cracked from being dropped. Yep, it'll happen, but these are more fragile than the other sippy cups we've bought.So, on the plus side, my kid loves them and drinks from them without complaint. On the minus side, they're kind of awful in a few ways and much messier than most other sippy cups. I guess that makes them three-star.I'd only recommend these as a transition step away from a bottle, or if your kid is having trouble with other sippy cups."
67106,1,"Bought this for my three year old who was requesting a princess bed. She loves it! Very easy to put together, I did it by myself while my husband is a work."
131285,1,"This was perfect for a trip with my 9 month old. Any chair became a high chair, which was perfect for the airport, beach restaurants, and our rented condo. Highly recommend! Its size make it very convenient to keep attached to the diaper bag for use at a moment's notice."
100825,1,"They're great diapers. Especially for my 9 month old son. They are the ONLY diapers my son doesnt soil through through the night! They fit great, and he's very mobile, but the diapers support well anyways. I ordered these with standard shipping and got them the very next day. Very recommended"
161103,0,"Ditto the previous two reviews -- our son is 15 mo and the cover on his original changing pad is shredded. Not only does the badly-torn plastic mean that urine can now get into the pad itself, but also, because the pad is so thin, without the extra strength of the intact plastic covering, the pad can't stay flat when covered with an elastic-cornered cover. So I have a shredded, potentially peed-upon, arched-up pad at the moment that I have to flatten out with one hand before I put my baby on it with the other. That's just unnecessary stress.I debated getting another kind b/c this one is so cheaply made, but we have a DaVinci table, I prefer the flat pads, and this is what fits. So - I know I'm going to be annoyed as soon as the new one rips (and I know it will), but I'm getting it anyway, because there aren't a lot of options. The rips happen, btw, when the baby kicks or flips on the table - he pulls one way with his hand and pushes the other with his knee, and the plastic rips in half. I really don't think it's unexpected that a baby would act this way on the changing table, so - crappy design, people!I would like to see someone make a flat pad the same size as this one, except twice as thick (so it would have a better chance of laying flat inside a fitted cover), and with the kind of durable plastic cover that the contoured pads have."
164607,1,"I have used these diapers with both of my children. They were the only ones that didn't leak or explode. Plus you get the Gifts to Grow reward points, which are a great bonus!"
30343,1,"One of the bolts was just a touch difficult to get in place, but once that was done, the transformation of the crib into a beautiful bed was complete. Honestly, our son's bed is now nicer than our own bed, no joke. The only reason I did not give 5 starts was the difficulty of putting the one bolt in place, which I read that some other people had similar difficulty."
83983,1,This is great for restaurants or going to friends houses to protect their table/tablecloths. Easy to clean and store. I have bought them for each of my grandchildren.
107084,2,"Here is a 3 step plan to save your money on either of these ""pails"" AND on the bags. AND keep a cleaner house at the same time.1. Put the dirty diaper in an old Wal-Mart or other grocery bag.2. Twist and tie the bag tightly. Repeat if really bad.3. Walk the bag out to the trash outside if it smells really bad.Total Cost $0.00.Remember only you can prevent your house from being a LANDFILL!"
80837,1,I prefer easy up over the Huggies Pull ups because they hold more and they also stay in place. Every time my daughter wore the Huggies pull ups they always moved to one side. These are thicker than the pull ups though and is very much like a diaper. They are stretchy on the sides though and the best way to change an accident on them is to just rip the sides.
158986,1,"My cousin let me use her Snugli carrier when I had my baby. I thought it was horrible - there was no support at all. I had to hold onto the back of my baby's head the entire time and he did nothing but cry while he was in it. I gave her Snugli back to her and bought the Eddie Bauer one instead. I do agree with the other reviewers in that the straps slip and there is no way to keep them from doing so. However, it's very gradual (happens more/faster when you're doing vigorous activities) and it's not a huge deal to tug on the straps to pull them tighter. Also, it only took me one time putting it on to have the straps all figured out, and as long as you pull it off in a normal fashion the straps don't get all twisted and you can put it on easily the next time. I will say that the baby likes it a lot. He's seems very comfortable; his head is supported and he falls asleep every time I put him in it. I also find it to be comfortable for me to wear...well, as comfortable as you can be with a baby strapped to the front of your body while you vacuum!"
84678,1,I purchased care rails for my grandchild to use. My husband installed this one while I installed the spindle mount kit. Both were easy to install and are great for stair safety.
115033,1,"I really like this pump so far. A friend told me about this pump. I only had a single pump and I wanted a double pump to collect more milk. But all the pumps I was told to buy are very expensive. But since everyone spoke about the other pumps of course I was looking to spend all that money. I bought this pump about a week ago, and it works just fine. I get out as much and I hope soon more as I was while using the expensive single pump. The only thing you might have to do is make sure the milk goes down but it's no problem. It also saves me time now since I'm back at work! I really do like this and for the price I love it, but like all electronics you hope it all keeps working. So it's all about what you like. Just because both of the pumps worked for me doesn't mean it will work for you. But it works just as well as the expensive Medela single pump."
7882,0,This item is very cute and durable I used the blue and brown one's for my first child almost 7 years ago at that time they were sold in stores. I was happy to find this product online as the new pacifier holders seem to be specific for only one type of pacifier as this one can be used for different models and types.
17892,2,If you are going to buy this you might as well get a second play yard...I did not notice a big difference with this...I don't believe it is as much square feet as they say....hmmm
166354,1,"We have primarily used Pampers for our son, but often struggle at availability of the specific types of diapers and/or sizes.Subscribing for a continual delivery of Pampers diapers has been the greatest addition to our life. We both work and trying to get to the store to buy diapers is always a juggling act between the two kids and life in general. Through this subscription process, we never have to worry about not having the right diapers as we can adjust the deliveries to meet our timeframes. Additionally, the convenience of coming home to delivered diapers is a blessing!"
124824,1,"We tried several different monitors. We live in an apartment complex and kept picking up people's phone conversations and radios and such. This was the first one we tried that didn't. We had tried about 3 higher priced ones prior to this one. I LOVE the night light feature. The only problem is that it burned out after about 5 months of use. I have also only encountered a problem with the battery charge once, and that was after about 6 hours of on-off time throughout the day. I was planing on buying a new one of the same, but with the upgraded one with temperature reading and such, I think we'll just go for that."
142930,0,"Don't buy this gate if you have carpel tunnel, it's not that easy to open and close. It is acceptable otherwise, but is not always a ""one hand"" operation. I have only mild carpel tunnel and many days I need both hands to open this gate."
71603,1,Wonderful toy box for toddlers. No sharp corners to fall on and just the right height.
1884,1,I make sure I reorder every few monthsLove this offer and these diapers are excellentI highly recommend these diapers
30392,0,"I got this tub for my daughter because i liked the shower spray. The shower spray works great and I really love that part, but the sling/seat I didn't like. It didn't really hold the baby well. She always slid down it. I had to keep pulling her up. I think with the next baby I will get one that the baby sinks into the seat. I think the tub/spray will be good when my daughter can sit up on her own."
139248,1,I purchased this thinking it would be just a cute little inexpensive present for my daughter for Christmas. I was genuinely surprised how neat it was. The stars that show up on the cieling are very bright and easy to see. The little bookelt that comes with it helps you pick out the shapes in the stars. All in all a great buy!
159380,2,"My son hates the music in this bouncer. He hates staying in it pretty much and i have to rock him in it to make him feel comfy. I registered for this because I heard it was magnificent. The play pen that matches this is very nice, but the music in this chair is the biggest turn off. It isn't soft and gentle, like other things we have. The music is clunky and low, almost eerie and mystifying, my son looks as if he is going to cry when I turn it on, so I put it on the ocean sounds instead. He is also uninterested in the fish and water scene, whereas he loves the ocean mobile on the matching playpen, which also has softer music, go figure!!!!! I would not recommend thisproduct, but the playpen is wonderful and colorful."
14415,2,"...I really wanted to get him used to the bottle so that I could leave him with my brother, and nothing else worked so I tried the Avent. Well, it didn't work either. My kid preferred the real thing. I guess the Avent doesn't work for everybody...."
65604,0,fabric is very poor and thin. i'd rather pay little more and get better quality.
152806,1,"After reviewing many different seats, I chose this one for the many features including the comfortable seat padding and the 2 set of cup holders. There is also another version that has night lights in the headrest that you may want to consider if doing a lot of night travel. Overall I am very satisfied however, it does not recline and my son's head will bob while napping. That is the one improvement I would suggest to Evenflo."
71916,1,"I read the reviews before I bought this product and I am glad I did. It was exactly what I needed. However, my daughter will outgrow this seat before long. Be mindful if you are having a big baby. My bundle of joy was 9 lbs, 12 ounces and I will be needing to get a new seat very soon. Otherwise, great product!"
1450,0,diapers are good but doesn't have trace line(changes color when it is wet)...i would prefer Pampers swaddel next time. diapers are good but doesn't have trace line(changes color when it is wet)...i would prefer Pampers swaddel next time.
24821,1,"works great! my child can not open it. i have 2 of these installed. buy the extension if you have wider opening. if you have even wider opening - place a piece of wood next to the wall, i added an extra piece of 2x4 for one of the wide opening in the house. it gives the extra 2 inches needed and also protects the wall.hands free operation is very handy when you have to hold the child or carry other stuff."
21608,1,"My daughter loves this bouncer. She is now three months old and we have had it since birth. It is the only place that she enjoyed sitting for the first two months, as she didn't seem to be a big swing fan. It was the only way I got a shower, hair dried, or a meal eaten.We initially bought this because my husband picked it out. He loved that it had ""surround sound"" and bright colors.I loved that it seemed so large and sturdy, and that the toys could flip off to the sides and be removed or stored in the bottom legs.Our daughter loves this more than we ever imagined. We aren't annoyed by the music, and the lower volume is great. I like the vibration and it doesn't eat batteries. We are still operating on the same batteries since birth! Three months!She LOVES the toys. She has yet to discover the mobile, as it is so far above her little head, but she loves the rest, especially the music setting (interactive) where her own motion and batting of the toys sets the music off.Great product and will work for her for a long time because of it's sturdy size and how high it sits off the floor."
147863,0,"I've had this basket for almost three years now and it has held up just fine, including monthly washings of the liner. We spray painted it white with basic paint to match the nursery and it stuck.After no complaints for some time though, I am compelled to write a review because I actually cut my finger on the bottom of it when I turned it upside down to sort the laundry. I know small sharp edges are to be expected with a product made of natural materials, but this is beyond what is acceptable. I am going to need to cover it with felt or something so my little one isn't injured."
20835,1,These bags are super convenient and easy to use. When my son was born I was a super uptight new mom and wanted to sterilize his things frequently this was much easier than boiling water etc.. I still use these for new teethers and new sippy cups.
7721,2,"This is a great scent, at a department store. I tested Macy's vs this because the scent only lasted mere minutes and here's the deal, this one goes on really strong and chemical smelling and doesn't last. One from store lasted 7x longer +. Also, can't return fragrances to amazon because they are flammable! Don't cheap out and make the same mistake I did!!!!!"
166505,2,"I prefer the Pampers Swaddler, It was my mistake I got the wrong kind but had already placed my order and didnt realize that they weren't swaddler. Gave my poor baby a rash. These diapers are too thin for my baby. Not pleased at all"
90535,0,I have been using these diapers for over a year now since Luvs changed their diapers and my kids were constantly wet. I really like these diapers but my daughter occassionally leaks through them during the night.I haven't had any other problems with them. I will continue to use themunless I find a diaper that is better. I have always bought thse diapers through amazon mom but with the recent price increase your better off just going to your nearest wholesale store cause the price difference isn't that much.
124810,2,"Unfortunately, I have two of these pumps. Both of which are broken. The first one worked well for two months; however, milk backs up into the pump and you have continually keep pulling it off. Then of course, the motor burns out. The second I have worked for exactly two weeks before the same thing happened.Save your money for something else especially since these are not returnable. Your better off using a manual pump."
151315,1,"We bought another mirror and it wouldn't stay in place and also didn't give the best angle to see the baby in the back seat of my Ford Flex. This mirror mounts easily, stays in place and offers a great view of the little one!"
14650,1,"I got my first bottles as a gift from a friend, the bottle works great, easy to clean doesnt cause gas &amp; my baby seems happy with it. BUT rarely, it leaks from the ring, which many just mention. The price is higher than most brand. I will suggest the sample pack that comes 1 X 9oz, 1X4 oz, 1X disposable nurser+liner, pacifier &amp; travel carrier for nipples for $ 19.99 , that is the cheapest way you can try it with min dollar..."
21653,1,"I love this Malawi bedding. It is so soft, and made of good quality. The mattress sheet did rip in the corner, but that could be because I wash all bedding in hot water and it may have shrunk a little bit. It is perfect for a boy or girl. We used this for our son who was born in August 2003, and we will be using it for our daughter due in September 2005. We even got my son the Malawi toddler bed set for his toddler bed. We had our home on the market this last January and about 90 percent of people looking at our home complimented the nursery. The valance was a big hit! One lady even asked if we would consider leaving the nursery decor, as she was expecting, of course that was a big NO WAY, as we are expecting in September 2005. I would highly recommend this product!"
25308,0,"Great concept and the mesh pocket is very handy. The product however, comes apart at the seams, and tears easily away from it's trim. I have gone through a few now because I liked the color and pocket, but will be trying another type."
183869,1,I like this set. I got everything I needed in one set different colors too. It is a great product very much recommended.
29649,1,"Oh how i wish i could change the number of stars!!! After 32 months of using these diapers, we have come to the conclusion that only size 4 work. My oldest baby just outgrew them and we stepped up to size 5 only to have the same problems that we did with size 1, 2, and 3. THEY LEAK!!! there is NO ELASTIC to speak of and the quality is just not there. I am on a first name basis with some of the people at 7th gen now and it's too bad because they seem like nice, well-meaning people but after you change the sheets, their clothes, your clothes, playmats, swings, carseats, bjorn, etc... 5 times a night-- and if the little baby is in a onsie, well then a bath is usually needed.the absolute worse part is the traumatized child who has to go through the wetness, the clean up, and the tears. and then there's the other child who is waiting in the wings for all the drama to be over. ""breach in the britches"" is the term we've coined to help them understand what's going on so they aren't so upset.i LOVE the natural paper bag color and lack of fragrance. if they could get together with P&G; and make a pampers cruiser with these elements, call them ""DUETS"", they would be the ultimate diaper in history. until then, i will suffer through headaches from the bleach-whitened, fake perfume stink of pampers just so my children can sleep through a night or go out in public without catastrophic occurances.I've emailed both companies and P&G; claims they are trying to mask the odor of urine on paper. but when urine hits the pampers, it just intensifies the nasty perfume smell. the only good thing about it is you know when they go.7th gen just doesn't care I guess. they say they've change manufactures but it just make sense that a diaper would have elastic in it? they say it's ""user error."" ok. we're done. and after finding black mold in the wipes, ""sometimes our formula is off,"" and having them not separate from one another, i could be finished with these as well.love their dishwashing liquid and laundry detergent but never again will i ever buy one of their diapers. And can you imagine how mortified a child would be in their training pants. It would train them very quickly if for no other reason than to avoid the humiliation. not a very loving approach."
166575,0,"These diapers don't work as well as the Swaddlers I was using previously. Every morning my baby wakes up with wet clothes. I thought maybe it was because he was getting older, or somehow producing more urine, but I had a few of the swaddlers left over so I tried those for a couple of nights. He woke up with perfectly dry clothes.Dissapointed, now I have a whole box of these to use up!"
95355,1,"Overall, we're happy with this monitor - the reception is very clear and we can hear our daughter's slighest sounds. But we did have trouble unscrewing the battery cover - the screw is so fragile and it gets easily stripped. I could not even remove the cover at all. We returned the first monitor and had the same problem with the replacement - we decided to leave the screw out and just snap in the battery cover. My advice - keep the box/packaging and receipt until you're sure all parts of the monitor work, in case you need to return/exchange it."
36156,2,This thing was too long. It wasn't what i expected. I lost my money. Can't even used it and cannot returned it because I already put the receipt in the garbage. What a waste!!!!!!!
146940,1,"Skip Hop 20 Piece 70""x56"" PlaySpot Floor Mat, Pink/BrownI have an 8 month old girl. My baby loves playing in the stylish mat. She is able to turn and trying to craw without hitting herself. It is so easy to assembly and clean. My baby is happy with it."
177210,1,"I like this table very much. I suggest having your husband or just a guy put it together as other women on this site say it isn't sturdy enough. It's VERY sturdy for me. It doesn't wobble a bit. The only thing I seem to have trouble with is finding a good changing table cover for the pad. It seems the only ones out there are the ones for the changing table contoured pad or whatever. If anyone knows please let me know as I am using travel crib sheets that almost fit but are a bit too big and bunch up and it's a hassle. Another cover I found is a bit too small but does fit if I STUFF the pad in there and i mean STUFF and looks funny but I have no other options right now. Either way I am still managing. Anyway, the shelves are a nice feature. I put baskets on them and fill them with diapers and packs of wipes and things like that. Very attrective. The table to me, is pretty good, and it fit our budget. So, for Moms on a tighter budget, I do recommend this table as it has been proving itself to me so far."
179886,1,"Bought this blanket for my son's first child. They do not use it every day, but when the baby was fussy, it calmed him immediately. I believe it made him feel secure, as when he was in the womb. Stays securely wrapped and does not come undone as regular receiving blanket do. Great invention that is safe for a newborn. Would buy again and also recommend to others."
167629,1,We now have two miracle blankets and they are sanity savers! Our son is 9 weeks old and sleeps so well in these bkankets. They are my new go to gift for any new baby!
16191,1,I love having this to take to the park or event outside. The fabric can just be wiped off and it folds back up easily and nicely. Perfect size for a family of 4 or a couple. I keep mine in the back of my car just in case.
167238,1,I am a true believer of Britax car seats. I own 5 of them.The marathon is my go to. I like to use it in our truck as it is narrow and with traveling. It is easy to install and my kids are very comfortable.Will continue to buy. I have had great success with Customer Services.
137815,1,"Our two and a half year old loves this turtle. I'm impressed with how well the stars project onto the ceiling and walls. We like the three different colors you can choose from, and that it has a timer and turns itself off after our daughter has fallen asleep. This was her favorite gift this Christmas."
107150,2,"I've read all of the reviews of those of you who can't understand why the rest of us hated our Diaper Champs, and I just have to say-give it a while, you'll find out. We bought our Diaper Champ when our first son was born. For pretty much the first year we LOVED it. Everyone is right, you don't have to spend money on seperate bags, it's a nice height so you don't have to bend over it and it's really easy to use. I think it takes about a year though, or maybe even a little longer, and it will start to reek so bad that you'll want to sleep at the neighbors house just to escape the smell. For all of you who haven't used yours long enough-just wait, it will happen. We scrubbed ours with bleach, we emptied it daily, we aired it out in the backyard for two days, and then we finally started putting every single diaper in ziplock bags before putting them in the diaper champ (so much for no extra bags!). NOTHING helped. I'm not stupid, I understand that when it comes to diapers, nothing is smell proof. We emptied it all the time and disinfected it constantly. But I'm not talking normal stinky diaper smell. I'm talking the combined smell of every stinky diaper in the entire world. It was SO BAD. Unless you plan on potty training your child when he turns one, and good luck with that, you'll probably end up replacing yours before the diaper days are over. In the end we bought a Diaper Genie. We've used it for two years now and have had no problems. It kinda stinks a little when you open it, but the smell stays in there when it's closed. I'll buy seperate bags any day if I never have to smell that foul Diaper Champ again."
17555,2,"I got this as a shower gift, and also loved all its features. But after owning it for almost a year now and many many washes the padding fell apart, and the batting fell out. Baby Trend was not all that plesent to deal with, and after waiting almost 6 weeks for a replacement pad i was very upset to recieve it with the seams torn and the batting again coming out.All Baby Trend offered to do was to again replace the pad...but this should be recalled before someones child chokes on it loose materials."
108539,2,"This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy. The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin, it can be quite painful. I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat, it looks like it would be more comfortable"
155602,1,This is one of my favorite toddler products. It's compact and portable. It's easy to set up and clean up. I don't understand why some reviewers said they are not sturdy. The legs have to be snapped in (and they snap in easily). This has made traveling so much less stressful! My toddler has also used it when the bathrooms at the parks were closed or too dirty. And she thinks using this potty is a novelty and will say she needs to use the potty just so she can sit on it. I highly recommend it!
152687,1,"I knew I wanted a side by side We had a front to back double for my daughter and nephew and one was always kicking the seat of the other. I debated between the combi, peg-perego and this one. I ruled out the combi because a friend of mine had it and I didn't like that the seats didn't sit straight up and that they seemed kind of flimsy {even when buckled in my daughter could stand straight up, the seat just moved up with her}. I ruled out the peg-perego because of online reviews about the basket dragging when too much stuff was in it, and also because when we put our 2 year old daughter in one at the store she seemed scrunched in.So I got the Maclaren and love it. It has the head pad for the baby and the covers for the straps. It reclines enough for my newborn to be comfortable. We love the five point harness and that the closure is a little tough to undo {since our 2 year old is very good at getting buckles undone}. The canopy is adequate for our 2 year old, but the infant{when laying all the way down} still gets sun in her face at certain times of the day. {once she is able to sit up a bit more this problem should be gone.} There is more than enough storage on this stroller. There are pockets on the back of each hood that can fit keys, cell phones, pacifers, and other smaller items. I can fit my small diaper bag and purse in the bottom of the two seats {just be careful because when the seat is laying flat you really can't access the baskets.} Our bigger diaper bags handle is wide enough to fit across the two handles and hang from there.My only complaint is no child tray. We love this feature on our Peg Perego P3 since it makes feeding the child a snack pretty easy when you are on the go. In addition the adult cup holders only fit a bottle of water or a childs bottle. In addition if you hit them the wrong way the can pop off.Overall this is an excellent stroller and we look forward to using it for sometime."
159263,1,"We have 2 daughters and have used 'bouncy seats' with both of them. We put of them in it almost from day one since you can strap them in. As time went on and they learned to move around more the toys kept them occupied and made them feel more like they were a part of the family. Depending on the personality of your child you can use this seat until they're almost a year old. (some kids after a certain age won't want to be strapped down). Some common times we've used this are: when cooking, vacuuming, taking a quick shower, and doing other activities where you need to be mobile on concentrating more on what you're doing than where your baby is. Some of our fondest memories of our kids when they were very young was when we were cooking dinner and they were in this seat on the table near us and watching them make their first attempts at talking to us by coo'ing and making spitting sounds. As an extra bonus, this comes with a vibrator which will also keep them calm(er) and help them to sleep."
91697,1,"I FIRST GOT THIS OUT FOR MY SON AT 4 WKS AND HE SEEMED DISINTERESTED. I BROUGHT IT OUT AGAIN A FEW WEEKS LATER AND HE SEEMED MUCH MORE INTERESTED. AT FIRST HE JUST STARED AT THE BIRD, THEN HE STARTED GRABBING AND KICKING AT THE HANGING TOYS. HE LAUGHS AND SMILES AND HAS LOTS OF FUN. THERE ARE TWO SMALL PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS TOY:1)IT SEEMS LIKE THE TOYS THAT HANG ON THE LOOPS EITHER HANG TOO LOW OR TOO HIGH. I HAD TO ADJUST THE TOYS TO MAKE TYHEM THE RIGHT HEIGHT. 2) AFTER A WEEK, THE BIRDS HEAD CAME OFF. IT REATTACHED EASILY, BUT IT FALLS OFF EASILY TOO."
108143,2,"If you plan to pump regularly, do not bother with this one. Spend the money for the Medella Pump in style. I hardly used my Avent pump and it cracked. It worked okay in the beginning. If you are planning to pump at work, do not rely on this one."
33944,1,"Got this for a larger fit that some of our smaller coolers. With the medela icepack (labeled as ""for breastmilk storage"" I can fit 3-4 regular playtex bottles. I can't always seal the top, but in that case I do snap the handles together and that keeps it faily well closed for the short trip to daycare. This bag has lasted 4 years for us and although we wish it was a little bigger - it seems every bigger bag too big. We love it."
167101,0,"We were debating between this seat, the Graco Saferide that goes up to 30 lbs and the Chico. This is one of the highest rated car seats for safety by consumer reports.The fabric looks more stylish than that of the majority of baby car seats available on the market, it also felt much more cushier. However, the fabric is not breathable at all, making the baby sweat, overheat, and cry!For some reason the seat also seems smaller or disproportionate to other standard baby car seats. Our 2 month old is only 23 inches and her feet will be protruding shortly! Yet she has plenty of head room.The handle is stiff and you need two hands to adjust it.The hood is flimsy and has a very unnecessary clear ""sunroof"" in the middle - you don't want sun on your baby's head and you can't see well enough through there to check how the baby is doing anyway ( might be the effect of the dark fabric). The hood is also not large enough to fully cover the seat. If you pull it all the way down you end up with a large gap in the back. On a very sunny and hot day this is a problem in the car: your baby gets the draft from the blasting air conditioner on the head - while you are trying to cover up the front from the sun! actually this a problem for cold weather in general too - not adequate coverage.we did not go with the Chico for the reason that it's hood was even smaller. The saferide was not reviewed by consumer reports and the snugride was a top seller. in retrospect we should have gone with the Saferide or another brand altogether."
39236,1,This pillow is a must have to complete the bedding. Very soft. I love the different patterns and fabric used. The velvet ruffle around the edge comes wrinkled but I was able to iron it out so it stands up better. **Make sure to lay a towel on the ruffle while ironing and use a low setting.
93230,2,I love the idea of these but they keep falling apart. I bought 6 total because my original 2 fell apart so often that I wanted to replace them but those fell apart too. My kids are no more than 30 lbs using them.
65936,1,"I normally would have not written this, however I must share my expriences with these bottles. First all they are totally AWESOME!!! They have made my life so much easier. I was having trouble with my preemie (10 weeks early) after being relaesed from the NICU. She eats are every 3 hours. I spent 1 1/2 hours trying (struggling) to feed, burp and dealing with non-stop crying. It had become such a chore I was at the verge of post pardum depression. I had tried every bottle known to MAN!! I tried Dr. Brown and reduced the expreince to 1/2 hr minus the crying and burping is a sinch. Our baby is so much happier and so am I. My loyalty is with Dr. Brown."
108804,1,"My son developed cradle cap when he was about 1 month old. I used this shampoo and the cradle cap was gone within a week! If I had to find a negative it would be that the shampoo doesn't leave hair smelling good. I mean, it doesn't have a bad odor but just doesn't leave a shampoo smell."
87226,1,"Mom just loves the Playtex Premium Nurser Gift Starter Set...she wasn't sure what method or how she was going to do this, but now this Starter Set really helps her out."
112338,1,I always used Pampers and I think it's wonderful that they are delivered to your door. It' makes a mother's life easier.
43318,1,I am so glad we purchased this stroller frame. It came in SO very handy the first 6 months when our baby was either sleeping all the time or not able to sit up well in a regular stroller. You just put the infant seat on the frame and off you go. The basket on bottom holds SO MUCH!! Perfect for shopping with baby. I also loved how light-weight the stroller is.. and my tall husband appreciated the ability to raise and lower the handle bar.
37195,1,bought this bag for my husband. strap is meant to be worn over the shoulder (messenger style). I had hard time with it on shoulder. The wipe portion didn't really keep the wipes moist though. Lots of room. My hubby loves that he has a manly diaper bag! ^_^
31187,2,"I bought this pillow after reading many recommendations from mothers of twins for the EZ to nurse pillow. But this is not the product I thought I was buying, and I found it to be almost useless. It is too soft, there was a gap between the pillow and my stomach the babies rolled into. The buckle was hard to reach and dug into my back. Even with my post pregnancy tummy I couldn't get it tight enough. The extra pillow is completely useless. The pillow I should have bought is EZ-2-Nurse Twins sold at [...], but I didn't know that at the time. I ended up using a Mybreastfriend single baby nursig pillow which was firm and more use than this."
76837,1,"I love this shade! I am the mother of 2 girls, Alice 7 and Samantha 22 months. I never had anything like this for my oldest. It makes such a difference. The little one won't go out without it! Even though I always used Sunblock on Alice, her skin is still so much darker than Samantha's; I really believe it is because of the shade. I looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and I think it is the best one on the market. The others are made from Nylon/Lycra and I don't think that would hold up as well as this one does. Thank you Protect a bub."
106213,0,i love how easy the diaper champ is to use but it smells so bad i had to move it out of babies room. it is also easy to buy bags for since it uses regular trash bags!
48722,2,"This play yard is basically low quality, and useless. Unless you are going to leave it in one spot, and never move or open it...dont buy it! You have to use a ton of force to move the joints, which makes it very difficult to set up and take down. The plastic bends and almost breaks when you try to fold or unfold it. The ""gate"" to get in is so hard to use that it is easier to just step over it. A piece of the plastic was broken when I received it, which makes me think it won't last long. I bought this to use inside and outside, but if I keep it (which I don't plan to) I would never move it because it is so hard to use. Worst joint design I have ever seen!"
79593,2,"Unstable and flimsy, this piece of plastic nonsense is such a disappointment. it's not sturdy enough to support a toddler. I should have known that at this cheap price that I was going to get junk. You're better off putting a stool on the ground and a seat on the toilet."
121129,0,"Comfy seat but when vibration turns off, our colicky kid woke up every time. Ended up buying linkadoos seat with vibration that only stopped if the batteries ran out."
31365,1,Very easy to set up. It also is very sturdy and holds a lot of stuff. I've had no problems with it.
76731,0,"They do fall off as others have said, but if you have one near by you can catch all but the first few seconds of a fountain (more if you have a quick-draw-instinct)."
10961,1,We wanted a new booster for our toddler as we started using her Fisher Price Booster seat for our younger son. The Prince Lionheart booster is great. Nice and comfortable for our little girl and really easy to clean!
184583,0,"We ordered the small bumper for our retangular marble top coffee table, and it fit well, but the longer sides still are not snug. Our 1 year old can easily pull the middle of the longer sides away from the table (it was the first thing she did!), so this doesn't protect her from hiting her head on the table.We tried to figure a ""fix"" for this problem, but the only solution was either to cut it & sew it shorter, or put the table in storage...we returned this item, not wanting to spend the time trying to make it fit by attempting to shorten it.I would reccommend this for round or oval tables only."
66989,1,My husband installed this gate and didn't have any problems. Its a very sturdy gate and it seems like it will last a long time! Its very easy to operate one handed.
156131,1,"This durable shield fits easily onto the double BOB. I was hesitant to spend the money.. there are no other options for this stroller. But now that I've seen the custom fit, I am thankful I bought it.Keeps the wind and rain off of my little ones for long walks. They are happy with the visibility they have. The only thing I'd wish for is a clear shield at the top so I could see my kids while walking. Other color options (like orange or pink) would also be nice :)"
101520,1,"I got two of this bag for my 2-year-old and 4-year-old boys. Since they are older, I don't need to carry too many things anymore. This bag is just the right size. Love it!!"
150109,0,"My daughter loves to color in the car so I got this table and it's pretty flimsy. I do understand that it is for safety issues. The other problem is it ends up slanting so far forward. It does keep her crayons on so I guess that's the main thing, but a drink won't stand on it."
36194,0,"I guess my baby never took to a sling but this sling didn't seem very secure to me. I mostly use this as a cover up now since the price is similar to other cover ups out there.The problem is that the pouch part of the sling doesn't correspond really to baby's butt so the baby is kind of hanging out in a hammock. The baby was also carrying low. I tried to tighten the sling but it was just a lot of material to force through the buckle as you tried to shorten the strap. When you take a look at the picture for the product, the widest part of the sling will wind up being on your shoulder. At least that is what happened to me.The instructions included with the sling are also not helpful. They only show a picture of the baby can be carried and that is it.If you know how to work slings, this seems like a good sling as it is well constructed and the fabric is nice. The design is also pretty. The padded shoulder part is also another plus. Otherwise those who are sling inept like me, stay away!"
174071,1,"Great swing that has a permanent spot in our family room. My son loves staring at the mobile and at himself in the convex mirror at the center of the mobile. The music is wonderful and very soothing. My only issue, as mentioned in previous reviews, is that the music and mobile only run for approximately 7 minutes. Although 7 minutes is a good length on average, I would prefer to have the option of playing the music/mobile until I explicitly turned it off. Regardless, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this swing again, it gets plenty of use in my house and runs and looks great."
66005,1,"These bottles are a God-send! I had a very low birth-weight premature infant who would hardly ever burp with the regular bottles they would use in the hospital. Which would result in a lot of air in her tiny tummy. Not good. As soon as she came home, I switched her to the Dr. Browns and from the very first feeding she was belching out loud!"
103996,1,"I highly recommend this pump. It is pricey, but it works very well and is easy to use. If you have used the Isis manual pump, assembly will be a breeze. The only difference in assembly is that you have to attach the electric pump tops instead of the white manual lever, and assemble two mechanisms instead of one. It is worth it, you can pump a lot in no time. I average an ounce a minute.The ability to control the flow is its greatest feature. I tried another electric pump and got so frustrated that it only held suction for a brief time. If you plan on long term pumping, this one is the best.I also find the Isis motor to be rather discreet, a kind of trendy addition to my son's room. I leave the pump in there and retreat to the room as it takes so little time.One drawback: Isis ought to make a connector so that you do not have to hold both pumps. It isn't a big problem, especially if you sit cross-legged and lean the bases on your legs."
47083,1,"The Baby Trend Stroller is a good option for someone with kids close in age, but if your kids are further apart a ""sit and stand"" double stroller may suit you better. The younger child sits up front and the older one gets to sit or stand in the back. My kids are 3 years apart and the Joovy Caboose Ultralight was the perfect choice for us. It's great for zoos, aquarium, parks, shopping, etc. It is moderately prices at around $230.Here are some things I took into consideration when choosing a double stroller.1) Weight: how much does the stroller weight? My wife came along to test some of these strollers and lifting most of them into an SUV or Minivan is not an easy task.2) Size: How big is it when it get folded up? If you have a sedan you can forget about trying to put anything else in your trunk after your double stroller is in it.3) Comfort\Compatibility\Scalibility: How comfortable is it for your kid? Will it suit my kids needs? Can they grow with this stroller or will they outgrow it in a year?4) Functionality: How well does it work? Is it easy to use?Here are my pro's and con's with our strollerPro's1) Looks great, many different colors to choose from. We get looks and complements from other parents saying how cool the stoller looks. Expecting moms always turn to their husbands say, honey, this is the one I want.2) Folds up much smaller and is lighter than most doubles. It is 21 lbs. The frame is made of metal and feels very solid3) The back sets gives my older son the ""big boy"" feel. He has choices as to if he wants to sit or stand. He can ride looking forwards or backwards. There's been times when I had my younger one in front with my older one and his friend standing in the back. They thought it was so cool to ride together.4) Has an infant carrier attachment you can install in the front seat. This allow you to use this stroller once #2 comes out and can last you until your younger one outgrows the front seat.5) Easy to put together and use. The stroller has a few pieces to snap in and setup is very straight forward. It is also a lot shorter and compact than most doubles6) Has some nice features. Big bucket for storage, back seat slides over buckets and keeps belonging a bit safer. Parents Neoprene organizer can we removed and washed. Big canopy that provides cover both kids.Con's1) Not too nap friendly. If the older one needs to nap, he is out of luck. He has to lean against the side rail or sit in the front seat, which he is usually too big for. If the young on up front is sleeping and you want to recline his seat it will take space away from the back seat. the older one has to sit slightly leaning forward or stand at that point.2) Catch 22, To access the storage bucket below the older child has to get up for you to access, but the child sitting on top of the door keeps belonging safe. The thief has to steal your kid before they get to your wallet. may not be a bad thing in some cases, lol.3) It doesn't ""stand"" by itself when folded. You have to lock the wheels and lean it against something, can get annoying if its raining or if you have your hands full. Wheel locks are also hard to get to when folded.4) Requires 2 hands to fold5) Gets hard to maneuver if you have the heavy kid in front and lighter kid in the back"
37022,0,"I purchased this seat after Consumer Reports recommended against using our Alpha Omega as a booster seat. The flaw that makes the Alpha Omega unsafe has been ""corrected"" in this new seat with the rounded belt guides that allow the shoulder belt to move freely. It is a good seat and I love that we were able to use the 5-point harness so long (my 5 year old is still under 40 lbs) BUT, in hindsight, I wouldn't buy it again because:1. It is huge. Once my child was old enough for a true booster, I did not want to deal with something so huge and cumbersome. It just isn't easily moved between cars for carpool, playdates, etc.2. The size also makes it nearly impossible for my son to buckle himself in.3. The new belt guide design doesn't leave slack, but the shoulder belt frequently slips out of the slot at the top of the guide.4. The tether - it's horrible. They still include the retrofit tether they've been using since the strap became mandatory - it's an afterthought and impossible to fully tighten.This seat is relatively expensive, which is easily justified if you will truly use it for as long as your child will fit in it. Unfortunately, I've found that it's just not realistic for us. I look at it like this - Would you insist on going to your primary care physician to treat cancer? No, you'd find a specialist. If you buy 3 or 4 seats - one for each stage of your child's car seat life, I think you'll be much happier. Sure, you will end up spending a little more, but it's over time."
8401,1,"The adhesive seems to be of good quality. Our, almost, 2 year old has yet to remove these from the coffee table which they are on, not to say there has been lack of trying. And they have served their purpose for a few stumbles running through the family room. I would recommend these to any other parents looking for high quality guards."
52191,0,"This stroller was OK..the steering is just horrible. I have a 6 month old and a 17 month old..I have to put the baby in the back because she can't quite sit up by herself, and the front seat doesn't recline very much, so I put my older child in the front, which makes the stroller very front heavy, and almost impossible to steer. My husband usually has to push it because it's that hard. Especially at wal-mart, where they have a very slick floor, I can;t take it in there at all. The canopy tops over the seats are nice..the cup holder for the front seat it small, and the one for the parents won't support a cup. The size is also a minus..it's just so big. I drive a camry, so it fits in the trunk, but it takes me a good 5 minutes or so to make it fit right..and I can't put anything in the trunk with it, so forget shopping! The price was right, so I thought I was getting a good deal..I've had it for 6 months and now have it for sale on craigslist, so I'm shopping for another one now that I don't need a stroller that's baby carrier compatible."
23539,1,After my son started teething he preferred soft plush toys to chew on rather than the plastic teethers. So we decided to try this one since it had both. I also decided to try this over others because it was machine washable and with two dogs and a 2 year old machine washable is great. He loves it and I am going to order two more just for the car and one for when I am washing the others. He is really soft and the plastic parts have withstood his two little teeth. I don't like the ring it comes with because of the opening but I just switched it out with the little linking rings.
93522,2,"I have a boy, and like many of the others who have wrote a review, I am very disappointed in this product. While I'm thrilled when my son tells me he has to go potty, I'm tired of cleaning up the floor after every trip to the ""royal throne"". This product was very poorly designed. Boys somehow shoot through where the top of the pan meets the bottom of the chair. There is no way Fisher Price did any ""trials"" on this product before putting it on the market. And as for the music, the batteries quickly ran out because the thing was playing music all the time, even if no one was in the room."
23957,1,"Bought this for my daughter when she was 1 month and it is really cute. It is heavy fleece so baby doesn't need more then a onesie on under this, if even that. Normally I just put my daughter in her diaper when she wears this. I then have to make sure the room stays cool or she will break a sweat. I didn't give this 5 stars because it is a thick and heavy material so my daughter can over heat easily. Otherwise I love it. She is still able to wear it now at 3 months old even though she has been out of newborn clothes for over a month now, the halo sack is still long/wide enough for her."
184568,0,"My table is the largest size in their description, yet there is still too much slack to use it safely. Baby would be able to pull the bumper far from the table & fall or hit the table. It might work fine on a round table, though."
5213,0,"It keeps falling off my baby's neck, which is a hassle once I start driving to pull over and fix. You have to make sure you tuck it in firmly into the child's neck to stay. Looks a little scary because you worry about the baby being able to breathe through it if their neck slumps down and his/her face is lying into the pillow."
184476,0,"This diaper bag looked adorable on Amazon, but when I received it I was pretty disappointed. The straps looked as though they were brown in the picture, but they turned out to be a faded black denim material. This changed the whole look of the bag for me, and I returned it. It was still a very cute bag, just not the style I was hoping for."
181030,1,"I just want to say this is quite possibly THE best purchase I have made for my son so far. We got it when he was not quite 2 months old (he's now 6 months), and he absolutely loves it! It keeps him entertained for long periods of time... sometimes I have to just go steal him back because he would stay there for hours if I let him. Great purchase!!!"
131674,2,"This is a great idea but falls short. The opening is too small (but all folding potty rings seem to be). Because the ring has to sit at the FRONT of the toilet, this leaves little room to aim and pee. I was skeptical about complaints that the front handles are in the way, but because the ring is so small, there is really no other place for little legs to go.The pluses:it folds together easily so the dirty sides all fold into each otherit's really compact when it foldsthe joints have plastic grooves that 'click' together when they're fully extendedthe bumpers at the bottom of this are FABULOUS. they have a lot of grip and really keep the ring in placeThe minuses:the plastic is really flimsy and any kid over 20lbs (maybe less) will flex thisbecause it has to sit at the front of the toilet, there is minimal support at the back and the flexing is accentuatedbecause it has to sit at the front of the toilet, expect the best aim to go right past the potty ring and onto the nasty public toilet bowl and kid's clothesThe mellow go-with-the-flow kid that got to sit on this IMMEDIATELY asked to go to a different potty and then said DONE just to get off the thing.There aren't much better choices, but considerMommy's Helper Cushie Travelerif you need something compact."
38943,1,Very nice and soft for my grand daughter. I love that it hangs and dries very easy. I recommend this to any new mom.
134052,2,"I received this item as a shower gift. I used it for a couple days when the latch on the pop-up lid feature would not catch. I had my husband return the item and get a replacement. The latch on the second one would not work either. There appears to be some type of design flaw. The other reviewers are correct that when you open the entire lid, the condensation from the moisture leaks out of the warmer. While this is a good concept, the design needs work. Also, my baby does not seem to mind cold wipes. I think she has become accustomed to them since that's what we have primarily used. I will probably return the second one also since it won't work properly and get something more useful."
95916,1,My son loves this jumper! He is 7 months old. It's the 3rd one we've tried. We tried the one you hang from a door jamb and the one on a frame... but this one offers more support and more toys to keep him occupied than any other jumper. He jumps as high as he can and it doesn't budge. It's designed well and it's very safe. We will use it with every child we have.
87604,0,"It's adorable, durable, and it squeaks. It's also smaller than an adult hand, so just don't be expecting anything grand."
42987,1,"Ordered this for my neice; I trade off with her mommy & another co-worker helping feed & change her etc. Her mommy says it's much more comfortable than the Bjorn! I chose it specifically because it fits all 3 of us & because we all have chronic back pain. I was very pleased with how evenly it distributes her weight without putting pressure on any one area. (she weighs about 13 pounds) I would recommend this to anyone concerned about a baby carrier aggravating their back/back pain. I have injured/repaired discs in my lower back & wearing the Moby doesn't hurt at all!The only issues we've had is she doesn't like to be in it when we're sitting down (we wear her facing out) but I've read similar comments on parenting website message boards so I doubt it has anything to do with the wrap itself. The other is she's like a little heater! 2 of us notice that we get quite warm while wearing her; but that's pretty minor & again nothing to do with the wrap. Fantastic product, innovative yet so simple you wonder why someone didn't market it ages ago."
134359,2,The reviews for this item were great ... however ... we had browning at the bottom of the wipes and the lid broke after 2 months of use. The wipes do not keep warm ... cool rather quickly. We have given up for fear of overheating.
34540,1,"I purchased this pail over a year ago, and it's still going strong. I initially put all diapers (#1 and #2's) when my child was an infant but found the pail didn't hold the stink in very well, even before my child began solid foods. Now, I place only #1 diapers in it and have no problems with odor leakage unless the lid is left open. I do clean it once in a while (no more than 1x/month) with disinfectant and hot water, and this helps cut down on the smell when I open the lid to change the bags. The reason I purchased this over more expensive pails is I can use regular trash bags or recycled store bags. I use recycled store bags, which gives me enough room to fit two days worth of diapers and is just the right time to leave the diapers in there without having odor leakage. Also, the odor disks are useless, so I removed the plastic disc holder from the lid so I could fit more diapers in the pail.PROS:- Inexpensive- No need for expensive refills or odor disks- Just the ride size to hide in the corner of the room- Attractive color- Can store extra bags in bottom of pail for easy refill- Easy to openCONS:- Noisy when smaller lid opens- Prone to odor leakage- Odor disks are uselessOverall, I've been pleased with this pail and would recommend it over more expensive pails. It does have drawbacks, but after trial and error, I've found ways around the most annoying ones. Highly recommend!"
157322,1,"This is absolutely beautiful. I was a little worried that it may not have been as study as it looked due to all the mediocre reviews, but this thing is rock solid and my daughter loves it for her new baby! Well made and will last a long time."
55077,2,the product was not as pictured it was all apart in the boxthere was no bear or a stuffed animal they might have put the wru\ong order in the box but supposly the refunded my money I need to wait to see the bill
36817,1,"I got the boppy for breast feeding. A lot of mothers told me it was really helpful and while I can see that it would be I only used it once or twice while nursing. It was just a pain in the butt to be carrying another thing around during those first few weeks. That is just me though. I can see people loving this for nursing. However, if you are like me, don't despair if you have a boppy and are not using it. Don't throw it in a closet quite yet. There are SO MANY uses for this thing. I used it for a pillow several times and as an aid to prop baby up next to me when they had gas. Several of my friends used it for tummy time. These are all nice uses but I knew I had hit gold with this thing when it was time for baby to sit up on their own. My son would sit up very well but every now and then he would fall backwards. I placed this behind him and I never had to worry about him hitting his head. I could sit him up and drink some water, play with him and his toys, all the while not worrying about him falling all about.You may not 'need' this, but it is a nice thing to have and and use for all sorts of purposes. It can be another set of hands. On your baby registry is a perfect way to get this pillow with out feeling guilty for dropping coin on something you may or may not use."
123009,1,I'm so glad I ordered this! It helps me keep organized and keeps my fridge a bit tidier. Its really great for those that exclusively pump. The bottles work with my Medela pump and the price is great. Very pleased with this purchase.
93415,1,"Where to begin? I scoured the internet for the best umbrella stroller for my money, one with the best features without breaking my bank. I found it in the Chicco C5. I am a 5'8"" woman, my husband is 6'3"", and I had previously not been able to find an umbrella-type stroller that was comfortable to push. This one has HIGH handles; I love it! It is also easy to steer one-handed. The seat reclines almost to a full recline; the recline level is up to you due to the sliding adjustment tether. The leg rest is a nice added feature. All four wheels can lock; good for when my youngest son's older brothers try to take him for a ride. The mechanism to lock the stroller in the open position is great; it has a pedal, no pinched feet! The basket underneath is fine; large enough to hold my purse and some diaper items. It is hard to get into the basket with the seat fully reclined, but I solved that by adjusting where the strap that holds the top of the basket is placed. It snaps around the side legs just above one of the joints for the folding arms; I simply unsnapped the strap and resnapped it underneath the joints. The stroller still folds fine. The canopy comes with a removable back cover which has a pocket to store things, something I wasn't aware of when I purchased the stroller but am pleased with. The whole stroller took less than five minutes to assemble, and I didn't need to open the instructions. My only ""complaint"" is that the canopy doesn't rotate fully, something my Quattro Tour's canopy did; but I knew this when I bought it and am still very happy I spent the money on this stroller."
140854,1,"I love this pump. I am working full time and am pumping 3 times a day. The case is very discrete (many people think it is my computer case), and I can store my expressed milk in the refrigerated case all day (and not use the work refrigerator). Everything is very organized and kept clean. There is extra room to store bottle parts, a photo albun, and even a drink! The pump itself is very comfortable and quiet. I also like that the milk cannot get back up into the tubing.My baby likes the playtex bottle system (with the wide base natural latch nipples) and has no problem switching from bottle to breast. This pump is compatible with all the bottles and liners from playtex which makes things very convenient for easy pumping and storing. I also love the one step system to freeze milk. It connects right to the pump and doesn't leak at all when put in the freezer and thawed later.I cannot say enough good things about this pump, and for a first time mother who works full time, I could not have chosen a better pump.Two thumbs way up!!!"
157777,1,My baby was suffering from acid reflux when I bought this in a panic. She started to roll onto her side at 3 weeks and had been sleeping like that ever since but I wanted to put her on her tummy to sleep sometimes so she wouldn't feel like she was drowning all the time. I was terrified that she would die from SIDS or suffocate. I'm sort of a paranoid type A person so I realize that she would probably be fine but didn't want to take my chances. The monitor works perfectly. The only thing I don't like is how loud the ticking is in her room but I don't mind hearing it all night. I sleep better with it because I'm not worried about her. We have had no false alarms but it did go off one night. She was breathing when I made it to her room but you could tell she hadn't been. I also have a video monitor on her so I can see her and lately she's been moving around in her crib and it still picks her up just fine. I would buy this again without a doubt. I just wish I had known about it sooner.
95429,1,"My son is a stuffed animalaholic. He has so many I had to buy this net, and we counted he's got 42 stuffed animals in this netting, and 4 of them are huge! (Taller than my 2' son). I highly recommend this item if you're tired of looking at stuffed animals everywhere. I'm about to purchase another one, because he has since found more! lol"
9790,1,"This product replaced our old chair which came apart to be cleaned and somehow always had urine seeping to places besides the bowl. The Baby Bjorn only has one removable piece, and everything is always in the bowl. I love how simplistic it is. The sizable ""horn"" on the front of the bowl keeps the firing zone covered for little boys which is a major bonus.My son is on medication which causes difficulty going. I decided that he may have success (and better health) if he were able to sit on a potty and relax. My concern before I ordered the chair was that it would not fit him properly since he is only 14 months old. Needless to say, we now are proud owners of a Baby Bjorn potty, and my baby puts a proud ""poo poo"" in it every day. The design is perfect for any little person to straddle, and their feet can rest on the floor so that they are confident and not afraid to fall off. This also gives them leverage for a ""good push""."
26672,1,This gate is the best that can be purchased for use with a new puppy. Great product and does a very good job when used corrrectly. This is a very good product and it is sold at a very good price.
25374,1,These locks are perfect for our entire house! My 17 month old cannot open the doors even a smidge and I love the adhesive to avoid screwing holes into my new cabinets.
16321,1,"Initially we bought this blanket to use with our four month old grandchild at the beach. But since she mainly stays in her Kidco PeaPod, the rest of us also use it. Here is what I like:1. Fully opened the blanket is 5' x 5', which is adequate for an adult to sit on at the beach, and more than adequate for an infant or small child. It is also just the right size on which to put an assortment of items that you want to keep off the sand (like a camera case, Kindle, towels, etc.).2. The blanket is nicely padded and very comfortable to sit or lay down on. It is also moisture resistant on the bottom, so if the sand at the beach (or grass at a park) is damp, you won't feel it.3. This has creases in it that serve as guide to folding it up, which takes literally seconds, even on a very windy day at the beach. And unlike thinner blankets, the wind does not lift this one up as easily.4. This is very lightweight to carry and takes up very little space when you are packing the car.Bottom line: This is a nice product for both young and old. I recommend it.Update June 28, 2011: When fully closed, this works well as a knee pad. It was very comfortable to kneel on as I put air into two bicycles in my driveway.Update July 13, 2011: On a recent vacation I went to a concert in the park right after a rainstorm. The park bench near the stage was still wet, so I just opened this lenghth wise without unfolding the width and draped it over the back and seat of the bench. Now I had a nice dry spot to sit.I also used this as a knee pad when I had to attach some straps on a bike rack to the underside of my car. It has become one of those items that I now bring with me on any trip because I keep finding new uses for it."
138877,1,"I bought this for my five year old niece, and it was perfect. It wasn't too complicated, and the timer is a great feature. I have to buy another one for my nephew's room because they fight over it. My only criticism is that it's nearly impossible to place it as close to the ceiling (in the center of the room?) as they direct.You shouldn't expect that the constellations are very astronomically correct, but if you just want stars on the ceiling, this is great. I wouldn't mind having one myself. :)"
182674,1,I like this product because my son can feel when he is wet. It helps him remember to go on the potty.
96642,1,"This is a staple now in our nursery. Baby LOVED this... I put it on while I am nursing him, and by the time he is done, he is sooooo sleepy! I leave it on for the 45 minute timer, and he has been sleeping through the night ever since!"
114104,1,"This seat is awsome, it's durable since I purchased and have been using it flawlessly for over 1 year. It's easy to pack a carry for travel, and is also lightweight. It attaches to virtually all kinds of chairs. My daughter is not 2 years old and the seat is getting small for her, but I think it should still last for another year or so."
48306,2,"The picture is great if you want to sit and stare at the monitor like you would dial a phone. You must be very close to see what's going on. Lots of Interference. But when you get good reception, the audio is incredibly clear! A little color during the times of bright daylight. The video portion broke on the fourth day. Will return and exchange for another brand!!! If it seems a little too good to be true... It is!"
52393,0,"I love the concept of this bag and based on other reviews I went ahead and ordered it. I have a 17 month-old and we aren't carrying as much stuff with us anymore so I thought it would be perfect. I gave the bag 3 stars because for its size it has a wonderful amount of storage space and it looks great! Another reviewer mentioned something to the effect of how you didn't have to worry about smacking your toddler in the face with this diaper bag, which agreeably is a WONDERFUL feature as that is one of my peeves. (Managing purse & diaper bag on shoulder while picking up baby.) However, and maybe I was doing something wrong, but, everytime I bent over with this bag fully packed, the weight of it would swing it down under my right arm so it was still a problem trying to manage it and pick up my toddler. And this was with the adjustment strap fully tightened. I am 5'3"", so maybe a taller user could get it tighter than I was able to. Also, the bottle bag that comes with it is truly that,a BOTTLE bag. It would not hold any of the sippy cups I have, and I have many different types from the cheap to not so cheap. I ended up returning it, although I think this would be a nice bag for airline travel, just not an every day bag for us. Hope this helps someone! :o)"
58940,1,"This sterilizer is so easy to use. It has three adjustable racks for bottles, nipples or other items. You just put water in the bottom, your bottles (rinsed with warm, soapy water) in the racks, put on the lid and press the button to start it. It is done sterilizing within ten minutes. You have to clean it every so often by running it with citric acid (or vinegar) in there and since it has a coil heater, it should be unplugged when not it use. Basically, it requires very little maintenance when the alternative is boiling bottles on the stove which takes longer and your bottles may easily be ruined. The bottles are usually still a bit wet when the sterilization cycle is done, but you can leave them in there to dry, or place them on paper towels (putting a paper towel over the top of the bottles helps keep them sterile). The sterilizer also comes with little plastic tongs to grab things and keep them sterile, but I just use my clean hands and my baby has not had a problem. I sterilize Avent and Medela products in it and I have been very happy with the effectiveness and ease of this sterilizer."

12906,2,I'd give this a 0 stars but that is not an option. I am 28 days away from my due date and I have yet to hear the heartbeat via this device. My husband and I bought it and tried it. It didn't work. We'd turn it low and then high and still no heartbeat! The worst part is that it is considered a health and beauty product and can't be returned to the store. Don't take the risk... you'll regret it!
25481,0,"I have been trying to find a liner that doesn't bunch too badly, fits the Bum Genius 3.0 one size diaper well and doesn't irritate my child's skin. These only fit one of these requirements (the last one). The bunch pretty badly on my active 16 month old and have to be folded or cut to fit the diapers we use. This last detail seems to be an issue with all of the liners I have tried except the Kushies. All of the liners I have tried seem to bunch too so this may be a lost cause. It is curious to me why the manufacturers make liners that do not seem to fit the diapers and don't offer details on how they see them being used. Maybe someday..."
44170,0,"I think this is a very good concept, but it did not fit well. As a result, it kept popping off."
184849,2,"El carro es muy bueno para ir rapido derecho, pero para doblar es una tortura porque la rueda es fija y no dobla. Ademas la parte donde esta el bebe es super dura, sin acolchado.. Ademas sirve para bebes de mas de 7 meses porque bebes mas chicquitos es medio inseguro a mi entender."
117711,0,"This unit is very sturdy and well-made. I like the bumper tray as it protects my door frames and prevents my son from hitting his head. My son loves jumping and swaying in the bumper jumper, but the only problem is that the height adjuster strap is too long and my son who is only 4 and a half months old is almost too tall for it. My little guy is very big for his age, but the jumper is only at the right position at the highest setting, and I just got it a few weeks ago! I guess I hoped to get more use out of it, but for now it is a great product and would be highly recommended for small to average size babies."
6280,2,"I first purchased the 2.4GHZ last June. It lasted three months and was completely out without warning. The company is very cooperative and asks no questions. You have the choice to have them send a new monitor or a complete refund. Second monitor, went out in about 3 1/2 months and sent this one back. I purchased the third one on January 7 and it is now out. The company has pulled these off of the shelf because they were no good and replaced them with this model. I drove to the nearest toys r us today which is 40 miles and this is a horrible model. Their is barely a picture of the baby. This one will now be returned. I rate this very poorly, although keep in mind the company is awesome and will never give you any problems with returns or refunds."
70313,2,"Got back online to research getting a new gate. Then saw the gate we just installed, decided to let others know, it is very ineffecient. It is hard to get it to lock and unlock, its wobbly, and the babies I have 2 can open it quicker than I can."
132394,1,"We purchased this wipe warmer after reading previous reviews, both on Amazon and on the web, for our first child. So far, it has worked beautifully - no browning, and the temp is wonderful for our daughter, who was very sensitive to the cold wetness of wipes before we used it. It doesn't make her little body jump in shock every time we have a diaper change, which has been wonderful! Very affordable, and the nightlight feature is a great addition as well."
21528,2,"I wish I could send this thing back, but I threw the box away and have kept it too long, trying to get it to work out, but now I'm done w/it. I can't get the bottom bar to stay secure. The gate is good in theory, but I have an active and curious baby, and he's always trying to go underneath it because the lower bar won't stay put. I feel like I wasted the $30 I spent on this gate."
103375,2,"We bought this gate three years ago when our first daughter was born. We didn't use it until she was crawling and moving around, so the gate has gotten about 2 1/2 years of steady, solid use. Originally, we found it very loud when it closed (we'd get her to sleep only to have her wake up when the gate closed behind us). We learned to close it quietly. About a month ago, however (we now have a second child who's just started crawling), the knob froze in the same way that others report. At first, it just locked in place, but we could manually turn the knob to make it lock, then the knob just stopped turning at all. (and with the height of this gate, it's difficult to climb over it and I won't do it while holding my younger daughter!)."
56742,1,"I had been looking for a very simple, reasonably priced Moses basket and finally came across this one. Even if I hadn't snatched it up when it was on sale (almost half the price!) it's still much cheaper than most Moses baskets I've seen. Since I've still got a couple of months left before the baby comes, I can't attest to how she'll like it. However the basket itself is very nice. I ended up taking out the liner because it just didn't seem very safe (and white ruffles aren't really my style anyway), and the sheet doesn't fit as tightly as I'd like (but I can fix that with a little bit of sewing). I love that it comes with the different color ribbons so I can change it out in the future if we ever have a boy, or if I just get sick of pink. Even though I'm not going to use the liner, I just wove the ribbon it into the basket itself and it looks very simple and sweet.As for the handles. They do fall slightly inward, but not really into the basket itself (they just sort of hover above it), so I'm not worried.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I can't wait for my baby girl to get here so she can try it out (and so I can get some much anticipated baby cuddles)!"
178977,1,"I'll start by saying that liner-based bottles are a thing of the past. I'm not sure why anyone would still consider them. So, thats a positive for this product already.This set works as well as the other mainstream brands. I think these leaked significantly less than comparable models. And by leaking, I mean the leaking caused by milk being in the grooves of the lid when you screw the lid on. That gap is the killer from which many a mess has been made.Grade; 4stars"
45150,1,"After reading reviews I decided to register for this playmat and have not regretted it for one moment. My daughter (currently 8 weeks old) loves it and she's discovering new parts of the playmat all the time. I'm sure that this playmat will keep her entertained for a long time yet as it has many features which she has still to explore. The brightly colored toys, the music and the flashing lights make it fun for us to play with her on this mat (I happen to think this is also important). We enjoy shaking the frame making all the toys jiggle."
45991,0,"Although the images on this mobile are incredibly stimulating and great for infants' development, the actual construction of this mobile leaves a lot to be desired. For one, it is very difficult to get the cards onto the little plastic knobs that hold them in place and once they're there, they're pretty much there for life. We found that when we were ready to take down the black/white images and put on the more ""advanced"" colored images that when you tried to pry the cards off you either ended up ripping them off b/c you had to pull so hard or you hurt a finger. Plus, the way that some of the cards have their holes punched they can only ever hang in one direction, for instance one card w/zig zags has a hole that only allows it to be hung vertically so it could never hang horizontally and face the baby like some of the others. Not sure why this is the case. Maybe they're thinking the baby would see it from another angle??In all, I love the idea of this mobile but I found it to be much more limited in function than it seems. Definitely more stimulating and attractive than most out there but be careful about how you put the image cards up b/c they could be stuck that way forever. Plus the gigantic plastic arm is not exactly great to look at so my husband ended up hanging ours over the crib using fishing line and kind of rigging it to the curtain rod nearby..."
62920,1,"I've recommened it to so many people. I just love it. It blocks the smell really well & I have no problems emtying it when it needs (my husband on the other hand, has problems getting the 'cuter' to work). My daughter is 9 months & eating a lot of real food & I still don't smell poop."
14928,2,"My daughter hates the Avent nipple, she is breastfed and can't seem to suck on these nipples, even though she does fine with regular nipples. I find that ironic since they market these as easy to transition from breast to bottle. The wide neck makes it harder for me to keep air out of the nipple. These bottles are large and they don't fit any other nipples or rings. They don't fit well in my dishwasher baskets either. They are just plain cumbersome, and overpriced."
137253,1,I purchased this for my 6 month old who has a difficult time being on his tummy and lifting his head.This is perfect. He lasts on the tummy pillow twice as long as he would on the bed or the sofa. He's even started to move his knees up to crawl while on the pillow.The mat is a lot larger than I thought. It's perfect and it's definitely worth the money.
22874,1,Great sling! 100% worth the money. I like the design and versatility of it. My son goes right to sleep in it. i would definitely recommend this product :)
122468,1,"Used them along with a solar system kit for a project with my nieces and nephew. It was quite entertaining and kept the kids interested. There's a ton of stars in this kit, and just needed two to get my entire living room. Looks quite beautiful in the evening, with a small black light."
75177,0,"These helped get my kids used to taking their own diaper on and off, which helps with potty training. My main complain is how easily they come apart and how hard they are to get back together. Taking them apart is necessary to change #2's, but you don't need to put them together again after that."
49493,1,"Does a good jobs limited dogs or children from accessing certain areas. It is sturdy to an extent. If your child or dogs (weighing more than 60 lbs) pull or jump on it, it will wobble. Was well worth the price but advise buying the additional section for a larger enclosed area."
132319,1,"I haven't had a chance to hang these up yet, but I'll assume they'll look just as cute as the picture. All coordinates to the bedding seemed reasonably priced. So I bought everything that matched. Before getting on Amazon, I couldn't find any nursery stuff with dragonflies on it."
116882,1,"I really love this product, unlike the lotion this neutral smell is something I welcome. I've had this baby powder forever and I use it quite regularly. I am looking forward to using what I have so I can order more.I recommend this to anyone who wants to fresh but doesn't necessarily want to smell like a baby. It also works well in the summer as a bumper for your deodorant."
106285,2,"We bought this thinking we were getting a great deal, an easy to use odorless pail that uses regular trash bags. WRONG! Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast. It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless. Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage."
169382,1,Very pleased with this product. Did notice an odor when I first opened it but I washed everything and was pleased with how soft the comforter and sheet set was. The bumper pad fits nicely in my daughter's crib and the bedskirt is adorable. Would recommend this to anyone
107593,2,"Received these as a baby shower gift 3 months before our daughter was born. Put them in a box with other car items for the baby awaiting her birth. After shw was born we opened them up and 1 of the suction cups for each was misshapen and unusable straight out of the package. Tried using the 2 ""good"" suction cups to hang one and nothing. They won't stick no matter what you do (i.e. clean window, clean cup, use alcohol on window, etc.). Thought it was because it was winter and the cups where made out of plastic so got hard in the cold weather. Tried again now that the temp has gotten better but still no luck. Wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
47103,1,"I've had this stroller just over one month. I have an 18 month old and a 3 !/2 year old. My 6 year old even fits in the back when he rides occasionally. My 3 1/2 year old is very big for her age (95% height & weight), but she fits perfectly. It's easy to maneuver and lightweight enough to easily get in and out of my minivan.I bought this for some upcoming trips this summer, figuring if my older children get tired, they could sit for awhile and we wouldn't have to rent theme park strollers. We've been using it since it arrived to get used to it & I can't say enough good things about it. I love the fun color options, hard to pick just one."
25536,1,"I've been using these for almost 12 months in my son's cloth diapers. They do not tear apart with moisture and collect most of the solids for easier diaper cleanup. Now that my son wears 18m clothing and is more active, the liners do not fit as well in his diapers and more solids leak out the sides and front. They feel stiff to the touch, but my son does not seem to mind or develop irritation. Unless washed with Velcro, these liners also seem to withstand rewashing for those who may want to purchase fewer liners."
149288,1,"I am very tall, 5'11 so this pillow did not work very good in the recomended position (legs wrapped around pillow end) because the ends weren't long enough. If someone would make one with longer ends I would be grateful! Anyway, I would lay the pillow down and push the ends together to create a cushioned pocket for my hip. It worked so great for that! Also, hospital beds are so hard.. I would have died without it. Your hips will really start to ache in the later months of pregnancy but this really helps!!"
4828,1,"Chlorine & perfume free & environmentally friendly, the closest thing to a cloth diaper without the hassle you can get! They are incredibly soft and work just as well if not better as the leading brands!"
34733,0,"I had just installed my alpha omega elite, It seemed difficult at first with all the straps and than I realized that my Ford Explorer dose not have anywhere to clip the straps to, so I used my car seat belt threw the back of the car seat, and it seems to be in very tight. I do plan on having it checked by someone. One of the things I am unhappy with is the Plush infant insert dose not come off of my car seat, it is stiched in, and when I put the pillow over it, it is way to bulkey to rest his head. I wonder if they are all like that? Plus the carseat dose not recline once it is installed. I guess I like the car seat otherwise. If it is in correctly. I do plan on having it checked out before I put my son in it.(I will hold on to the box and recipt just in case!)It dose seem like a lot of trouble for the money I paid for it."
161393,0,"I bought this tub when my daughter was born in June 2000. I didn't like the fact that because you could close it up the space in the middle leaked which meant you had to bathe her quickly, that got aggravating. I didn't use it for very long."
40668,2,"I have had a terrible experience with Pamper's Cruisers. My daughter is 14 months old and has only had one serious rash (a result of strong antibiotics). I had never used pamper's cruisers until last week. I had a coupon and thought I would give it a try. In less than a week my daughter broke out in the worse rash I had ever seen! There were open blisters and nothing I tried seemed to provide her any relief. My Aunt happened to see a story on the news about the diapers so I switched back to my generic brand (Target diapers are great, by the way) and within 48 hours her rash was almost completely cleared up. I am convinced it was the diapers that caused the reaction."
6713,1,"These diapers are great and the price is great compared to the stores. With Huggies we had a tough time with the leaks, but fortunately, Pampers saved the day. Highly recommend Pampers for new parents."
92914,1,"My daughter (2 1/2 yrs old) likes this cot, a lot.I bought it for her so that she could nap on it while my M-I-L is over watching her since she has a hard time with stairs and lifting toddler into high crib.She sleeps on it for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours in the afternoon, which is about 1 hour shorter than if she were to nap in her crib inside her (darkened) room.It suits this purpose well and I intend on taking it on overnight weekend trips so we don't have to haul her port-a-crib.The only disadvantage is that she can get out of it, of course, but... it's a cot!She began daycare recently and sleeps on their cots for the same amount of time, so I figured I'd buy it for my M-I-L at home. It does the trick and my baby thinks it's special. I tell her that it's only for when Grandma S is over (b/c she wanted to start sleeping/napping in it all the time).Naturally, I'd prefer she take a longer nap, so I told her it's for special days only, when Grandma S is here. So now she uses it to ""tuck in"" her bunny-bear stuffed animal before she goes to her room at night.I love it, and it seems comfortable, very portable and handy. I would recommend it.The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is that I have yet to use it on a weekend trip, but I wanted to review it now, in case you were wondering whether or not to get it. I think it's very much worth it, but everyone's different. It's relatively small and inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it for their stuffed animal friends.Also, it is very sturdy & supportive and opens and collapses with no trouble at all.Hope that helps!"
127280,1,"I purchased this for my grandaughter's visits. Crib was easy to put together, if you are careful it doesn't scratch. Looks beautiful in the room, is very sturdy and my grandaughter sleeps great in it. I like that the highest crib placement is very high and makes it very easy to put a sleeping child to bed in without waking her. I would definately recommend this crib."
21714,1,"This is the cutest theme. My 2 month old son loves looking at the animals, he just stares at them. The bedding is good quality and I love everything about the entire set!!"
45804,1,"Ok, I couldn't resist that title! :) This product works great. One recomendation. Go to costco or other big box warehouse store and buy a gajillion 10 gallon plastic bags. Line it with one before using. Then close the bag and place it in a 2nd bag (insurance policy). Drop it in a trash barrel at your convenience."
132255,2,The lamp shade is nice and goes great with the rest of the set. Came perfectly packaged!Never have been able to find a base that it fits on... So while it looks nice if you don't have a lamp to go with it what is the point!?
71540,0,"I love the look of this stroller. I admit, its beautiful. With my baby I wanted a stroller that had a bassinet. WHOA, but some of the criticisms about the Bugaboos ARE warranted. Yes, once you figure out how to put the stroller together and use it, it's a bit easier, but it IS bulky and takes up a LOT of space. The only thing I'm not sure about is if ALL strollers are bulky and take up a lot of space (besides the umbrella strollers). I have to say, we were on vacation and I had to buy a inexpensive ""umbrella"" stroller from Target and I LOVED it so much more than my Frog. (I really hate to say that). But it was sooooooooooooooo easy to get around and maneuvered very well. I thought, wow, spent $800 on my Frog and like my $20 stroller better. :(I also admit, I didn't read ALL the instructions and got stuck a few times trying to figure out how to detach the Frog. Goodness, it was FRUSTRATING!!!! Especially if you have a tired crying infant in the summer heat. NOT FUN.If you buy this stroller, PLEASE WATCH THE CD/DVD and MAKE SURE you READ the instructions CAREFULLY so you know how to use the stroller. It is TOO EXPENSIVE if you end up not knowing how to use the stroller."
122788,2,"This medicine dispenser itself is a great idea. My daughter has no issues with sucking down the medicine with this pacifier.. However, what is up with it being so hard to open and close?? They need to sort this flaw out. The last thing I want to be dealing with is a screaming child in one arm, and wresting with a medicine dispenser open close function with the other hand."
97289,1,My son absolutely loved this my husband has to go out of town for his job sometimes so when I take a shower I just put him it in in the bathtub and he loved it
10733,1,"This drying rack is wonderful! My baby would not nurse so he is strictly bottle-fed, so we always have a lot of bottles to wash!This rack holds all the bottles, nipples, caps and the nipple rings! I have small bottles, big bottles, fat bottles and skinny bottles this rack holds them all!If you have a lot of bottles to wash all the time (even good for sippy cups!), I totally recommend this rack."
47279,1,"I wish that someone would have had a review for the two strollers before I went out & bought both to make my own. LOLMia Moda: 35lbs. Have had stroller for several weeks now. I used it with my 2 1/2yr old & 4mo old, so I used the car seat adapter.Pros:*Stands when folded*Rear seat slides toward adult which makes it easier for rear child to sit when front seat is reclined with the car seat.Cons:*REALLY hard to fold & unfold!!! I really hate it!*Basket is way too small and has a bar running across it. I cannot fit my TINY jeep backpack diaper bag in it.*Cupholder space for adult cannot be used at all when the handle is in the highest position. Being 5'9"", that makes the cupholder feature worthless for me. Even WITH the handle in highest position, I am still leaning down a little to push the stroller.*Canopy is hard to push forward when closing the stroller. The online video makes it look so easy; it's not. It clicks hard & I fear I am going to break the thing. Canopy only covers front child.*Stroller breaks must be in lock position to fold up the stroller.*When inserting the stroller into the car from the folded position, I feel like I am manhandling it. It is hard to find a hand grip near the tires as they obviously didnt take that into consideration. DO NOT grab it by the foot rest, it will just pop right off.Joovy Ultralight 2010: I bought it in ""orangie"" because it looked like a nice light orange. IT IS NOT. It is NEON orange in person & I feel like I have a ""Halloween"" Stroller. It would cost me too much to ship it back for an exchange, so I am hoping the color grows on me over time.Pros:*21lbs vs 34.*Taller. I do not have to lean down nearly as far & I feel that it is easier to steer and manuver.*Canopy is big enough for both children.*Basket can hold my diaper bag.Cons:*The back seat slides & there is nothing to stop it from going forward or backward. On the Mia Moda, it ""clicked"" into place on the side bars firmly & wouldn't budge.*When folded into closed position, you must hold it or it will fall over.I wanted to torch my Mia Moda. It was an awful experience. I can honestly say that I prefer the Joovy. And in 12mo I have owned my fair share of strollers trying to find the right one for me (Graco quattro tour duo, mia moda, & now joovy).Other than the color, I LOVE my joovy. Anyone want to trade? LOL, JK."
158448,1,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves them. It helps her to eat by herself and that is all she wants to do. Also, she likes to feed her baby dolls with them. Perfect size."
16671,2,"As a mom of four, I have plenty of experience with sippy cups. Seeing this one in the store, I thought that the handles were nice and chunky for little hands to grip and the straw was just right for a little one's first experience with straws. Having used it for months now, I think the design is good, the execution is poor - this thing seems to create mold from thin air. I only use two sippy cups with my 1 year old, so I am washing both of them on a daily basis...DAILY, not a few days go by and I find it all gross and have to spend extra time cleaning it. I mean that if anything other than water is in this cup for more than 12 hours, there will be mold in the straw, the lid, the cup and everywhere in-between. I have never seen anything like it. So if you just want to use it for water, then it is probably a great cup. If you want it for juice or milk, find something else."
157028,1,"Our baby loved this thing! He was teething while he was using it and one of his favorite things to do was pull the mirror thing (with the spikes)down and gnaw on it but it never hurt him. Although it is kind of hard to do it by oneself, you can fold this thing down to almost flat, which is great because you can shove it under the bed or in the linen closet when the baby isn't using it (and it's not often). Our baby found the toy very entertaining, the king and queen thing does have to get smacked pretty hard but once he discovered it played music, it never stopped. Even when he wasn't in the saucer he'd go up and play with the toys on it. It's so cool watching them figure them out!"
120695,1,"We're using disposable diapers but bought some of these on friends' suggestions to use as burp cloths. They are flannel-like and get even softer with washing. They hold up very well, so once the baby's no longer using them, I think they'll come in handy for dusting etc around the house. I thought after I had bought them that I might have purchased the wrong ones since I bought pre-folded (rather than flat) but didn't need them to use as diapers. As it turns out, the pre-folded ones are divided into thirds with the inner third being a double layer, just the way that fancy burp cloths are. The bottom line: if you need burp cloths (and you definitely will), these are a great buy and at least as good in quality as any others I've seen that are marketed for that purpose. Buy two or three packs."
76493,2,"This was a perfect design for our baby when he was a couple of weeks old, but then, as he began to fidget and wiggle, he slid right off of the wedge."
119328,1,"absolutely amazing, completely worth the money! it is sooooo much more comfortable and very easy to use, i definitely recommend this product!"
144182,1,"My 2-month-old loves these NUK pacifiers. I had a couple of transparent ones for her before this, and they were hard to find because they disappear into crib sheets etc. (seriously). So the colors are a nice change."
26949,0,"I bought this a few days ago as I have been getting an aching pain in my groin and my doctor recommended I get a support belt. I read many reviews and this seemed to be the best product for the least amount of money. However I read on most posts that the sizing was wrong and that most women wished they had got the next size up. So following this I thought I would be smart and get the next size up which is the Medium. I am just over 6 months pregnant, 5 foot 6 and weight about 135 lbs. The medium on the smallest notch is pretty much too big. It allows some support but not enough for what I was needing it for. I know in a month or so it will be better but I wish I had got the small and it would have been tighter which would have allowed for greater support for me now. I am going to keep this one as it's too much hassle to send it back and just hope that it becomes useful for me."
133831,1,"juts like it look in the picture, is the size i needed and it look beautiful in my son bedroom"
63008,1,"Being a petite lady (4' 11""), I was worried that the larger size would be too much pillow so I tried this size first. Its great! I have enough space to be comfortable but still have room for my pillow. I toss and turn at night and this pillow can move with me. I don't feel that my husband is on the other side of my pillow mountain. Also great to roll up to put under my knees to rest after yoga!UPDATE: Since having my baby I have found it to be just as useful! When I was nursing I found this pillow to be much better then the boppy pillow since I could wrap the pillow to support my back and neck. We also put the baby in the middle of the pillow to keep him safe on the sofa and bed."
95318,1,"I was in need of a third monitor for my home. I have tried many monitors and nothing would work since I already have 2 monitors in use. I was told that I was very lucky to have 2 working, and that I would not be able to have 3 monitors in use at the same time. I decided to try the Sounds N Lights Monitor and so far it's awesome! I have very little static, but it's very minimal compared to the others I have tried. I'm very pleased to have found this monitor because now I can sleep easier being able to hear all 3 of my children, which sleep in different rooms!"
124076,1,I almost didn't buy this tent but my wife made me get this becuase she didn't want to lug our pack and play to the pool all summer. I don't regret it now that I've used it and have seen how easy it is to pop up and collapse. It offers great sun protection for our son and is very light and convenient. The Kwik Cabana 2 is very small so it's easy to pack up and comes in it's own pack. Our son had a blast in this all summer and took long naps in it when he wasn't playing in it. This tent is a godsend and way more convenient than an umbrella or travel crib/pack n play.
133540,1,"These bottles are great! These are the least expensive of the wide-mouth BPA-free bottles (at least that I could find), but still more than standard bottles. We have combatted that issue by only buying 4 bottles and washing them constantly (a little bit of a hassle, but a cheaper option). We are using them to serve expressed breastmilk, and we use the Mother's Milkmate system (Mothers Milkmate Storage Rack (10 Bottles)) for storage and heating, and then pour the milk into the bottle. I don't know how they would perform with formula.The only (VERY minor) drawbacks are: 1. They take a minute to assemble. It's not really very long considering some of the other bottles we've tried, and the venting system makes it totally worth it. 2. You can't really heat milk up IN the bottle... It's too thick. Heat it first, then pour.As far as the drop issue, I dropped one of mine 3 times in a row last night onto my kitchen floor (it was 3 am). I was worried it would break, but it was fine.We've tried several BPA-free bottles, and this is by far the best. Great venting system. Easy to hold (except at 3 am. :). Nipple is the best for minimizing nipple-confusion among the brands we've tried (including the Adiri Natural Nurser (Adiri Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 1 White, Slow Flow (0-3 months))"
101097,1,Have tested all diapers in the market and have found that these are the best.
67208,1,"bought this for my girl while she was pregnant to put under her desk at work. She continues to use it while feeding. Quality is pretty good, just don't use it as a stepping stool."
184281,1,"This is great if you like your baby close, but don't want to suffocate them. You can also fold it up nicely and travel with it. You can only use it for maybe 1 month or 2, I also just put my pack n play next to my bed with the bassinet top in case you don't want to get this, but I will be using this with any more children I have."
84390,1,"I just got this swing in the mail and it was so easy to set up in our front yard tree. My son is 7 months old and loves it! I love that is reclines as well as sits more upright, and seats up to 45 pounds. I expect my son to get lots of enjoyment from this swing. It is also a great price when compared with some similar swings."
103763,0,"I sent this item back once already and now it is starting to seem like it is defective again. When the song plays it sometimes gets stuck on one note and I have to turn it off and then back on again. I changed the batteries a million times and it's still doing it. My son loves it, but it always sounds like the batteries are dying and sometimes Elmo gets stuck below and I have to turn it off and back on again. Not worth the $$ in my opinion."
165739,1,I have bought Pampers since my son was born. I'm really satisfied with these diapers and I won't change them until my son is ready for potty training.
157938,1,"I babysat my cousin's child for months, and would cycle through his room every 5-10 minutes while he was sleeping to check on him, so when I became pregnant my husband and I knew we would need to do something different.We started by getting a pack and play for our room and then we bought the angelcare moniter. I sleep great! There is no better thing for a newborn parent to be able to say.Grandparents- get this for your kids, friends for your friends or parents buy this for yourself. May you never know the worry that comes from wondering - ""Is my baby still alive"". No other moniter can help give you that peace of mind.Worth every cent, and probably worth twice that much money ( I hope bebe sounds doesn't read that but it is true)UpdateThe range on these is great, I ended up taking the moniter outside and we could still hear Luke snoring half a block away!! Excellent moniter"
20089,0,"Before my son was born these bottles were recommended to me by a friend. At first I thought they were pretty cool because the bottom ring came off and I didn't really end up with a need for a bottle brush. HOWEVER - I have found that they leak no matter how the bottom vent discs are put in. I have always had the problem. Now, by leak I don't mean that the liquid is running out...I mean if left to sit for a period of time (with water in the bottle in a diaper bag or on the counter), when you pick up the bottle you will see little dropplets of water on the surface in exact location of the holes in the ""one way"" vent. Nursing didn't work out for us for a number of reasons so he has been formula fed. As a result, I need to take bottles with water in them in the diaper bag so that I can mix the formula when he needs to eat. I have often ended up with a wet diaper bag if the bottle ends up left there for any period of time. So sad...especially since they are amongst the most expensive bottles of the bunch!! I wish I would have stuck with my own opinion and insisted on the Avent bottles. I much prefer them!"
143544,1,This is such a great product. It keeps germs away and clean up is a breeze!
29463,1,"Pretty valance - may need something behind it as it is sort of thin, but perfect for little girls' rooms"
169563,1,We loved this diaper bag and it has stood up to 18 months of abuse. We have actually laundered it a few times in a laundry bag on the gentle cycle and it's been fine. I purchased this bag as a fathers day present for my husband before our son was born. He loved it and I loved it so much it became the only bag we used. There are so many pockets to sort out baby gear and carrying the bag as a messenger bag is helpful especially when it's full of baby gear. The stroller clips made it very convent and secure to attach to our BOB stroller. I wouldn't buy any other bag especially if you want dad to carry it around.
54797,2,"WHEN I REGISTERED FOR THIS MOBILE I IGNORED THE REVIEWS THAT SAID IT FALLS APART BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED IT FOR MY BABY. IT IS A GREAT CONCEPT BUT IT DID FALL ON MY BABY'S HEAD, IT ACTUALLY DOES NOT STAY ATTACHED TO THE ARM. WE HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS TIMES TO MAKE IT WORK BUT, IT KEEPS FALLING APART. DEFINATELY PLAN ON EXCHANGING IT."
56190,1,"Bought these bottles as a back-up system for my Nigerian Dwarf Goat kids in case there was a problem with Momma. Although I didn't have to use them, they were exactly what I needed for a great price."
122026,2,I just looked at this car seat tonight and I didn't buy it because of the short length of the buckle strap that goes between the legs. It is too short which would cause the hip straps to go across the legs/hip sockets instead of across the hip bones as recommended. I agree with Christina H. How can this possibly pass NTSB inspection? If anyone knows - boy would I like to hear it!!!!!
78223,1,This chair is wonderful! We take it with us when we go out to dinner or visit relatives. It folds up easily and is easy to clean. I love how the straps wind back into the chair so they aren't hanging. We don't use the side pocket because it doesn't stay closed but other than that we love this chair!
146178,1,"This Jumperoo is perfect. It keeps my princess entertained with all the cute toys. When we first bought it she didn't reach the floor, so we had to place a blanket, but she grew into it. So it wasn't no biggie."
146833,1,Another added attraction for my grandson the spiderman lover. I was also able to decorate other containers with these decals for example I purchased avon lotion and I put decals on it for my grandson.
75123,0,"This item definitly has some advantages but the best way I can describe it is ehhhh. It's VERY small and while it does work exactly as described any force behind the pee will ""shoot"" it right off plus with the size any decent amount of pee will soak the item and it will drip. Now honestly, dripping is MUCH better than getting shot in the face by a stream of pee but since the item is small and light it can easily be shot off. While this item does have it's advantages, something a little bigger with a slight more weight to it would be perfect. Not bad but not good either."
106378,1,"This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy."
55619,1,"The product was good and served its prupose.. At times there would be a leak from the bottle, I guess this was because we left it a little longer in there.. Easy to clean and used it well the initial 4 months of my newborn."
72056,2,"The rails work great, but they do not come with the rails to hold the mattress up. You need to have the rails to hold the mattress up because this bed does not require of fit a boxspring. My dad had to make these rails to hold the mattress up out of wood. Works great now, but make sure you have these rails handy when converting to the full size bed!"
69016,0,The length of the diaper is a little longer than a 6 but the waist is barely bigger. They claim it is good for 41 plus pounds but that is not true. Our little one is almost 35 pounds and we are already searching for a larger diaper as he is very tall (wears 6 - 8 clothing). If your size 6 has become too small these will work for a little while but start searching for a youth diaper soon so you have a back up just in case. Our little one does stay dry through the night with these. We change him about midnight and he wakes about 8 - 9 am. Hope that helps.
45859,1,"These are a very nice quality, however the dirty & clean bags are a little bulky for my diaper bag, but I still use them to keep stuff organized for my weekender bag or extra clothes bag for the car. I use the extras bag all the time in my diaper bag. I still have not used the snacks bag yet. Overall I am glad I bought these because they are useful to keep stuff organized for the baby sitters even though they are a little bulky."
144090,2,"I bought this chair for my son when he was 6 months old (2010) and the chair has now been used for a year. Right now, it looks pretty bad, not something that I would expect to use for too much longer. The finish is wearing off of every corner, edge or surface that is ever touched (even some surfaces that I don't think anyone touches). As a reference point my sister has 2x Stokke chairs that are ~10 years old and have seen two sets of kids, and they still look great. The ""cage"" that holds the tray really wouldn't sit level, except for the 1 month when my son was the perfect height. The plastic cover on the tray is almost impossible to get off to clean, and it is designed with cracks and crevices that catch food and are impossible to clean. I liked the looks when I first put it together, but it will never last until our 2nd child. I did a lot of research on chairs before I bought, and all of the reviews were great at the time-- but it looks like quality has gone down with the newer chairs."
369,0,"Pampers diapers are good. These Baby Dry diapers are cheaper than the Cruisers line of Pampers, but performance is the same so they are a great value. I deducted two stars because the smell of these diapers literally hurts my nose. The day the box arrived, it sat in our entryway from afternoon until the evening, and we could smell the diaper fragrance all the way from the back of the house. You can imagine how it was once we opened one package. I wish Pampers would stop adding that baby powder smell to mask the chemical smell to their diapers. VOC's? Don't know, but the strong fragrance and chemical smell gives me headaches. My husband thought I was exagerating until I handed him the baby. He asked what offensive lotion I had slathered the baby with, and I told him it was the diaper. He did not believe me and sniffed the baby's bottom and started coughing in disgust (and there was no poop). The fragrance is too strong and offensive."
15313,1,"I LOVE THIS! These blankets are amazingly soft and beautiful, truly exceeded my expectations. I bought two for my daughter's newborn twins, and they arrived quickly. We are DELIGHTED, and 100% satisfied. The quality is beautiful and they are so soft and fine. It's a joy to wrap my beautiful granddaughters in these fine, cashmere blankets. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Great price, excellent seller. Nicely packaged and TRULY GORGEOUS."
68366,1,"I use these for my 18 month old. I wont use anything else, they are very easy to clean, no internal parts. I love them.HAS NEVER LEAKED ONCE!!!!"
98498,1,Yes it is pricey but worth every penny. My daughters room is gorgeous and would have it no other room. We took the comforter and put it up on the wall and it made a great touch.
15193,2,"We used it for less than a month when our baby was just born. It held about 10 infant diapers, I cant imagine how many toddler diapers it would hold, 1? It was disgusting to have to push a dirty poopy diaper into that contraption. And in the end it still smelled. I actually returned mine it was so horrible. I would usually not return something my daughter's poop had touched, but this was such a horrible product I couldn't imagine supporting the company who made it.In the end we switched to cloth. They are amazingly easy to use and clean, way cheeper than disposables and they don't sit in a landfill for 500 YEARS! Thats how long disposables take to degrade. That is disgusting, great legacy for your baby to leave behind... I honestly feel guilty for even using disposables for a few weeks. SWITCH TO CLOTH!!"
107721,1,"The good:This pump is very good in function and practicality. you can take it to work and pump quietly. it does not need batteries or AC power.The cushion is VERY COMFORTABLE and it does stimulate the let-down reflex very quickly.You can pump directly into an Avent storage bottle or Avent baby bottle.The OK:The handle is average though - if you think of ergonomics.You have to lean forward quite a bit if you don't want the milk to accumulate in the neck and come back up in contact with your skin and contaminate your sterile milk.The Bad:I discovered that after a few uses, once you pump and the milk is flowing, the pump makes a goose/duck-like noise!! If you try pumping in the middle of the night while the little one sleeps, go to another room entirely!The little star valve is annoying when washing/boiling, because of its small size, you can easily lose it. This system provides an extra valve though.Otherwise, I have yet to find the perfect pump, but this one comes close."
157388,1,"Nice, sturdy changing table. Looks great in my baby girls room. Does take a little while to put it together, but I did it all by myself. The bottom piece of the changing table arrived with a crack in it. I emailed South Shore and they sent me a new piece right away. Great customer service!"
126879,2,These diapers do not fit my daughter at all. They leak all the time. I much prefer the cheap brand from walmart.
74232,0,"This looks like it will be a good stroller (just pulled it out of the box) but I just wanted to point out to readers that this is as big as a tandem double stroller. I thought it was going to be closer to the length of a single stroller with a little stand on the back for my older child but it is really quite large and I wonder if I wouldn't have been better off with a regular tandem stroller - I'm not planning on returning it and I have no complaints - other than it's not quite what I thought it was (which I admit I could have figured out if I had just compared the dimensions with other doubles before buying). So, my 3 star review is simply because I had in my mind something different so I'm not as excited about it as I thought I would be but for someone who is fine with something on the big side I suspect you'll love it."
125638,1,"Very colorful with lots of pieces to explore. My 5 month old daughter likes to put the plastic disks in her mouth and to finger the crinkly pieces. When we put her on the floor with her toys, she'll go for this one first and it keeps her busy for some time."
167973,0,"I am 6 months pregrnant and have a bad back, this pillow is good for a short period of time but you would like to turn from one side to another its very difficult to do. Made for short naps. Not made for a full nights sleep."
45122,1,"For the price, this is a great playmat. My 2-month old daughter is at the stage where she enjoys the lights, animals, and bright colors. It is also intriguing and visually appealing to her. She watches everything until she drifts off to sleep. This is truly entertaining!"
46890,2,"I ;ve bought this mobile yesterday, it seems like my daughter loves it, but music doesn't play for 10 minutes:(, It plays only for 2 maximum, so I have to go and turn it on again. I am little bit upset that I have to return it."
120781,1,Bought this item in Sept07. Its Nov09 and this gate is still keeping my 89 lb 10 yr old germand shepherd out of the kitchen. Best money I ever spent. Highly recommend.
168819,1,"These diapers are like clouds for your little angel's bum. Very soft with a subtle fresh scent.1. Number one choice of hospitals.2.Soft ,stretchy leg openings for comfort and security.3. The back is just a little higher than the front to prevent back blowouts.4.Designed to absorb soft messes.5. Wetness indicator changes color when wet.6.Secure, re-positionable tabs.7.Cute sesame street design on the front.8. Three individually wrapped bundles to keep the diapers fresh and neat until used or leave one with grandma or the babysitter.If they'd had these when my children were little I would have had more babies. Well, that's a complete dramatization o'course. :>"
32316,1,"These are decent for the price, but I was hoping for something a bit larger, to create a barrier under the 'whole' baby on a public changing station. I should have better read the size information. They weren't expensive, so I will definitely get my money's worth."
138332,1,"I bought this for my 22 month old son per the excellent reviews. He was having a hard time falling asleep at night...required my husband or I to stay in his room until he fell asleep. From the first night we used the turtle, he was able to fall asleep by himself. Once he goes in his crib, we turn the turtle on, he finds the moon and looks at all the stars. We can leave the room immediately and he falls asleep very quickly. Can't recommend it enough!"
17833,0,"My daughter loves this mobile since her birth and up untill now,she's almost 5 months old. However, it broke when she just turned 3 months and i cannot seem to find a replacement part for it and don't want to purchase the same one just for few more months. The same problem happened the mobile stopped spinning, instead it stocks at some point and clicking without spinning, however we still use it just like that, since music is playing just fine and lights is working fine as well. the clicking sound is pretty annoying though...In other words if this toy would be a better quality it would be a wonderful toy, babies love it."
66484,1,"Our son used a Fisher-Price rocker for the first three months of his life. He really was uninterested in it ... the toys were not interactive at all, and the seat looked uncomfortable. Additionally, it was difficult for mom and dad to use, as its design made placing him and removing him from the seat a chore.The people who designed this rocker, however, did an excellent job. The seat is a soft cushion that is large and plush (as noted in other reviews, the seat may be too big for newborns and small babies), which for our big baby was perfect. He still had plenty of room to grow!The toys that came with the rocker are also well designed, and encourage baby to interact with them. The starfish has a mirror, the lobster has a rattle, and the puffenfish can squeak when squeezed. The octopus is removable (again, great idea), and has different toys on each of his tentacles.The seat itself looks and feels extraordinarily comfortable, and the vibration function does not rattle a child's bones when new batteries are installed (The Fisher-Price chair had this problem -- if we left the vibrations on and lifted baby out, the chair would ""scoot"" across the floor for the first week as the vibrations were just jarring).Finally, the coup de grace for this product is the audio system. The chair comes with melodies and nature sounds that you can play at three volumes to create babies' own audio experience. In a act of tremendous foresight, Baby Einstein added a cable to allow you to hook up a portable CD or Mp3 player to the chair. The chair can hold up to 40 lbs, and I can think of few 40 lb children that would want to listen to Water Melodies over and over again. This allows the parents to use the child's favorite music for a more customized, personal experience. My son already has no doubt that this is ""his"" chair!Now to the things that were wrong with the chair: Expect the instructions to be so thorough to the point of treating you like an idiot. Putting the chair together is common sense, but the instructions literally take four or five steps to tell you which piece snaps where.The ""nature sounds"" also sound manufactured, almost as if they hired someone to make ""mouth sounds"" into a microphone for a few minutes, and then looped it.Finally, my only other complaint is that the toys on the toy bar (which swings out of the way --- great!) are a little too crowded. It's difficult for young babies to see them all and all of their features from where they sit.My advice: the only problems with this chair are incredibly minor. Spend the extra money and get this great product!"
169201,1,"These are the best diapers ever!! Seriously, I've tried every other major brand and there is no comparison. They even make Pampers own Dry Baby line look worse than something I could have made. The absorb away liner is my favorite feature. It sucks away all of the yucky stuff. You could cut a wipe in half and it would be more than enough to get that bottom clean. With Dry Baby I need at least 2-3 wipes per change. Super absorbent. My girl is a big pooper and an even bigger pee'er and I've NEVER HAD A LEAK. Obscene messes with others; I have to change her as soon as she goes to avoid a disaster. I change her half as much with these, BIG MONEY SAVER. If all that goodness isn't enough the quilted blanket softness is no joke. Let's just say I can touch her knees together in these and at best cross her ankles in the others. I'm going to cry when she's too big for them."
17896,1,"I received the 6 piece base unit a few days before this arrived and my 10 month old fussed whenever I put him in it- there wasn't as much room as I had hoped. Then we received the extentions- the amount of room it added was amazing!He happily plays in it, and I can get in, too!"
100272,0,"I bought these for my daughter when she was 6 months old so I could skip the night diaper change. Its pretty soggy in the morning, and if I wake up enough through the night, I will change her."
93837,1,"This was very easy to install. Yeah there were a lot of screws but it has held up to my four kids over two years. It is very easy to open and close for an adult. For kids, not quite so. My 9 and 7 year olds can do it but the 5 year old still has some difficulties. I love that this gate is higher than most (and even higher here because I installed it a bit higher than floor level) ... our 5 year old has to climb it, with some difficulty I must add, to get over. So this gate is holding up well to our 2 year old boy pulling and pulling on it, our 5 year old climber and two older kids opening and closing it (and climbing just for the heck too). We recommend it. We were even considering getting another one for another area but the other opening is too large. It didn't get the 5 stars only because the panels slide into each other and I've pinched myself on it. But ... no one else has ... so it's either a safety issue or it's just me. :-)"
97047,1,"Perfect for a newborn. All the sounds are nice, but the mother's heartbeat is the best. Highly recommend this for new babys."
134770,2,The first and most important thing about these pads is that they won't stay put for a long time. My son is a power crawler and they slip right off. You'd have to make them so tight that it would stop the blood flow in order to keep it in place. It drove me crazy adjusting them all the time. The other thing is the bulkiness. It really bothered my son and as much as he could he'd try to pull them off. I guess not very comfortable from his point of view. The material could be a bit more durable too. I'm afraid we didn't have much luck with these.
87030,1,"I own a 2010 Kia SOUL and these are JUST big enough to protect the seats from our Evenflo Triumph Advantage DLX seats. I imagine there may be seats with larger bases that might extend past the protection. Only complaint so far is that it's not actually long enough for the pockets to fully hang down in front of the seat itself. They are still usable, but not as much as if they if they hung down as designed."
140206,2,"This is an affordable stroller, but not even worth the $180.00. I have a 2 and 3 year old who have both gotten pinched at the folding mechanism while riding in the stroller. This is due to the fact that you have to lift the front end up to turn any sized corner. Last weekend my three year old got her entire pinky finger stuck in the joint (the folding joint is right at the kids' arm rest/elbow area). I had to unfold the stroller to get her finger out! This stroller is by far NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY! I just hope we can get our money back!We have a Subaru Forester, and even when folded, the stroller does not fit in the back without having 1/4 of the stroller hanging over the kid's heads in the backseat...horrible design."
146633,1,"My daughter has loved this jumparoo! She's used it since she was able to sit up and support her head and saw it the other day (22 months) and wanted in ...I know... probably a little too big, but she still had fun playing with it!There is so much to look at that she stayed entertained. The music is not too annoying for a noisy baby toy, and I like the two modes (one plays music constantly and the other mode only plays when she bounces or does something with one of the toys). I loved putting her in it and knowing it would ""do it's job"" long enough for me to take a shower when she was younger. :) The ONLY complaint I have is that the little button that you push to make the tiger play peek a boo is not that obvious... as in the tiger doesn't move up enough when she pushes it so she often thinks she's not pushing the button right. I love that the straps adjust, although I wish they would go a little lower, but I solved that by folding up a thick blanket when she was younger so her feet would touch enough to bounce. I have never worried about safety, and the ""seat"" is easy enough to take off and clean when giggly drool starts to show :). All and all 5 stars! Great toy, and I look forward to using it with my son who's due soon!"
4950,1,"These diapers are attractive with their lack of disney characters and natural looking color. They smell fine, and fit great. My only complaint is that the last pack I got was kind of ""crunchy"". 1/4 of the diapers had a hard part in the crotch. It didn't create any problems for my daughter wearing them, but it was a little disconcerting to be able to knock on the diaper as if it were armor. They have never leaked or failed in any way; just sometimes the diapers are hard in spots. I still prefer them over any other. Also, the last time I tried to order them, there were no Stage 3s."
68698,1,"With my preemie that just keeps gaining weight, we have flown through diaper sizes very fast. I purchased the 1-2s this time rather than the 1s or the 2s because there is a small size difference. The diaper is an in between size. It should be called the 1 and a half as not to confuse people who think there are two different sizes in there.My daughter has been in Huggies and they just didn't fit right. Although they looked extremely tight on her thighs, she would leak out of them. We dont have that problem with Pampers."
123993,1,"I'm not a big stroller user, but this one really is very useful for taking a sleeping baby for a walk after a car ride, etc.I have not had any issues with anything falling apart and pushing it is a breeze so far. It folds up really easily for me.I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the storage cloth compartment falls sometimes for me."
133707,2,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. I didn't have a problem with the screws but I did have an issue with the brackets. They were made of such soft plastic that they were unusable. When screwing the brackets to the wall, the screw went straight through the bracket hole (enlarging the pre-made hole in the bracket) and the bracket was able to just pop right off over the screws. How is this supposed to hold up furniture when it is of such poor quality that it can't even hold up to the screws? I will not be using this product and I would not recommend anyone buying it."
98078,2,"These bottles are terrible! My son could not get a drop out of them! I really thought that these would be the best bottle for my son, but they ended up just being a total waste of money."
168468,1,I have used Pampers Swaddlers with all 4 of my babies. These are the best diapers! They are soft and stretchy and the most comfortable for tiny babies. I ordered these from Amazon in the bulk package because it was the best way to save money on diapers and so convenient to have them delivered to my door.
30655,0,We have this monitor which is why I am searching for a new monitor. All in all it's not a bad monitor. It picks up our son's whimpers. It does have some static which does not bother us but for people who need quiet to sleep it may. Our issue is the battery life when the monitor is off the charger. There is no way the monitor can be off the charger for more than a couple of hours. We feel attached to an outlet when the baby is sleeping. Coincidentally we are probably going to go with another Graco model.
38854,1,"My cousin gave this to me as a shower gift. She loved it and now I am giving it to a friend for her shower. My daughter is 10 months and is still using it. It makes for easier bathing (hard to get around the baby in those plastic ring holders). We only have one tub at our house and it's really great that I can just hang it up on the shower head when we are done. It says it's mildew resistant...but I have seen a couple of spots a few times. I just throw it in the wash with a cup of bleach and it's as good as new! I would recommend this to every new mother! Oh, it's also easy (if you remember to keep the zip-up package) to carry with you if your child is bathing somewhere else."
109890,1,"Easy assembly, daughters never fallen out of the bed. Had it on the bed for 6 months now with no issues."
54981,1,"We tried 2 other toilet reducer seats before this one and this duck seat is by far the best: sturdy, fits in normal and larger/oval-shaped toilets, and comfortable for our son. We also like that it has the loop at the end - we hung a hook on the wall for it. Overall, a star!"
34405,0,"I have really tried to like this product. I like the fact that its all natural, love the smell, and I actually think it works quite well. But the packaging is pretty lousy, so I find that I never really for this cream. Its a thick product, which is good, but its really hard to squeeze out of this tube. And as other reviews mentioned, once you get to the bottom third, you really have a hard time getting it out of the package and always feel like you are leaving a lot of it to waste. Plus I think they need to make larger tubes so you don't waste so much packaging material. I think I'm going to go back to Triple Paste, much as I tried to switch to Burts."
106192,1,"I LOVE this diaper pail. We have the Odor-Less pail for our older child, and it was great until she learned how to open it herself. The Diaper Champ is both sturdier and cooler the way that it disposes of the diaper. It is a cinch to put in new trash bags too. I keep a bunch in the bottom for easy re-bagging. I just love that I can use regular trash bags and if I'm concerned about smells, then I'll throw a car air freshner in it....but it doesn't leak odor, so I probably won't have to. I'm just thoroughly impressed, and I love that my sneaky toddler can't open it. Definitely a must have for new parents!!!"
91951,1,"I chose this pillow because I am very picky about what I lay my head on. during the length of my pregnancy I used this pillow in conjunction with another which I placed between my knees. I found that the two together gave me much better hip support during the night. now that I am at the end of my pregnancy, I have learned the benefit of the support that this pillow gives my belly. I use the smaller end by my belly and the larger between my knees. I gave up on the second pillow that I use to add and found that now this pillow alone is more than sufficient. At one point, I stayed over at a friends where she pulled out her snoogle pillow for me to use. I hated it. it was too long and the pillow wanted to go under my head and wasn't as supportive as this boppy pillow is. I highly reccomend the boppy pillow. but it is a matter of taste and each person is different. in the end of the day, all you need is more support and you will be fine. Any way that you can find a solution to that is a plus."
142536,2,"This only comes up 2 inches above the mattress! My daughter could easily roll over it and onto the floor. They fail to mention that it is only compatible with thin mattresses. If you have a decent mattress or pillow top, this product will not work.....it's just not tall enough and there is no way to adjust it for the height of the mattress. Waste of money!"
45101,1,"I put this mat on our registry based on all the good reviews and I can't say enough good things about it. We got another activity mat as a gift as well, the Baby Einstein Baby Neptune, but this one by Tiny Love is far superior in quality, design and ease of use. When we first got it before my son's birth, i was so taken with it, i spent a good half hour just playing with it myself! My son is now nearly five months and has been using this gym since he was a couple weeks old. It's been amazing watching him interact with this mat as he develops different skills.The mat unfolds easily out of the box and is ready for play right away. The snap holding the arches together in the middle can be easily undone and the arches laid flat to enable baby to nap on the mat. The arches can also easily unsnap altogether when you need to wash the mat. I unsnapped the arches and curved them into my suitcase on top of the folded mat when i recently went overseas for an extended trip with my son. We spent two months out of the country and this Tiny Love mat went with us. He played and napped in it every day and i thanked my stars everyday that I had brought it.The dangling animals are incredibly cute and creatively designed with eye-catching colors and textures. My son loves to hold the monkey's hand as it dangles outstretched. He has gone from just looking at the parrot to actively fingering its crinkly wings. And he also has great fun with the 3-D elements on the mat -- he can spend 10 minutes just scrunching the big elephant's ear so he can hear it crinkle.The music and lights are soothing, never obnoxious. I've looked at a few other activity gyms and this one just seems head and shoulders above them all in terms of design and creativity. I'm planning on holding on to this for our next baby!"
17237,1,"Our daughter has Epilepsy and sometimes has trouble breathing during a seizure. I bought this product to help us keep tabs on her at night so we know when she needs help. Up to this point, she was sleeping in our bed with us. The picture is crisp even in low light and doesn't interfere with our cordless phone or wireless network. Now we will all get a better night's sleep."
120653,1,Love the Kushies and got my order before I was suppose to. Was suprised being it was the holidays that the order came before it was suppose to. Using the Kushies as burp clothes so wanted them soft. Thanks Mama for such prompt service...
156292,1,"I love the halo sleepsack products. My toddler is very active before he falls asleep and while he's sleeping. It gives me great piece of mind to know he's warm at night. Just like the sleepsacks for the smaller children/babies, this is made of high quality material and holds up wash after wash."
133926,1,"When my son was first born, he cried every time we used a wipe on him...he hates the cold wipes. We bought the warmer and the crying stopped. To this day, he HATES us using any wipes that didn't come out of the warmer. So, this has been a real life saver.The only drawbacks are:(1) The temperature in the warmer could be a a tad bit higher so that the wipes stay warm a little longer.2) You have to remember to add water to the unit and change the pad on a fairly regular basis. This isn't a big deal at all, as long as you do it regulary. But, when you're a new mom, it's easy to forget.Even with the drawbacks I listed above, I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone. In fact, I've bought a number of these for family members and friends and they love them, too!"
71316,1,We purchased this rocker for our son when he was born after having such success with one from 2001 when our daughter was born. That one from 2001 was purple and red and is still being used by our 4-yr-old as a toddler rocker. The kids have them side-by-side and use them when they cozy in for a video. I can't get my daughter's chair away from her.We have had no problems with these chairs from infancy through the toddler/preschool years! We've recommended them to all of our friends and family since they're useful long after the typical infant bouncy/vibrating seats.
168361,1,"Price reduced because box was opened. Arrived with the top taped closed and everything looked untampered with. With free shipping, hands down beats local deals."
106810,1,"I have been using the diaper champ since my son was born 3 months ago. This pail is fantastic. The pail is very simple to put together and is extremely simple to use, just put the diaper in and rotate the handle. I have no odor problems at all. From the beginning I put a stick up on the inside and I use the cheap vanilla scented bags from Walmart - great value you get like a 100 bags for $3. I have to change the bag once a week. I always roll the wipes and diaper up tightly together before putting in the champ - something I think some are not doing after reading a couple complaints. The lid is tough to open to change at first but seems to be loosening up over time, keep your nails on the shorter side and you'll be fine (should do that for baby anyway!). The only thing I regret is not having a second one!! Worth every cent!"
77321,2,The swing is lovely - colors are great but it's tight fitted - no space. My grandbaby was only 3 months and it was snug. The head support it sewed on therefore you can't remove it. The tray is a chore to take off and put on. The lightshow was great but the knobs and music worked at random. I returned it.
183580,1,"I knew that I wanted (and needed) many of the newer features availble on highchairs, but not ALL the extras. I have twins, B/G and we own two of these Colby Chairs (they come in many colors, colby was our favorite) and have had them since the twins were about 4 months old, that was 5 months ago!PROS->* The chair is VERY easy to clean, its all plastic and vinyl, there arent too many mystery crevises for those rouge cheerios and strained carrots, and it only takes me about 5-10 minutes to clean one whole chair (my friends aquarium takes her about 45 minutes a day, for one!!!)* The tray is big, it can hold a good sized plate (although we dont use plates too much). The trays size is also nice to prevent food from ending up on the floor, and to keep some food away from baby, to eat only a little bit at a time. Its pretty lightweight so I dont strain my arm taking it off, yes ARM, I can take it off wiht one hand, unlike MANY of the other ""one handed-release trays"". Its easy to clean, even without the dishwasher insert (we dont use that too much, just a wipe or a sponge, but the inserts nice on occasions). The cup holder is useful, and it keeps the drinks away when you want baby to eat.* The chair reqlines all the way for bottle feeding, and it sits ALL THE WAY UP for baby when they are eating, this is greatly appreciated to disencourage slouching and uncomfort.* The chair adjusts to all different heights, I cant imagine it not fitting at the top of someones table, we keep the twins close to make feeding easier...* The wheels actually move, they dont get stuck and they are easy to lock, and unlock with your feet.* The harness is a 5-pt. this keeps the babies safe and secure, but you could use it as a lap belt if you wanted as well.* The seat is very comfortable, its nice to be able to know that the twins wont be fidgeting through-out the whole meal.CONS->* Its a little tough to take the twins out, and put into, the seats, but thats no big deal for us, but it could be.* The chair is very warm, the twins always seem a little stuck to it or sweaty, especially when they are only in diapers, but that again is not a terrible problem for us.* Its a little on the big side, so if you have a small kitchen it may not be idealTHINGS WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT->* Price* The toy bar is entriging for the twins, they love it and its not in the way* The basket is great for bibsters and utensils* The chair can fold over for minimal space saving, but its not too compact.* There is a little snack tray under the big tray, for snacks! Easy to clean and to maintainSo we are still waiting for the chair with all the positives listed above, but without the unessasary things and the negitaves. But out of other chairs I have used at friends and families, the harmony highchair is very reliable and secure. I am not worried about saftey and the twins are always fine at the table. We all love this chair and recomend it for anyone with a baby."
180299,2,I bought this from Toys R us while on vacation because the Nuk I bought is a piece of junk. Well this isn't really much better. It loses suction very easily and is a pain the butt to get even the 4oz I need for a full feeding.
84690,1,"It's fun, at the same time difficult to have a lot of babies in the family esp during gatherings. So many things get lost and when you get back home, find out that most of your baby's Avent bottle caps are missing. Thanks to Amazon and Prime, with a few clicks of the mouse..2 days after, these replacements arrive. No tax, free 2 day shipping...simply awesome."
91077,1,"We were given a different more expensive brand, and I returned it. I could not understand why we would need a carrier for almost 3 times the amount that serves the same purpose. We have used this product during several outings and my husband doesnt mind using it. When my son was smaller and light my teenager was able to tote him around and he was happy.It does the trick and saves money"
155072,0,They seemed too loose fitting for our 7 lb. 15 oz. baby. THat means leakage and mess. The pampers at the hospital fit better.
57061,1,I am so glad I chose this model. I love everything about it.It was easy to install.The gate will automatically close if you want it to( or stay open.)I can open it with one hand.With the 2 extensions supplied you have a lot of latitude in width adjustment. For my doorway I had to leave one of the screw adjusters completely off.I am going to buy another one for another doorway.
165516,0,"I have been using this product with my daughter (she's 17 months) and all of a sudden, she started having rashes around her thighs (where the diaper wraps around). I tried all the rash cream, made a visit to the dr for more rash cream but that didn't help. I am now using Huggies and her rash is disappearing. Anyone else having this experience? Could it be possible that the bathc I had was just bad?????"
57041,1,This prouct was shipped very quickly. It arrived in great shape and was very easy to assemble. It works great.
115702,0,"This is a very good compact stroller.I wanted something which I could carry every day along with my son to 2nd flr. I looked at many umbrella strollers and most did not have 5 point harnesses. This one is good in that sense.Cons - Light weight, if I am shopping with my son and my bags are on stroller and if my son is not in stroller it will always fall down. Another issue is that the wheels are pretty close together and the handles don't tilt back far enough to provide a lot of separation between your feet and the wheels. You do have to walk heel-toe if you are going to walk behind the stroller and that not only takes a little getting used to, but can be tiring because you don't use your normal walking muscles.The basket underneath is very small.You can't put a bag of any size under there, but it's good for small purchases. Also, while it does recline, it's not much, but more than you would see on other umbrella strollers.If you want to use it everyday for walk, I would say buy different one. This is good only for travel purpose only."
51441,2,"We invested just over $200 in a dozen bumGenius 3.0 diapers a couple of weeks ago for my 27 month old son and 11 month old daughter. I loved them at first, but by the end of the very first week, we had the waterproofing completely fail on three of the diapers. While my son was wearing them, and less than an hour after I'd put them on him, he was absolutely soaked as though he had no diaper on at all. The leaking wasn't coming out the sides, but through the fabric cover! I was shocked with the first one, but by the third one, I was mad. Not only did it upset him (he actually had pee dripping from his shorts while we stood in line to pay at a grocery store!), but I had to wash bedding and a soaked carseat the two other times. I did contact Cotton Babies, where I purchased them, and they told me I must have used the wrong detergent. I had followed, very strictly, all washing instructions including using a detergent as recommended on their website. What I apparently didn't do right, was buy the Military version of this product! I wonder how many people have that option available to them? Anyway, I tried yesterday to restore the waterproofing in the way that Cotton Babies recommended, but then drove to 5 different stores (including Whole Foods, Henry's and our local Co-op) and could not find even one of the other recommended detergents. So now what do I do? I have $200 worth of diapers that I cannot use!"
141719,0,My son loves this toy it makes lots of noise and lights up and it is very durable but its not walker material when hes holding on to the toy all he wants to do is press the buttons and not walk with it I wouldnt reccomend this toy to anyone who is trying to get there child to walk its too distracting.
163751,1,My 5 month old daughter is able sit at the table with us now and my wife has not complained about it how it looks or the space it takes up. . .it's a win/win to me!
41252,1,real good. and they're comfortable and easy to use. what else can you say about diapers? no pee drips down his leg! actually... it's amazing how easy these are to use and how well they work. when you think about what our mothers had to work with... these are astonishing. he's happy. we're happy.
100364,2,"I bought these when they were a killer deal. I have a 4 month old and I have never used this brand before. BAD MISTAKE! They ended up giving my little girl a burn-like rash on her bottom and I only used 2 of them. It took almost a week for it to go away after I switched back to huggies. It was NOT a diaper rash, it was way worse, it happened almost instantly after I started use. I would not recommend to anyone. After I returned these (can I just say Amazon has the best customer service EVER!!!) I read reviews of other moms on different websites and it seems like I am not the only one this has happened too."
113101,1,"This little guy is so cute. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but it is adorable and a great teether. The body is soft and not filled so it is easy for baby to grasp."
166537,1,I like pampers-they are always a good safe choice for diapers. They seem to work well & I love the soft scent. No problems with leaks. Cute design
32908,2,"I found these cups to be a good transition for my daughter from the bottle. But like the Avent bottles, they leak all the time. I would expect a product that is so pricey to be top notch. These were far from it. I tried different packages and they all leaked to some degree. I would not recommend these unless you want to be cleaning up messes all the time!"
179711,1,"I have traveled alone with my little one a few times and I was so happy to have this! I needed a carseat at the other end of my travels and I wasn't terribly thrilled with the idea of having to check it and have it tossed about by luggage handlers so this was a bonus for that as well! Anyway, going through security I left my carseat attached to it and very sweetly asked for someone to hand check it. Never had any problems as far as that goes. If you have a stoller that you will want on the other end of your flight, I still think I would not check this, but check the stoller instead--again because of the car seat being tossed around. I had so many moms ask me what this was and where to find it. I can't stress enough how wonderful this was!"
83261,0,"I don't know how this product compares to others, but if there isn't anything better out there, it would be scary. The nail clippers are pathetic, the bulb syringe is useless and the emery boards are only good for one nail filing. The only thing I have found to be decent is the tooth brushes for my 1 year old to suck on while I change his diapers and the measuring syringe (although, even that, the measurements are rubbing off after only a few uses so, soon, we will not be able to tell how much we're measuring)."
162362,0,"I have used the thermometer numerous times under the arm, and it works well. However, the aspirator does not work well. The clippers are fine, &amp; I haven't yet needed to use the medicine dropper &amp; spoon. I like that I can take it all with me on trips."
88804,1,"Works for us - lowest price we've been able to find ANYWHERE, and my husband is seriously one of those 'research everything before you buy it' kinda guys."
114955,2,"I recently purchased this seat for my 16 month old. Who is 33 inches tall and 25 pounds. We just needed something for going over to friends and/or family dinners/lunches. My child looked like a giant in this seat. He's much to big. The tray was on the lower part of his belly(leaving his bib out in the open to play with), and his buns were just about to big to sit in the seat.I guess it's a nice booster for a smaller child, but if you are looking for something your child can use for a while I would recommend &quot;The First Years&quot; booster seat with tray. It works much better for a larger child..."
86544,0,"We had to have a wipey warmer and with our first baby it was an absolute requirement, all the way until he stopped wearing diapers. The second baby did not get a single warmed wipe. This one worked pretty well."
131975,2,The Graco SnugGlider is very cheap and sometimes works and sometimes does not. The on off switch came defective and can't get the dang thing to turn off without taking the batteries out each time. Great idea but lacks quality! I would not recommend this item.
171164,1,"I used this tub with my first daughter as a newborn, baby and up to a year until she was ready for the big tub. It was perfect! The size, desing and comfort.I saved it because even after daily use for a year this tub looked new! Now I am going to use it with my new baby! Don't look any further..Get this tub!!"
34876,0,I LOVE ALOT OF FEATURES THE CAR SEAT HAS TO OFFER.UNFORTUNEATELY I CAN NEVER GET MY SON TIGHT ENOUGHWITH THE STRAPS. THEY ARE VERY HARD TO TIGHTEN.THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE CAR SEAT AND I WISHIT WORKED BETTER.
126019,1,"I've used Huggies diapers with 3 kids because they fit better than the other big brand, being ""baby-shaped."" However, the last two boxes from amazon have been rectangular. They still claim to be baby shaped, but the shape of my son hasn't changed and the diapers have. They still cover his hiney and absorb the same."
128723,1,"I love the avent items. These are dishwasher safe, top rack only. They wash well and we use them every day."
183680,1,"I love this product. It's easy to use (both putting it on and taking it off). It completely covers all areas of the shopping cart surrounding the baby's seating area, keeping my 9-month old daughter's mouth off of the cart (yuck!). It's very cushy and she seems very comfortable in it. I also like that it has loops to hook toys onto and a little pocket to store a bottle or whatever. I would definitely recommend it over some of the other types of this product."
173223,1,This product is really helping on the seats and i am very satisfied with it.
29099,1,"This valance is adorable and matches the crib bedding set that I purchased somewhere else a few years ago. We moved into a new house and I needed another valance to match the previously purchased set. The quality is good, but when I put the valance up I noticed that it is not exactly the same as the ones I purchased about 2 years ago. The yellow fabric at the top of the valance is yellow as pictured, but it is made of a stiff cotton fabric instead of the soft, flannel-like fabric on the other two valances that I have. KidsLine may have changed their product in the past two years and I when up on the window it is not that noticeable. So I have kept the product despite my minor disappointment."
54685,0,"My daughter loves this mobile and that's why when the motor stopped working I returned it and exchanged it for a new one six times! Yes, you read it right. We bought one and the motor stopped working and then the next one stopped working and so on and so on....six times. They really need to make this item better but it so darn cute."
8185,1,"100% cotton is a plus. This fits standard contoured changing pad, even though it says it fits flat changing table cover."
34918,1,We just switched our baby to this car seat 3 weeks ago and he is 6 months old. I find that the buckle is very easy to operate and my baby seems to like being in the seat. The only problem I have is that in our 1998 Altima it is a little big for the center in the back with the driver's seat pushed all the way back. Overall though it is a great product.
165709,1,I pay MORE at my local store (price tax) and get LESS diapers per box (128) than this deal (176!). My only regret is not buying this way sooner. I could have saved hundreds in diaper costs over the span of 2 years that I've been buying diapers. I don't know if Costco or Sam's Club sell this specific brand in mega-size or bigger but I doubt you can get a better deal without leaving your home or paying a membership to get a cheaper deal. I will be buying diapers this way from now on.
90014,1,pampers are def the best diapers ever. tried a whole bunch of others but nothing holds like pampers do. so happy not to have to change clothing any more along with wet diapers
24465,0,"I'm in agreement with most of the other reviewers. The gate is a lifesaver when carrying a child plus groceries, etc. We chose it specifically because it was made of metal. Our dog chewed on all the wooden ones! The only thing wrong with the gate is the plastic foot pedal. Ours too broke off into little pieces after only 3 month of use. I thought we'd gotten a &quot;lemon&quot; until I read numerous other reviews stating the same problem. The company is sending a replacement, but after reading that many people are on their 2nd and 3rd pedals, I'm not optimistic! I'd give the gate 5 stars if the pedal was redesigned."
46002,2,"We got the stim-mobile for our son when he was just 3 weeks old. He has used it for the past three months. He does look at it, and it has become a familiar part of his ""landscape"". He prefers looking at lights and black and white objects that move, so these things grab his attention away from the mobile.I can't tell what effect it has on him. I do know that the plastic clamp and wand assembly looked so cheap, we didn't even try to use it. We put an eyebolt in the ceiling and hung it from a cord. The adjustment hooks work very well for raising and lowering the mobile. The card attachment is not secure on the mobile and this makes moving and changing cards difficult. Some of the holes punched in the card were too small to hook onto the mobile. But my biggest concern is that the plastic that the cards are made from is translucent, and when I look up at the mobile (as my son can only do) I see both the image on the side facing him AS WELL AS the ghost of the image on the reverse side. I can only imagine that this makes it very difficult for his brain to see a clear, crisp simple image, which is the whole point of this thing."
150415,0,"I recently bought this product and was excited to see how sturdy it was when i got it. The moon and stars add a soft touch to our little one's nursery and it holds quite a lot of baby laundry. However, I do have to say that the vinyl inner lining that actually holds the laundry tore after a week while trying to get it out of the hamper. Also, the tubes that hold the inner bag in place keep sliding out. If the inner bag were made of mesh perhaps, this hamper would be awesome!"
63378,1,I bought this for my daughter who has a underwater themed nursery and I loved it! I think I bought it a little late because she was learning to crawl and did not use at as long as I would have liked. She did like playing with it however.
59810,1,This can be you baby's bath from day 1... you'll love this one if you have been struggling with those smaller ones...
129470,1,My daughter likes this toy in her carseat. She holds onto it and then keeps holding it after she falls asleep in the car. I would have given it 5 stars but for some reason she only likes using it in the car...
6216,1,"I purchased this item from a baby shower gift registry. As far as I know, the recipient is very happy with the product."
172699,2,"This is probably the hardest to use baby tub, it is bulky and hard to use the shower with the newborn. the temp messure is barely legiable, and my baby hated it. My newborn kept sliding down and she barely fit length wise. She is 21inches long. I just used it for the first time before she went to bed and i am going to take it back asap. I think i will stick with the older style tubs."
92803,1,"If they made one of these things for adults, I'd get one!! My daughter LOVES this thing. It's got that crinkle-sounding paper that babies seem to love, and spins really easily. The colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands. I have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these!"
43601,0,"Got this gate for between the living room and kitchen. Liked the idea to pass thru and wanted a nice looking one that was pressure mounted. Well, the drywall is still messed up from the pressure points. Too loose and it can be pushed over. I can't count how many times we have tripped over this thing. This is coming down soon, being replaced by a gate mounted with hardware and without the bottom rail."
110856,1,This was the only thing my daughter would chew on when she was teething. I had to buy several more & keep them in plastic bags in the freezer so she always had one cold to chew on.
151244,0,"This stroller was given to our family as a donation, and I have to admit that it can be difficult to steer at times, but not as difficult as posted in previous reviews here. I love the sturdiness of the stroller, plus the fact that the seats are stadium style, so that both riders have a view. I have 2 1/2 year old twins, and this is by far my preferred way to stroll in the neighborhood. For regular outings in the car, I prefer a lighter stroller, as this one also proves to be much heavier to get in and out of the car. It is extremely easy to open and close/fold, and we are mostly pleased with it."
112433,0,"what happened?? pampers cruisers changed their long time staple diapers, and definitely NOT for the better. my son is getting diaper rash for the first time EVER, and they just aren't as absorbent."
154913,1,"I bought this chair after my 2 year old reffused to sit in the regular highchair, but was still not fully reaching the table to sit in a regular chair. This chair is great, my daughter loves it and any time my older nieces and nephews come over they fight over who gets to sit there ( and their ages range from 2 - 12 :-). Delivered quickly without problems and I am planning on getting another one soon, for my younger daughter who is almost 1yr now, so they won't fight over this one :-)"
12680,2,"I am a first time mom-to-be, I thought this would be a wonderful thing to have. I was wrong, I have not heard anything but my food digesting or my stomach growling! This is a complete waste of money! I put the monitor on my husband and my dogs and I heard the same noises I hear in my own tummy! Do not buy it!"
149725,1,"This is a beautiful little high chair that I purchased as a Christmas gift for our granddaughter. It arrived with the tray separated from the arms. The nails had been hammered over and the holes painted over. Since it was Christmas eve my husband used Gorilla Glue and C-clamps to hold the tray. So far it has held. My granddaughter loves the chair and I hope it will continue to hold. However, a broken product should never have been shipped."
152749,1,"I purchased this seat after reading all the other reviews. It's for my 3 year old grandchild who rides inmy car more frequently now. The carseat in his parent's car is a convertible and is heavy and has lots of straps.Now that he is bigger/older, this seat is more appropriate and SO much easier to handle, esp since I have a 2dr car and of course he rides in the back seat where it is awkward to take a heavier seat in and out as needed. The only strap is the car's seat belt which has a guide to hold it in place. The height of the back (with the belt guide) is adjustable and at 3 years and about 33lbs, the shortest position is perfect for him. He loves the print I chose which is brighter in tone and print than the others that this model is available in. My daughter is so impressed with the ease of use that she plans to buy one for her car."
80085,1,I have used this to goto New York and travel around on 5th Avenue and also in Mall and Car it is perfect for all these activities.
141553,1,This toy is great if you have a baby on the verge of walking. They can sit and play or stand and walk.
21945,2,"My parents bought this furniture set for my son thinking it would last. It's not going to make it to his 2nd birthday. We have to look into buy all new furniture for my baby's room now that he's 18 months. That's about how long this will last. Draw fronts are falling off when you open the drawers. The drawer bottoms slide out and his clothes get stuck or fall through and the drawer can't open. These problems have come from just light clothes in the drawer and gentle use. It also scratches easily and look like it's 20 years old, not a year and a half. Save yourself some money and spend the extra money initially to buy something made of real wood and that is built for you.Hope that helps some future parents from being annoyed with wasting money on this furniture."
125873,2,My low rating is less an indictment on the snug and dry and more the amazing upgrade with the Slip-Ons Slip ons rule the earth with an iron fist. I lve them .Wife loves them . darling daughter loves them . go slipons.
152613,1,"I was hesitant to buy this because I am normally frugal, but I researched and read the reviews. Then when I got it, I had buyers remorse and thought I should return it, it was so expensive. BUT, I decided to use it and am so glad I did! My 2 boys, 2 months and 3 yrs old both can ride in it. It has individual shades and it pushes easily and is very well made. Even the straps when adjusting them are nicely made and thought out. My husband says it is welded well and I like that the handle bar is adjustable. I wish it had a parent tray and snack trays, but that is the trade off. It's a very nice jogger and I am so glad I got it."
152242,1,"I purchased this animal bag a few months back and my daughter loves it almost as much as I do! It frees up the shelves in her closet, yet still allows me to easily cycle through letting her play with her favorite plushy of the day. For me, it's actually better than her closest for storage, because I had to keep all of her animals on the top shelf in the closet and it seems like every time I took one down, they all came tumbling down, and I was never able to put them back in an orderly manner. The three access windows are great and allow for plenty of view into the bag, and if there's a plushy that I'm sent looking for an it isn't right at the window, it isn't far away and it's really easy to get to.Oh yeah... and this product makes a good, safe jumping platform for a 2 year old. :)Gotta Love Boon!"
51243,1,"The snuggle is awesome! It provides great support in many positions! IDidn't want to spend $50 on a pregnancy pillow but I decided to because this is our first and I had heard great things and I figured I would get a lot of use out of it! When it arrived I wasn't feeling well and it laid on the couch with me, then I took it to Savannah with me and it spends almost every night with my husband and I in bed! We have a queen bed and it doesn't take up as much room as I would have thought!"
96500,0,"If you're looking for a wood high chair, this may suit your fancy, but just get an all wood one. I thought this was great having the look of a wood chair, but the functions of a new/plastic one. But not so.First, your child has to be able to sit up on their own completely to use it. Some of the other plastic ones tilt, so you can use it sooner. I had to feed my son cereal in his bouncer because of this.It's hard to clean. The tray that lifts out, stuff gets under it all the time, so you need to remove both to clean. My son, at under a year old, can also pull the top part out on his own already. The sides have so many notches and groves that get food in them too.It's also heavy, so you can't move it around very well. The belt is difficult to use, not quick and easy to snap.I do like the look (although, when you register you can't specify the color of the cover, which I wanted blue and got red)."
42163,1,I just got this and I love it! I wanted something nice for my baby and this ones is it! I love the removeable mesh bag. I live in apartments so I dont have a washer and dryer in my home. This is going to make taking my baby's laundry to the laundry room easier!
157245,2,"I purchased this breast pump after reading all of the great reviews and comparing it to others in anticipation for returning to work after 12 weeks of maternity leave. After 4 weeks of breastfeeding my son and occasionally pumping with an AVENT hand pump, I tried this out for the first time and was completely infuriated with the poor quality and performance. First, it is impossible to adjust the suction when you are holding both containers to your breast. I do not have a 3rd hand to do this and the knob is too small to adjust with and elbow or other appendage. The suction is so poor that I only got a trickle of milk out of each breast, even with it turned up to the maximum level! After 15 minutes of pumping I had about a half ounce in each container and ended up finishing with my hand pump in a total of 5 minutes. With the hand pump I get much higher suction and a constant stream of milk filling the container. I personally do not get hour long breaks at work every 3 hours to use this worthless pump and really expected better from this company. I do not know if I got a defective pump but intend to contact Medela in regards to getting a refund since it is impossible to return it for the almost $.. it cost me! I would NOT Recommend this to my worst enemy and think it is the biggest waste of money on the history of Earth that I am now stuck with."
35202,1,"We used the smaller size (fleece) for our newborn and I am certain it is one reason he learned to sleep through the night so young (8 weeks). We tried to wean him from it when he outgrew it, but he would flail his arms and wake himself up when we used the sleep sack. Our doctor said it was fine to continue swaddling him, so I invested in the bigger size, in this lighter fabric since it is getting warmer out. I love the flannel. It holds its shape, and it warm but not too warm. We only ended up using it for about 3 weeks before we found out by accident that he didn't need it anymore (it was in the washer, it was bedtime, so we tried the sleep sack again, which worked). Still, I am glad I bought it and would recommend it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the center velcro flap was harder to line up than on the smaller version."
174733,1,Bought this entire set for my little Grandaughter - Brooke - soon to be born. Her nursery will soon be painted by her Daddy and I'm sure that these cute little animals will brighten her world! Very happy with everything - service was great & items are well made with beautiful colors and lot's of dimension.
142281,1,"I was reluctant to buy one of these b/c of (1) the cost; and (2) the mixed reviews. Now, the only thing that I am disappointed about is the fact that I did not get one earlier. My son was 9 lbs when he was born, and hated every fabric sling that I bought. (They were too confining.) So, there was no chance that I'd have ""hands-free"" to do anything while he was awake. Finally, I broke down and bought the bjorn w/ extra back support. It's a dream. He falls asleep immediately and I am free to use my arms again. It's not the best for hiking or long walks b/c it can get tiring (like the horrific ninth month of pregnancy). But, it is great for any other short term endeavor. I recommend it. The price is worth your sanity."
93993,1,"With our first two children we used fashionable plastic bottles (read: expensive) and then learned about BPA. With our third child, we knew we couldn't use the hundreds of dollars worth of bottles we already had, and yet we could not imagine laying out hundreds of dollars AGAIN for now BPA-free bottles, so we chose the evenflo glass bottles. We've used those very successfully and now our darling son was big enough/old enough to need a faster flow nipple. I bought these despite the mixed reviews. The items I received have HOLES, not an X- perhaps that was an older version? Our son has no problem with the nipples, the flow seems just right, although he did have a short adjustment period at first where he was accustomed to sucking vigorously and he now doesn't have to suck as hard to get his milk. We inadvertently made that worse by not throwing away all the previous slower flow nipples right away, so poor little guy wasn't sure until he tried to suck which level of flow he was going to get. We rectified that and tossed the others out, which has resolved that completely. My one complaint is that like all other silicone nipples I use, in the dishwasher over time they end up getting a yellowish color, a little discolored - but it doesn't seem to affect their usefulness. Overall I have no complaints. They are useful, inexpensive, easily obtained, and a nice alternative to the pricy ""fashionable"" bottles."
181867,2,"didn't like it. it dried out my son's skin. it's smelt ok, but the lavander bath didn't help him fall asleep either."
11479,2,"We bought one of these - and the monitor stopped working after a few days. We thought, ah, a lemon, let's return and get a new one.Got a new one - same thing, after about a week the monitor stopped working."
12768,2,This system does not work as well as it states it will. It tries to give you a warning that if you are not that far along you will not be able to hear the baby heart beat and it also says the heart beat won't sound like it does in the doctor's office. My husband and I purchased this when I was 5 months and I'm now 8 months and we still can't honestly say we have heard the heart beat. We basically uses this now to talk to our baby. I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this.
9087,0,"As with other reviewers, I agree that this CD player eats batteries. However, I use the timer on it and it works much better than just allowing it to run all night. I disagree with the reviewers who contend that the night light is weak or dim. I think it is a perfect light; who really wants a super-bright light shining on their baby when they are trying to get them to sleep anyway? I have had no problems with the CD's skipping. The only reason I give this product 3 stars instead of more is because of the rate at which it uses batteries; I'd prefer the batteries last longer but, again, using the timer has helped even with that complaint."
35064,1,I bought our Designer 22 at Target when it was on clearance. It came with a stroller and in different colors. We absolutely love it. We had no trouble setting up the stroller and getting the base into the car. It is very easy to get in and out of the base and we love how comfy it looks. This is a great buy especially with the stroller!
32320,2,"I knew these where a cheap price when I bought them, so can't say that I didn't expect that it might be a cheap product which they are. They are soooo thin and flimsy. I was using Babies R Us store brand of disposible pads before and these don't even compare. They are so thin that they stick right to my baby's butt when changing and I'm wrestling with them to unstick them and try to get a diaper under my baby; they just fold and crinkle up. Not even worth $5. I'd say they're only worth $1. I do not plan to ever buy these again. Not recommended for every day use."
65833,0,"Don't get me wrong i love this thing but it does make froth like bubbles, so if you dont have the time to place them in the fridge and wait for the bubbles to leave then i wouldnt buy this item. I use this for the bottles i make up for those night time feedings. and for that i love this mixer! By the time I need the bottle all the froth is gone. (there are still some bubbles but probly not as much as u would get if you shook the bottle instead of using the mixer.)I use the Dr. Brown wideneck bottle but i think it would work great in any bottle. also i purchased mine at wal-mart for $3.96 plus tax. So u might want to check your local stores while your out shopping and save yourself the higher price and shipping charges."
40799,0,These are very good disposable diapers and my DD uses them at daycare 1/2 a day during the week. Nothing beats cloth diapers though. The cloth diapers of today are soooo great and so convenient. The only extra thing is a load of laundry every 3 or 4 days. I never have leaks or blow-outs with cloth...they are the best!
66079,1,"I work in a daycare, and had only seen one parent use these bottles, but she recommended them so highly that I was sold. I honestly can't compare them to any other bottles, because I've never used anything else, nor will I. I'm going on to my second baby now, and he/she will use the same ones that his/her brother used. My son was never colicky (or so much as cried, for that matter), absolutely NEVER spit up (which impressed the teachers in his room at the daycare), and while he would be gassy on occasion, I attribute it just to a part of infancy, and certainly not to the bottles. The nipples do seem to have a bit of a large hole, but for my little piggy it was perfect. The only thing that I would say that isn't great about them is the cleaning process, because they have so many nooks and crannies. Defintiely not enough of a problem to have me try any other brand, though. I hope that more people realize what great bottles they are, and that they become more popular. They're a little more pricey, but defintiley worth it. I recommend them to new moms at my center, and to anyone who reads this review!"
177345,1,"I bought this pump and rented an electric pump. Even though this takes a bit longer, I prefer this one. I think it is easy to use and I feel like I get more using this one. I also like the interchangeable bottles and storage containers. The only drawback is that there are quite a few parts and with the number of times I pump, it's a lot of washing. But it's the same with the electric pump too, so I think it's just part of the game!"
107717,1,"My first child was born prematurely and the docs told us we had to use breastmilk to help him survive and thrive. I tried the hospital grade pump, but it became very painful. After a few months of torture, we had to go to a wedding in a neighboring town and since I would be going back to work shortly, I needed a hand pump. I bought an inexpensive one and saw very quickly that it wouldn't work for me. I got a few drops of milk and that was it. I threw it out and bought the Avent. Not only did I get more milk more quickly than the electric (and by far than the other manual), but it was very comfortable to use and stored easily. Cleaning was a breeze and it worked without fail everytime.With the Avent, I was able to feed my oldest breastmilk for 2 years. Now we have a second child and I've been pumping away happily for almost 6 months - a total of 2.5 years with this same pump! I get so much milk, I have to donate to a milk bank.The only problem I had with it was about 6 months after I got it. The ""star valve"" wouldn't stay put. I called customer service, which was super nice, and ordered a replacement. It must have been a faulty one to begin with as I've used this valve ever since.A word to the wise -- skip the 4 oz bottles and invest in the 9 oz. Baby grows into them quickly and for storage and pumping purposes, they work out much better. Also, the easiest way to clean the pump and bottles is to buy the actual Avent bottle brush. It lasts forever unlike the cheap ones."
59605,2,Too much modification to fit my fireplace hearth. I gave up.
15228,1,"This is alright, it keeps most oders away and easy to put the dirty diapers somewhere. The only thing is when the bags run out, they can get pricey when you have to keep buying them. overall though i give it a 4 out of 5."
175638,1,This is a must have for all infants. It keeps them so warm and helps them sleep. Just wish they made them for adults too! :)
165359,1,"I love PAMPERS.. I have a little boy and some people game me Huggies at my baby shower and every night he would be wet clear through the diaper and his jammies, I switched him to Pampers and he stayed dry nightly.. I LOVE THESE DIAPERS!!!"
175855,1,I love love love the baby k'tan. I had tried 5 other carriers before finding this one. Now I have 2 of them and I use it every day!! My baby loves it and it is so easy to use. Great for going into stores quickly. I can't say enough great things about this carrier. Try it!!!!
174884,1,"I am buying a second pad for my daughter's mattress, and I feel compelled to leave a review. I should first clarify that only the cotton exterior of this pad is organic; of course, polyurethane is not organic -- I do not see anything deceptive about the company's advertising. That said, polyurethane is a relatively-safe plastic, as opposed to vinyl, which is the typical pad liner. Vinyl off-gasses all sorts of nasty VOCs, but polyurethane is considerably safer. I would prefer water-repellent nylon, but PUL is certainly superior to PVC.I should also note that all of those folks complaining about the PUL liner are going to have to get used to wet crib mattresses, as there is no natural/organic fabric of which I am aware that is truly waterproof. Wool is water-repellent, but it is not waterproof, and it is a common allergen.Finally, I want to add that this is a very high-quality pad. It is durable, comfortable, and well-made."
105742,1,"I rarely write reviews or comments, however after purchasing yet another Diaper Champ, I decided to add my two cents for this product. Firstly, I am not a parent, altho I hope to be someday soon. I am, however, an Uncle to many many children of dear friends and family. And the first gift I send upon the announcement of a new born on-the-way is the Diaper Champ - yes, it's my default baby gift. I would like to add that I used to give the Genie but after learning that the great thing about the Diaper Champ is the flexibility of bags that it houses - very important upon emergency - it was a no-brainer... Once, a friend's wife was somewhat unappreciative of my offering - she's of the HM type - and thot I should've given something more glamorous. That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops. I immediately received a call with a sincere apology and was blessed enough to never need another visit to a church again. My reiteration that altho ""this gift ain't sexy, you may just name your next child after me for it,"" may yet hold true. Other than that one time, I've never heard anything other than praise for the Champ. Two couples even bought extras after they had twins... The only CON to this product that from now on, whenever my friends see ""ka-ka,"" they'll think of me... Could be worse I guess."
64763,1,"I registered for this as a secondary swing -- figuring that I'd take it with me when we went to visit the grandparents. It's now set up in my bedroom for those nights when Josh won't sleep.I've taken it with me when visiting friends and relatives and it's easy to fold up and carry plus, it gives Josh (who is only 5 weeks old) something to do besides being held."
146459,1,"Our child loved this from a very young age. Some days he would bounce himself to sleep from excitement. The adjustable straps work well for changing as your baby grows taller. Having the removable and machine washable seat is nice and the rest of it wipes up very well with cleaning wipes. It doesn't travel very well, but does collapse a bit for moving it."
130644,1,"I bought this before we had our son. I was able to put him in it from day one, it reclines far enough and even has a built in head rest so his head didnt flop to the side. He usually swings cradle and LOVES it. He is 2 months old now and see the fish hanging from the mobile and loves them, he even sits in the chair without it swinging and loves it. Its very easy to fold and lightweight to move. I also own the aquarium high chair and HIGHLY reccomend it also along with the bouncer. This is a great collection and fisher price did it again."
8560,1,I'm satisfied with these; we had some inferior ones from Home Depot that our 5-month old daughter had no problem peeling off of the furniture. These fit snugly and tightly.
86078,1,"5 stars;Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld ColorVideo Monitor with 1.8"" Screen - Silvership/sold via amazongood video and excellent audio.audio stays on,no automatic audio turn off in 5 minutes.reliable.had it over 2 years.buy it."
115916,1,I received this as a gift at my baby shower for our son and I loved it. I have used this towel so much and it has held up perfectly for almost a year. I am putting a Rose version on my registry for our daughter and if I don't get it I will definitely order it myself.
160418,2,"Don't get this kind. They have fun designs but they are hard to clean. There are crevices were poo and pee can get stuck. Another main problem is the plastic molding that holds the cushion. It's sticking up a little bit in the inside circle and when the cushion gets pressed the buttocks get dented. Whenever my 2 yr old sits on this potty seat her buttocks would get red and the plastic molding would leave a mark. She would complain that it hurts to sit there for a long time. :( I just bought ""Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat"" It's amazing. No boo boos. And easy to clean. :)"
11411,1,"We recently moved into a two story house. I bought this for my wife because we have a two year-old who still takes naps and hasn't quite mastered the art of going down stairs yet! My wife knows exactly when our little one is waking up. The receiver works everywhere throughout the house. She said that she can even hear her breathing. Also, she has taken the receiver with our oldest daughter down to the bus stop a couple times (which is a few houses down the block)and she could still hear what was going on! I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
78604,2,"I used this to travel from Boston to Dallas. It fit great and I was very excited to have both my child and my suitcase rolling with one hand. However, it was SO inconvenient when going through security. I had to unlatch it from the bag and then re-latch after all the hoops they make you jump through these days while holding my 9 month old. Then, when I gate-checked it, they wouldn't give me my bag back with the carseat when changing planes because ""they aren't allowed to return baggage"". !? Maybe it was just the airline I flew (Midwest) but I imagine it's probably similar on most airlines. So, I had to carry my baby through the airport. It would have been better to bring a real stroller and just check everything (which I did on our next trip).So, don't do this unless you know for sure you can have it back when changing planes. If you aren't changing planes you still have to re-latch it after exiting the plane which is a pain b/c you have 200 people exiting with you and you want to bend down and configure a carseat onto a carry on bag with a baby/toddler in tow.It was a real bummer."
169118,1,"This is a great diaper. Unfortunately, I am somewhat of an absent minded first time mom. Swaddlers really keep my newborn dry(after a pee) and not complaining like he does with other diapers we've tried. This is better than Huggies and way better than Pampers Baby Dry (leaks, not very absorbent). This one does not leak. Tape feels secure and doesn't land on baby's skin."
153212,2,"I thought I would really like this seat when I purchased it. I was looking for something that would work well until my child was big enough to need a booster, then work as a comfy booster as well. Problem is, the seat is almost impossible to install properly in most vehicles. I happen to have captain's seats in my van, and was able to rig it using the adjustments on the seat itself so that the carseat is in properly, but that is the ONLY way! I am a certified carseat tech too, so its not just a matter of not knowing how. My other complaint is the scoop of the back - when the child falls asleep, her head falls forward. Not very comfortable. I am hoping this works better as a booster."
53169,1,This is a great idea!! I have purchased 3 sets for people I know who have little ones!! I also have to order another set to send to my niece who is soon to be a new mom...she was impressed by this as well. I had never heard of these until a friend of mine raved about them to me. Great ordering and a timely receipt of my order. Thanks.
68259,0,"i love how much more comfortable this is than a real (large, bulky) towel on my head, but it doesn't do much to absorb moisture. My hair definitely takes longer to dry after using this than it does after wrapping my head in a regular towel."
14697,0,"I have 8 of the 4 oz. bottles & they all leak??? I really like the size & comfort of the bottles, but they leak all the time. They are expensive bottles, so they shouldn't have this flaw.I am going to try ...to not screw the caps on so tight. If I can't stop them from leaking...next time I will try a different brand of bottle (and a cheaper one at that.)"
17155,2,"I had the Safety 1st monitor and broke it, so I decided to try this one since it was cheaper. The info said that it would work up to 60 feet away. The distance we had it was less than 50 feet and all I could get was a fuzzy picture and loud static. Even though there was no noise in the room, there was a lot of static. After 2 nights of hearing the static I brought it back and spent the extra money for another Safety 1st monitor, which comes in beautifully."
35772,1,"I would be nice if the zippers went all the way up to the top. My son is tall for his age and the zippers on the sides don't go high enough. It is a convenient and quality product, though. It is washable, very warm and soft, and easy to use."
167784,1,I bought this to go with my bee themed nursery set. It was super expensive but I have been using it for quite a while and it is very adorable. I am sure that we will be using it for a long time to come.
9792,1,"I bought this potty for my 2 yr. old boy after wasting money on a cheaper 3-in-1 potty. I thought I would be saving money by getting something that was a potty, stool, and separate seat all in one, but my son hated it for various reasons. I ended up buying this one after being unsuccessful with the other one for months. I opened it in front of him when it arrived and made a big deal out of it, and he immediately sat on it and stayed there for a while, pretending. Within the next week, he started running to get it and bringing it into the living room so he could sit on it while he watched his Elmo's Potty Time DVD. Within the week after that, he began wanting to try to go potty in it, and did! I should have just listened to the fantastic reviews and gotten this one in the first place!I love this potty chair because: It only has two pieces, making it very easy to clean immediately after use. It comes in a variety of colors, so you can get it in your child's favorite. It has a rubber-lined bottom edge that keeps it from slipping around, so it is very stable while your child is still wary about sturdying him/herself to sit down onto it. The bump that helps your boy keep his pee in the potty is small enough so there is no trouble sitting down. It has a sleek design that doesn't look too childish sitting in a shared bathroom, yet is still appealing to children. It was small enough so my son fit snugly in it, yet it had enough room so he could readjust to find a comfortable position for his bottom. My boy is very tall for his age and he had no issues with it being too short for him, though he is also lean. If your child is quite thick, Baby Bjorn makes a large potty seat that might be more appropriate."
179271,2,"The idea of the bottles is good. They do help to reduce air. However, to me, it was not worth it b/c of the problems we had with the nipples. It seemed like every nipple had some sort of problem. EVERY bottle I bought was a newborn bottle- with newborn nipples ( I double and triple checked), but for some reason they ALL had different flows! Some would choke and gag him, some didn't even work and NOTHING would come out, some were okay... you get the point. It was always a guessing game with these bottles. We had to constantly try to keep up with which nipples were the good ones and which ones didn't work. And when you have a hungry, fussy baby, its no fun to be wasting time trying to keep up with stuff like that. On top of the fact that we had 20 bottles and only 2-3 nipples that worked the way they were supposed to. Another issue we had was that the nipples all colapsed! It was horrible. He would suck 10 times and the nipple would be colapsed. I felt that these bottles were very poor quality. Like I said, the idea of the VentAire is good, but the bottles just aren't up to my expectations."
99878,1,"As a new mom, I've tried couple of different brands,, and Pampers is the winner. For this specific one, it's great for the cost, but it does not come with wetness indicator... which is something you can live without.. but the ones with it, help quite a bit. But can't complain when you have to change diaper like 12+ times a day, the cost comes as a big player in purchasing such items."
72222,1,"I highly recommend this product! It provides lots of entertainment for a baby evenas young as 5 months, which is when I first rcv'd this as a gift. It has been thebest gift ever. My baby loves to ""walk"" around and around in the seat and now at 7 1/2months he has started running around in circles. He loves all the toys and chews onthem as well, which are great for teething. The toys are also interchangeableand if he/she should get bored, you can purchase new ones and keep it new.The piano on this toy is also fabulous. This is a great purchase whether it's for yourown baby or as a gift. Thumbs up on this one!"
126161,1,We used to buy our diapers at one of the warehouse stores. When I saw the price per diaper on mom.com I knew I wouldn't be lugging cases of diapers to my car anymore.
52796,1,"I really wanted this chair for my baby and got one as a shower gift. He really loved it the first month and a half or so. He would sleep in it for hours. However now that he's a little older (just over 2 months) he really doesn't think it's that great. He'll sit there for short periods of time, but since it only vibrates and doesn't bounce, he gets bored. We ended up getting an old bouncy chair from a relative that he likes a lot more. I would still recommend the Baby Papasan for people with young babies. It was a godsend the first month or so!"
5298,1,"With the new plastic scare in baby bottles, these bottles are the best. They are BPA free, come in very cute colors, they are easy to wash and very affordable compared to other BPA bottles available. But make sure to order extra nipples when ordering these bottles because the nipples can be difficult to find."
116008,1,Just what I wanted..a nice place for my baby to rest. The liner is reversible and the fabrics are very nice quality. Really like the fact the hood can be taken off as this is the only one like it on the market that I have found..great!
177206,0,"I originally wasn't going to get a changing table, but last minute decided on this one based on look, price and reviews. I have had it for 2 years now. The table is pretty sturdy, but you have to tighten the screws every couple of months. My biggest complaint is the back piece came off and almost impossible to get it back on with all the little spindles. At this point, we have basically given up after glueing it back together. For the price, it is easier to go buy a new one for our second child on the way. The weight restrictions are a little low and I think the company does that to cover their butts. My son is 29 pounds now and climbs up on to the changing table and I have never worried about it. I love the shelves for storage on diapers, wipes, clothes....."
26160,1,"Overall very good, but assembly could be easier, takes a while.Still, it is highly recommended."
153060,1,"I did a TON of research before buying this seat, and we LOVED it so much we bought another! It is by far the easiest to use (I've used A LOT of car seats!) and has the best features. I really like that you don't have to take the seat out to adjust the harness height. The fact that this seat can be used forward facing up to 65lbs and 49"" is what sold me on it the most. I wish this seat had been around for my first child, who was off the charts for height, we had to put him in a booster seat at age 2 because he was too tall for any car seat we could find. The total side impact protection is another BIG selling point, no other seat has that! it is easy to install, rear and forward facing-I have used it in an explorer, escape and tahoe with no problems. People have said it is bulky, but it is not really any larger then other seats, just taller. Compare them side to side at the store and you will see :-) The seat is also very comfortable on long trips (8hrs with no complaints!). Another thing I really like about this seat is that the straps don't get twisted! We had a Alpha Omega and the straps were forever twisted and were such a pain! We have been using this seat for a year with no complaints what so ever. There are so many wonderful things about this seat I could go on all day. I had the seat inspected and the person told me that Britax IS THE BEST, far exceeding US safety standards. It is well worth the price for the peace of mind you will have. We also have the Britax Parkway booster seat with the total side impact protection and love it as well!PS- I have read from others that the seat cover is not machine washable, I washed it on delicate in cold water and it did no damage-looks as good as new!***UPDATE*** We have been using this seat for two years now and still love it. Our son is comfortable, no complaints about the crotch strap, it has been so easy to wipe spills from the fabric, simple to install and no problems with the shoulder straps twisting like on other seats we owned in the past. So comfy in fact that even at this age he has no problem sleeping in it. We will be using this seat for a very long time!!!"
184404,1,"This is one of my favorite purchases. Some people have complained about its short length but my baby is in the 95th percentile for weight & height at 4 months and she still has room to grow in it. We no longer need to use it in our bed as she sleeps fine in her crib but we still use it for other purposes around our home & will for travel soon. After 4 months it still looks brand new & has held up very nicely. If I could change anything I would make the yellow bar near the feet, which helps keep the baby from sliding down, removable so I could use it even longer!"
109263,1,I know it says it is a food holder but it is just a mess for food... however it is WONDERFUL for holding ice for a teething baby and good luck getting them to let you put it away when they are not teething:). I would say the only bad thing about using this to give the baby ice while teething is that at age 5 my son is still addicted to eating ice.
47650,0,I heard a famous tv mom raving about this product online so I thought I would give it a try.I didn't think it was anything special and I went back to using Phisoderm Baby which has awonderful scent and cleans really well.
6343,2,"Used this for a week monitoring my son in the adjoining room.Reception was OK - but the quality of picture was extremely bad. During the day the picture quality was like watching a 1960's TV - which is OK - it's only a $[...] piece of electronics. But in a dark room at night, the picture provided is so poor that you can't see anything. While the camera claims to have night vision, it doesn't provide anything that comes close.So if you need something that works at night (which is sort of the whole purpose of a monitor) then this product won't do the trick. I returned this product."
137578,0,"Let me start off by saying that this nightlight is very cute. BUT, reading the directions it says to place it in the middle of the room 5-6 ft away from the ceiling. Uhhhh, ok! Anway, i put it on the dresser which is against the wall, the stars and moons are cute but this light kept my 21 month old up for 2 hours instead of her soothing her. She normally sleeps within 15-20 minutes. I don't know, it's very cute but I just don't see the purpose in it."
29534,1,"We just got this last weekend, and my son loves it. He hasn't figured out how to tear around in it yet, but he's getting there. He chuckles and laughs when he takes a half step foreward and then another back. It was very easy for me to assemble by myself. I also like being able to set his sippy cup in it. It's a riot watching him try to figure out how to drink from the sippy cup on the jeep. He hasn't figured out that he needs to pick it up from the cup holder yet so I have to help him. He likes to honk the horn and look around in the jeep. It's also a nice change from his entertainer saucer."
176390,1,Very easy to use and clean. I'm a first time mother and only breastfeed my infant. I tried this pump and found it to be wonderful. Two other mothers recommended it to me and I would recommend it to others.
64223,0,"My wife and I have spent countless hours at this poing trying to find a true jogging stroller, reviewed by someone who jogs. What we've found is that most jogging strollers are like SUV's. Yes, they could be used for their intended purpose, but that might ruin the shiny tires and trim packages. The instructions for this stroller clearly state it is not intended for jogging. The stroller is intended to accept the carrier style car seats for babies under 20lbs. It is a fairly good fit, except that the stroller does not allow the car seat to lock into place. To stabilize the car seat, there is a very awkward strap that connect to the strollers 5 point harness. The strap is very difficult to tighten. After a phone call to the cust. serv. office regarding this strap (I assumed I was doing something wrong as I couldn't get it to tighten on the car seat) , I learned the strap is just difficult to tighten and since the stroller is meant for jogging, its probably not an issue. The service rep., who was very nice and willing to help, informed me a ""fast walk"" would be ok, but that jogging would not be comfortable.Fit and finish seem pretty solid, if you dont want to jog, then this stroller has just about everything you need and more. We haven't had any problems with the brake and really like how robust the braking system is. A kickstand is extended to stabilize the stroller along with engaging the brake. Nice touch.I would buy this product if I didn't need something to jog with and just want the look/style of a jogging stroller. For the price, you cant find a better deal."
128084,1,"A friend gave us one of these blankets when our son was born, and I figured it was just another of the many blankets we amassed, most of which we'd never use. But when I washed it this blanket became amazingly soft, and its size allowed for far easier swaddling than any other blanket. I now give these to all new parents and recommend bringing them to the hospital to use in lieu of the provided swaddles."
149422,1,"I purchased this pillow for my son as I was tired of seeing him slumped over in his car seat while he slept.With the RestUpRight pillow, he is secure and alligned in his carseat and sleeps with a straight spine. The pillow is adjustable and the fabic is really soft. Also, its VERY easy to use!! It is well-made and it comes with straps so that the pillow goes over the seatbelt and it does not slip down while he sleeps."
173832,1,"Our son had very bad reflux, and wasn't able to be on his back, especially when he slept. We had him in his swing for naps so that he wouldn't choke when he threw up. Now that he's older, he has figured out how to throw his weight over to one side, and I hadn't noticed when we registered for it that there is no 5 point harness. That's one of the drawbacks of the swing when they get older. We had no problems when he was a newborn. He LOVES the mirror under the mobile, however the butterfly and birds are pretty much useless since they all face outwards instead of down towards the baby's field of vision."
55454,2,I tried to research whether this bottle warmer would work well with my Born Free glass bottles but I was unable to locate information so I ordered it to try it out. Instruction manual states not recommended for glass bottles. I tried to warm my glass bottle anyways but it turned out dangerously hot. I then tried to warm the bottle in the attachment included to warm baby food jars but it did not heat the glass bottle at all. I returned this product and went back to warming my glass bottles by placing them in a mug of hot water.
78413,1,"I could not find a high chair that did not take up half of the kitchen table. This is perfect for my 8 month old. She loves being at the same level as the adults and its very easy to clean up. After meal time, I just wipe it down because its all plastic! Very practical. I agree that the tray may soon be too small but I will just let her use the kitchen table as her tray!Highly recommended!"
18476,1,"Our little Sophie would scream due to her gas pains, until that is we switched from Avent to Dr. Brown's. We could &quot;hear&quot; the bubbles (that high-pitched squeaking sound)she was ingesting while drinking from those Avent bottles. We even suggested Dr. B's to my cousin's baby who was getting bounced around from formula-to-formula via her pediatrician, who assumed it was just the formula making her &quot;colicky&quot;. Ever since she made the switch to Dr. Brown's her little girl has been a vison of health and happiness."
1106,1,very good price/quality....sort delivery.best price on the market.Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 Diapers Economy Pack Plus 246 Countthoses diapers are the best i found. I like the design on it
1271,0,"I decided to do subscribe and save for diapers. However, this last box of diapers we received we probably ""wasted"" about 1/4 of them because the sides would rip off. We are on our next box and I will be observing teh quality. If this quality of box is the same I will just go back to buying them in the store. Though I'm all about a good deal and ease of delivery, to waste that many diapers is frustrating and a waste of money."
62102,1,This was exactly what I needed and at a cheaper price than I could get at any store. I will be purchasing these again! Shipping came quick too.
7052,1,"The Cruisers are a step ahead of other products. It's more confortable, and doesn't cause diaper rash even after long hours. This is definitely better than Huggies Supreme."
116491,1,"I LOVE this diaper bag, it is stylish and I get a ton of compliments on it. I saved a lot of money by buying it from Amazon instead of Target!! Wont be disappointed"
92835,1,"My 4 month old daughter loves the spin and play garden. It's the perfect tummy time play mat!!! I just wish it had been around when my son was that little. He's 19 months old and plays with his sister with the attached toys. It's a must have for any new baby! It is well built and even stands up to my son's not so gentle touch. It stores easy when not in use, and is easy to clean. This is definately worth the money you pay for it. I just can't help but sing the praises of this wonderful toy!!!!"
120135,2,"My son has been very gassy and not only did these not help the situation, they only made it worse! I made sure the ""even flow"" nipples were level 1 and they flowed to quickly. My son choked on the formula and consistently showed distress when drinking from the bottle. They made for a miserable feeding."
51181,0,"I had high hopes for the Snoogle, but it felt cumbersome in my bed. Every time I got up or tried to roll over, I felt like I was wrestling with it. The cover it comes with is stiff and not soft. I wish it came with a jersey cover instead of having to pay an extra $20+ to get one. I haven't given up on the pillow as it might come in handy later in pregnancy, but currently, it's been moved off the bed."
127748,1,"We have a very small room for our toddler (less than 100 sq.ft.). We started out with a mini-crib so that we could fit as much as possible into the room - glider, changing table, storage shelving - without the room being too crowded. It was great. Once our kid's head and toes touched the opposite ends of the crib, we knew we had to upgrade. If we chose to add a twin bed to the room, one or two of the other pieces of furniture would have to be removed, thus taking away valuable storage. PLus, he's an active sleeper and still needs ""boundaries."" This bed is perfect. It fits as well as possible in the room and seems to be one of the only toddler beds with the option to fully enclose the sleeping space (yet still allow the kid to climb in and out safely). It's a winner for our needs."
103330,2,I would buy this product if I could only figure out how wide it is!
110916,0,Baby's will chew on either end. im not sure how well it really works to clean the teeth but esp good while teething.
138285,1,"We love our turtle, it is so cute and sweet. The three tones are very relaxing. It is also described as a learning tool, it has a nice pamphlet. The sepertate colors project different constelations and the amber does not glow brightly enough to make out specific stars. We are very happy with it anyway."
32806,1,"First I tried a Snugli, then a sling thing and then different brand of front loading carrier that was less expensive. All had MAJOR flaws in the design - the Snugli killed my back, the sling thing swallowed the baby up like a giant fish mouth and also hung too low no matter what I did, and the last carrier was so complicated I just gave up, frustrated. It literally had two pages of instructions and diagrams.When I finally broke down and bought the Baby Bjorn it was luxurious! The above problems -- all gone! They say this is the gold standard in baby carriers and I must agree.The only problems other parents and I have had are that: 1) the baby isn't too crazy about it and, 2)one size does not fit all. I think it's either the plastic snap-lock contraption that's rubbing their little legs in the crotch, or that it's too confining or tight for baby. But I was persistent, and pretty soon my baby adjusted. We've been on countless walks with it and he's content for about 30 minutes to an hour max. Also, larger folks will need to get the larger strap system, purchased separately.I'm going to keep searching for the perfect one, but those seeking a great all-around carrier, this one is worth the money..."
109955,2,LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME. I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED.
123897,0,"I have two of these seats in different colors and so does my neighbor. One of the first things I need to mention is that overall it is a good seat. However, as a booster seat it is not very good. It is hard to buckle the regular belt through it as a booster. Also, the belt positives are removable and my daughter had no problem getting them off when she turned 3. One of the seats is missing the postitioners since we could not find where she put it. The fact that these postitioners are just attached to the fabric does not seem to be very safe to me. Also, the cup holders are not very strong. One of mine and my neighbors broke (on the part that connects to the seat). Lastly, the while you can remove the harness systems to use it as a booster seat the bottom buckle is not removable and is a pain for my daughter. Overall, I would say buy it as a car seat as a transition between a infant seat and a booster."
42518,1,"My son went from being under 7 lbs at birth to 17 lbs at 4 months. I should have been strength training to keep up with his growth, but luckily I had a Moby wrap. Even though I have a history of back problems, I can wear him for hours without any discomfort at all.It did take me several attempts to get it wrapped correctly but once I got it, we were both thrilled. I wish I hadn't been intimidated by wraps when my daughter was small.I have a pouch, an Ergo, a mei tai and have used ring slings and backpacks. The Moby is by far my favorite. It is comfortable in cold and warm weather, easily adjustable, and washable."
181815,1,So far it is working out. Lots of room for everything and the best thing it is all in one place.
8663,1,"As a mother of a three year old and a four year old and dealing with the side by side double stroler you will do anything literally to ease the back pain and these connecters are amazing , we used them at six flags for the first time and even my husband pushed the strollers what a shock!{laughing}if you have children and need a break on the back try these connectors trust me you will love them.Two umbrella strollers with the connectors fit through any door !Thumbs up !!!!"
120657,0,The Diapers seemed to be of good quality but I thought there were a dozen in the package instead of only 6. That's my mistake. I would never pay nearly $18 for only 6 diapers.
146348,1,"My daughter LOVED her jumperoo! She started sitting in it at around 3 months of age and once she figured out what it was for, she was so happy and was hilarious to watch. She loved sitting in it as much as she loved her swing, but it allowed her a view of the room and she was able to play. I can't wait to see what our son thinks of it. We have the best home videos of our little one in this. It's awesome!"
41493,1,"... they are offering a special deal. Otherwise, you can buy them cheaper at BRU using their $5 off coupon AND a manufacturer coupon."
117689,1,"The shipping of this jumper was super fast, received it the next day! My little one was very content sitting in it, and has gotten spinning down.... we're working on the bouncing part.She is little for her age... in 0-3mo clothes and only 13lbs at 5+ months, which makes this jumper huge for her, but I just add a blanket and it works fine.As others have stated the only draw back is that the height is WAY too long... it is too long for our average height doorways, but at the highest adjustment is Ok for now on our one super high doorway. If you're handy, which we are, you can easily re-do the strap at a higher length with a cut and re-stitching. I'm sure that that negates any warranty, and some may worry about safety issues... but basically you will be doing the same think the company did, just at a higher height."
94507,0,"I also had trouble with the Avent bottles leaking. Usually only a couple drops dribble down the outside of the bottle, but my bigger problem is that my son's face and neck are covered in milk when he's done. I don't know -- maybe it's just the shape of his particular mouth/face or the way he sucks, but we had no trouble with other brands!"
32629,1,"I purchased a single playden but it ended up looking like a cage - too small. The product photo always shows the product with a couple of additional panels added. I was unable to find any vendor who sold these additional panels (sold in increments of 2, I believe). So, I purchased another complete playden with gate and put the two together. It is now a respectable size - just large enough to not scream ""caged baby"". I would like to purchase a third playden which would expand the space to the size of a small room when my budget allows. Great quality product."
104561,1,I give this 5 stars. It is excellent to take on campouts with my cub scouts and on family vacations. It has definitely been a space saver. My 3 boys use these washcloths all of the time.
55350,1,I puchased this to go under my carseat and I too brought my car to the state police to have it installed and they did not say not to use it for the car. Infact I have leather seats and it actually stops the carseat from sliding because of the grips on the bottom of it! Overall it has saved my seats and has not allowed the carseat to move! I would buy again in a heartbeat!!
108989,0,"When using the car seat with this Stroller, there is very little room for your 2nd child to sit. They can but will be leaning a bit forward. They can stand all they want, which is what my child did most so he could talk to his new baby sister.It's bulkier then the other sit and stand strollers, but it folds really easy and you cannot beat the storage on this stroller. The storage on this stroller is a huge plus if you are going for longer outings and dont want to wear a bag.There are 2 issues that we have with our stroller that need to be addressed by the company before this stroller can get higher marks:The forward facing seat's back support does not stay locked in place like it should, causing some problems when it reclines by suprise. I hope this is a problem with just ours and not the whole line, but it happens far to often.Biggest problem for street walking is that there is ZERO suspension on this stroller making for a really bumpy ride. You feel every crack in the sidewalk. Now my 3 yrold says thats not a big deal, its part of the fun, I say after a couple of miles you, the driver feel it. It really could use a little buffering where that is concerned. If you are a mall walker it is wonderful for those conditions, but outside is a bumpy matter.We love the storage and how our kids fit on this stroller, which is why we still use it all the time. We have found that the older child wants to walk more on our trips, likes being able to sit or stand without having to be jammed up next to his little sister like some of the side by sides. We like our stroller and recommend it, just remember what we have said about sidewalks."
137799,1,"we have two of these and even as an adult, I love lying next to my kids and looking up at the stars. It's pretty bright, plus it's good incentive for your kids to accept a darker room. They sleep better once the stars go out after 30 minutes. In honesty, I strapped this to our ceiling fan in our living room, turned it on low and had a makeshift disco ball for an after-dinner dance party. It was really sweet. Of course, if you try this, use some common sense. You could damage your ceiling fan, and the centrifugal force will likely send the turtle flying off and injuring someone...so one second thought, I don't recommend trying that. It was a pretty stupid/awesome thing to do.Anyway, my kids love it. Anyone that complains that the stars aren't bright enough, probably have too much ambient light in the room. After your eyes adjust, this little thing puts out more than enough light to see around the room. Highly recommended."
84740,2,"I agree with another review. This only works on round door knobs. With other common shapes, agile adults cannot even open the door. It's also difficult to later remove the product from the knob. The Safety First product is easier for adults to use, easier for adults to remove, and keep 2.5 yr olds out of rooms."
59328,0,I hate to be vain but this looks awful. It does serve it's purpose of keeping my baby from falling down the stairs which is most important. I am counting down the days until I can get rid of it though.
143126,2,"I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent."
86564,0,"This particular wipes warmer really does a job in drying out the wipes. I am adding water every day to keep them moist, and I am only filling it with a half packet of wipes at a time.The Ultimate Wipes Warmer by Prince Lionheart is a slightly better product. It has a moist pad at the base which does a better job of keeping the wipes moist, and the dispenser opening is slightly more rigid so you aren't pulling 3 wipes out with every reach.I know this will come in handy as winter approaches, if I have the patience to continue using it."
139453,1,"I had bought this for my 2yr old daughter whom seemed facinated with stars. This had some rudimentary constellations and all the stars are the same size, very large. There are 3 colors to change to, but the amber is very dim and hard to see. Even with these small insignificantdetails, my daughter thinks it is the best thing, and requests it every bedtime for the the past 6 months. She drags it around and plays ""tent"" with it as she lays and looks at them. If your child has any interest in stars, this will give that one a load of joy."
162863,1,I can't believe I don't see them everywhere. We made a special trip to a store we heard carried them because we saw our friend's in use. Great for any kid that is ready for finger food. Keeps house and car tidy.
133198,2,"I bought this for my first baby and at first it was great. When the diapers are not that stinky, the dekor is a good diaper pail. When you start to give your baby food and the diapers begin to smell, then the dekor starts to smell. You could walk into her room and it was awful. (and yes, I would change the dekor often) Which was another issue - having to purchase their refills got to be pretty pricey. We just had our second daughter 2 months ago and we had to get a different one - we could not even wash the smell out of the diaper dekor - we threw it in the trash. :o("
26205,1,"This bag has been so convenient! I can fit both of my kid's carseats in one bag (Britax Roundabout and Graco Booster with a back). Even though I have two bags it's easier to lug just one while traveling alone with the kids. It rolls so nicely! It has held up pretty well considering it has flown with us on many, many flights in the past 3 years."
3684,1,"This is good if it's what you're looking for. It's on the small side and folds up small. It was the perfect height for me but if you're taller than 5'6"" or so, it might be a little short for you. It serves the purpose I needed it for, which is, to have a small portable stroller for travel that was easy to use."
38024,1,"Very nice, thank You. Also delivered in time. It is my third set of Crocodile Creek Placemat since 2010. Kids really love it. The only one things - the design is washed out a little to fast.. but maybe it is normal or quality improved now?"
49053,1,"This is my second superyard. The first one I bought many years ago when the superyard was made with protruding metal hinges which were somewhat hazardous and invited mouthing by little teethers. Aside from being a little stiff to fold (which might be because it is new) this model is a vast improvment over the old. It's a couple of inches taller and seems sturdier. Great for blocking off the Christmas tree or any other part of the house. Cruising babies love to go round and round the inside and you can hang a busy box or other toys on the side to amuse a crawling baby.During football season, my friends and I take our superyards to tailgate and join them together to make a super superyard, so all the toddlers can safely play together. It's easy to clean using the pressure nozzle on the hose outdoors. Minor drawback is that it can be scooted across the floor or climbed out of by a determined toddler. Do I really need to say that any play yard should always be used only under adult supervision? Final comment - one of the most useful pieces of child-care equipment I'veever owned. The only reason I gave it 4 stars insteat of 5 is because my experiences with North States' customer service has been poor."
103015,0,"We originally bought this seat because we lived in a small apartment, and only had room for a highchair we could strap onto a kitchen chair. It is a very durable product. It is a good space saver, and I like the fact that it comes with a tray, and the tray does fit in the dishwasher :). However, our tray comes off VERY easily (my daughter merely pushed a little and it popped right off). Also, on certain chairs, we cannot get the straps that fasten it to a chair to tighten enough, so the seat moves around a lot. (And the straps are easy to lose if you don't keep close track of them.) Like some of the other reviewers, I found it to be a good food storage area! Seriously, food gets caught in all the crevices, and it is not easy to clean unless you take it apart. I don't know if there's a better fold-up booster seat/highchair out there, but I would only recommend this seat for going places, and then to use it with close supervision. We now only use it when we go somewhere or go in the backyard, and I'll be darned if I can keep those straps with the seat!! We have to put it on the ground now because we can't fasten it to a chair. We have a real highchair in our house now that we have some room, but I would like to switch to a booster (my son is 2 1/2--it's about time). I don't want to bring this one in the house because it's so hard to clean up after meals (the booster and the chair underneath--unless you want to scrub the finish off your chairs because you didn't know the food was leaking down under the booster!). On the positive side, the seat has lasted 6 years and is still in great condition. I just wish the seat were designed better!"
55999,1,"It works good but I didnt realize it used steam to heat them. Not a problem though. Also using the bottles that take liners you have to use more water or put it in more than once to get it to a warm temp. But all in all I really like it, have yet to use it for warming baby food but looking forward to it."
129836,0,"All graco bases are not the same. When you get your seat in the car, check it to be sure that it dosnt rock around a lot. If it does, return it for a new base. some of these bases have an extra hump of plastic in the bottom that keeps the seat more secure in it and others do not. We opened and tried out 6 bases before we found one that we were comfortable with."
38270,1,This gate is very sturdy and great to keep our 1 year old off the stairs but easy to open and walk through.
35845,1,"I recently purchased one of these for my small baby, who refuses to sleep anywhere but his car seat. What a godsend this thing is! It's thick, warm and comfortable, and is much easier to use than the blankets we were lining the car seat with. We keep the seat belts out of the way when using the seat like this. It's easy to tuck baby snugly in for the night without a ton of blankets. It's also great for using on the go with the seat belt threaded through (winters are brutal here in the Midwest). I've tried a lot of different covers and configurations and this one is the best for all our needs- both at home and on the go."
77791,1,"I ordered this chair for my 6 month old granddaughter's and I love it. It was easy to assemble and is very convenient. It also came with a tote bag so it's easy to take with me. The chair is well made and securely attaches to the table, I highly recommend it!"
92039,1,"The bag is very stylish and the thing I was looking for ""waterproof"" for those dirty cloth diapers on the go. But I was disappointed in the size of the bag. It may only fit up to 3 fuzzi bunz cloth diapers at a time. We are accustom to taking long road trips and outings so this bag was not for us."
51710,0,"I read the four reviews that Amazon had and decided to buy it. I have twins and they had colic so I needed something right away because I couldn't take 4 hrs of crying anymore. I didn't want to wait and by chance I saw it in Sears for the same price and bought it. My son hated it, as soon as I put him in the swing he started crying even more and wouldn't stop. But my daughter liked it and was falling asleep in it. She sometimes slept in it for 3-4 hrs which gave her a little bit flat head. A few things that I didn't like:1. Speed, although it says it has six speeds mainly it's only two and you won't be able to tell the difference.2. Doesn't recline far. I just found out after 3 months of using it that it had 3 recline positions, wish I had known before so I could prevent the flat head for which I have to take my dd to a therapist.3.The tray comes in you way when you are putting your baby in the swing so I never used it.4. The color is so boring. It's just blah.. they should have made it with bright colors since it's for babies.5. Toys are also dull and not bright colored.6. The fabric is very cheap. After only a few weeks of use it looks worn out and had fur balls.7. Gave my dd flat head. The head kept dropping.8. You can't put rolled up blanket or anything to support the head since it doesn't recline far enough.I only bought it since it was plug in swing and was going to save me money on batteries. Also, saved me from going insane with the twins. That's why I gave it 3 stars. But we feel guilty now for leaving our dd in the swing for more than a few minutes. I now only use it from time to time not for my dd but for my ds. He doesn't hate it that much and can sit in it for 10-20 mins."
155959,1,"We already owned one, just wanted to pick up another for the next kid. It's great. If you can get one, do it."
182696,0,"In my case, I have a 26 lb one-year-old boy who kicks and squirms for all diaper changes, but he loves getting dresses. So, I thought he would like pulling on diapers like he loves pulling on his pants. This much turned out to be true.I will have to order a larger size next time, as these are too small and when he does number two, it always squished out all over his back.The problem I'm not sure a larger size will fix is the absorbency. I need a pull on diaper, not a training pant. I didn't count on less absorbency, but we go through these things like crazy and we've had many leaks! I switched from seventh generation diapers, which are very absorbent, but not available in a pull on.I checked out the new Huggies pull on diapers, but the price is outrageous! The other pull ups don't offer open/close sides.In conclusion, I liked these enough to see if the larger size works better, considering the limited alternative options."
29048,1,"We bought this stroller for our 8 month old and we love it. The only but is the straps could be a little more secure, but other than that it's great for the money."
143201,1,When you need to pack bottles for travel these are perfect and definitely serve their purpose. No leaking. Very pleased.
106125,1,"I love this product! With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones. Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great. No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!"
11644,2,"We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar. The infant size tub was fine, and still works okay after 2 years. However, the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak. The first one we bought had a very slow leak; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak, so we bought another one, thinking we wouldn't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.Wrong!!The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub. At first it was so slow, it just meant we'd have to reinflate it once in a while; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it won't last through one bathing without going limp. After the second flop, I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement. They never responded to my friendly letter. When I finally called (took me a while to get around to it; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now!), they were totally unhelpful.The woman who answered at ""Customer Service"" kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns, and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer. Way to stand behind your products, dudes!Then when I called the retalier (Right Start) just now, they said that it's not their responsibility to handle a replacement, it's the manufacturer's-- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she's ask her boss and look into it more, just to see if there is anything they can do.I'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers, especially repeat customers such as myself. I mean, come on, how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy??However, since that is their attitude, you're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life (non-virtual) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy, such as Babies-R-Us or Target, so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement. That's what we'll be doing from here on out.So long, Kel-Gar. The tub was ""just ducky"" but your service was DOA!Update: No go on the replacment. Big surprise.Although not quite as cushy as this tub, I would highly recommend getting your baby or toddler the PRIMO EuroBath instead. We got it after having to give up on inflatables, and it is roomy, comfortable, and DURABLE, unlike Kel-Gar's products. 4.5 stars with 750 reviews on Amazon- you can't beat that!PRIMO EuroBath Pearl White"
114804,1,"We have one of these and it's fantastic. My daughter is now too old to like being in the car seat when we go to a restaurant, and this is a great next step, especially if the restaurant doesn't have any high chairs available. It's wonderfully portable, sturdy, straps securely to pretty much any dining chair, easy to clean, easy to adjust, well-designed, and my daughter always seems content and happy in it. Highly recommended!"
23883,1,My baby sleeps so well in her swaddle. Perfect for my newborn. It's a great baby shower gift. Love it!
84731,0,"i got these after seeing these at my sister's house. they seem to work for her - she has a 2.5 year old.however, these were useless in my household. my 3.5 year old son wasn't able to turn the handle with the cover on, however he was able to take the cover apart in about a minute and open the door...bottom line - the usefulness of these covers is determined by age and persistence of your kids."
149860,1,"It seems like a great product, unfortunately, on our 20 hour drive neither of my kids wanted to use it. Not too happy I spent 40 dollars on something they won't use. So, my review is, looks great, but can't comment on how it works."
63242,0,"This pacifier would of been great if I had given it too my daughter when she was younger. I was tired of cleaning of pacifiers that she drops at 10 months and found this one. She didn't take to it as she was used to the old one. I love how it closes when it hits the ground. However, when she picks it up off the ground she can't open it back up to reuse and tries to stick the whole thing w/ the plastic cover back into her mouth and that doesn't work well. So I don't use it as pacifier anymore it is more of a toy when we are shopping that she plays with trying to open and close!"
84499,1,"My grandson Wyatt now 9 months old, loves his new swing. The swing seems to be really safe for little ones. The only thing is that it is a little difficult to remove the tray to get him out, however since it seems to be so safe and very cute design we can deal with this little problem. We took pictures of him in his new swing and he was really smiling."
7709,1,This smells like JPG Le Male for less than half the price. Why pay twice as much for a torso bottle? This is the smart choice.
24266,1,"We ordered this to use with the co-sleeper. The color matches exactly the sleeper,we ordered the toffee, but its kind of a dull color, the green would have probably been nicer. The sheet fits snugly and is easy to get on and off and once washed it soft and not to chaffy for the baby. Overall a good product."
51738,0,"I got it as a baby shower gift, and mainly liked it since it can plug into the wall. My son is only a month old right now, but he doesn't really like to nap in it. It's good when I need to get something done though, because he likes to be constantly held by me. And I tend to make the swing go a bit faster by just helping it along abit then it keeps that speed going. But it's fine for what I need right now.ETA: 3 years later. The musical part broke within 6 months. I forgot that I wrote a review. I wanted to add this in for people to know it may break."
94759,0,"These wipes are a nice size, but they leave little fuzzies behind. They are also pretty stiff if dried on the line."
37053,2,"My husband and I purchased 2 of the Summit car seats over 1 1/2 years ago. We had 2 Fisher Price 2 in 1 car seats which we are still using and are completely happy with, but with baby 2 we needed additional seats. We purchased the Summit after talking to store personnel about the safety and features. They are the biggest pain to deal with.1. The straps twist like crazy (the Fisher Price ones and our Graco infant seat never once have).2.The top lock on the harness is too easy for a child to open and after some time, doesn't even stay on locked on one of the two anymore.3. If my child falls asleep in the seat, his head about touches his knees, which can't be all that safe.4. We had to buy a locking mechanism to get it to install tight enough in the vehicles we drive (no SUVs -- we've had them in cars, trucks and mini-vans).5. My son (and now my daughter since they like to switch seats occassionally) constantly complain about their feet and legs falling asleep in the seats. This never happens in our other car seats.We have noticed that Cosco has made some minor improvements since we purchased ours....the belts are made of thicker material now and the top lock on the harness is different and a little better made now.We still would never recommend one to any consumer and have made a point to discourage other shoppers at local stores while there. We are going to cut our losses and replace both seats."
136845,1,I love this seat! It is well made and has great safety ratings. The print is very handsome. There is nothing about this seat that feels chincy or cheap. It is also relatively easy to install as car seats go. I highly recommend it.
146894,2,"We bought the skip hop playspot even after reading all the lukewarm/negative reviews because of the pretty color. My daughter started using it at 5 months old when she was just starting to sit up by herself. It was fine then because she wasn't really moving all that much and still hadn't learned to start picking up and grabbing everything in sight. It's now 3 months later and she's beginning to crawl, that's when I noticed that the mat separates very easily, gets easily scratched up, and has many pieces (especially all the little connector pieces) which she grabs and eats. I think the mat's days are numbered and we'll have to go buy a mat that doesn't have all the little pieces and sturdier connections that she won't be able to take apart as easily. Too bad other mat makers don't seem to be catching on to the color feature."
106701,1,We love our Diaper Champ because you can use regular kitchen bags. We have to dump it every other day because it fills up so we are so glad we do not have to buy special expensive bags for it.
135624,0,"Overall, it is a fair stroller.Objections: I found this stroller didn't manuever as well as other strollers. On uneven, broken pavement, this stroller can come to a jolting standstill at larger cracks; it was especially bad on the snowy, icy sidewalks. I had to pick it up and lift it over snow because I couldn't push it over. This stroller is difficult to open. The cup holders are poorly designed. The front one is not crafted as one piece with the snack tray; it slips easily out of the tray. Ours is always falling out and we have lost it a couple of times. The rear cup holder isn't much better. The bolt that connects it comes loose and was lost the first month we owned this stroller.On the positive side, the storage bin is large and easy to access. It is not overly heavy. The canopy is large and has a clear plastic window so a parent can view their child while pushing the stroller. It also locks into place so a child cannot push it back. The seat reclines part way to accomodate a sleepy child."
121662,1,Love this pillow! It's great because you can use it for arios holds- the sides are sized well enough so you can use it for a football hold a well as a cradle or cross cradle. I learned the hard way that you need to vary your holds to avoid problems like plugged ducts - my other pillow- Brest friend- is great but can't do side holds. Mama and baby give ths one 2 thumbs up!
76057,0,"I was looking for a lidded ice cube tray for freezing my homemade baby foods and thought this would fit the bill. It's okay but needs some improvements.1. The ice cube tray has too little compartments. It's smaller than the average ice cube tray so I was disappointed that it didn't fit more food.2. The ice cube tray has very, very little ""give."" This means that once the food is frozen, I have to wait until my husband gets home to try to get the food cubes out. I could do it with a lot of effort - letting it thaw a little bit (but don't want to risk it thawing out too much) and then working hard to get it out. It would have been better if the material was more like silicone, so that it can release the food easily."
150136,1,"Britax Marathon was the easy chioce for me. Excellent growth up to 49""-65 lbs as a 5-point harness. The seat was extremely easy to install with the latch system and versa tether strap.I especailly liked the head support on the side which is reassuring for side impacts. The marathon is well padded and my 7 month old Jack looks so comfy in his seat that I wanted to jump in there with him.There are better prices online as one amazon consumer stated in her review online about traveling tikes.com. They are selling the same marathon at $219.99 shipping and tax included. They had a great selection of patterns to choose from which made it easy for me to make my decision.Im one totally satisfied consumer!"
19432,0,I could not put it in and have it lay flat like the picture shows. I am concerned this may cause discomfort for my baby (due in thirteen days) but we will see when we begin using it.
18504,1,I used playtex disposables with my first born and now my second born is two months old and buying liners for the bottles is getting old. But I never had any problems w/ the playtex nursers. So I tried the Avent and they leaked all over my diaper bag. The Playtex Ventaire Naturalshape are okay they don't expel the air like they are supposed to. But Dr. Browns does exactly what its supposed to. There are extra parts to clean but it doesn't take up too much extra time and it comes with its own cleaning brush for the extra parts.Well worth it.
53199,1,We have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone. We just love it and so does our 6 month old!
62227,1,"~*Concept is great, just needs a little work. a little on the small side; needs more room for baby's mouth. unique and very cute, however,i wouldnt recommend for prolonged usage tho.*~"
128160,1,"Loved the idea of this stroller, and it does meet my expectations, infact I can fit my newborn in front, 3 yr old sitting on the bench (fwd facing w/ feet in basket), and my 5 yr old standing up. Glides great, easy to fold... only problem is, IT IS SO LONG, (its as long & bulky as a double stroller~no exaggeration). It is fine when all the kids are in it, but when its just me and baby, he seems WAY to far away with the huge gap, and because of its length, it is hard to manuver at times. The stroller may not appear as long when baby graduates to the front seat w/OUT the car seat. Pictures are deceiving in lenth. There is a HUGE gap between baby & mom, MUCH LONGER than photos appear."
72093,1,"The Pikachu bank is about 5 inches tall, but the blue base is the only part that holds money, so it doesn't hold very much at all. It's more for display, the base is made so that you can connect it to the other banks available in the series. It's very cute and made entirely of plastic so it's durable."
73989,1,"The Joovy Caboose is not perfect, but it is one of the best double strollers out there.Pros:1. Small footprint. It is as narrow as single stroller.2. It similar in length to a single stroller.3. The child in back can jump on and off, which is great for trips to the park or walking around the neighborhood. They can get on and off as they tire or prefer to walk.4. There is a small back seat for the older kid if they like. My older son really enjoys all the options!5. It fold up pretty nicely - very flat and no extra pieces to carry. This makes it ideal for city life where you might do a combination of walking, strolling, bus, train, etc.6. It is much easier to maneuver and push than the longer double strollers out there, such as Baby Jogger.7. Inexpensive.Cons:1. The handle is non-adjustable and is a bit too high for me (I am five feet tall).2. We don't use the tray at all - it seems like a pain, especially if you want to fold it on a regular basis.3. The basket is very small, and if a child is in the back it is fairly inaccessible. And don't think of hanging a shopping bag or diaper bag from the handle, because the kid in back will certainly get bonked!4. Even though it is fairly easy to fold, you do need two hands, which can be difficult with a small baby. And it is weighty to carry, especially if you also have to carry the little one and a diaper bag at the same time.5. Don't fool yourself - it is still a chore to push all that weight and the wheels could be smoother.Note:1. I have a four year old and a one year old.2. I can't speak to any issues with the car seat, since I didn't use that.3. We have this exact model, in orange. I have seen the purple and think it is much nicer.4. Ideally I would love it if the front seat could also be rear facing, at least when only one child is in it. Or if it could be adjusted so the baby could be in the back facing you and the bigger kid in front facing the world."
183875,1,"This set is everything you need to start out feedings with. Right now I use the spoons and the snack bowls to feed my 4 month old rice cereal. I wish they still offered the take and toss organizer, but all of these items stack well into each other so they don't take up too much space. They wash up well, and they are so cheap that if you lose one it doesn't matter."
160994,1,"I just received this diaper bag in the mail as a gift. It is more than I had anticipated it being. After reading reviews I assumed that it would be a lot smaller however it turns out that this bag is just the right size. This is my second child and I messed up the first time and had a very small diaper bag. This could actually be used as a small book bag to carry books, phone, drink and pencils and things for a college student, and it looks cool too! VERY comfortable shoulder strap and the actual shoulder pad is a little more cushioned for comfort. it seems to be well insulated and the changing pad is very nice as well. overall I feel the price that was paid for this bag was VERY reasonable considering the bag is very well made and appears worth more. 5 stars all across. I got the grey and orange and love the colors! My husband does too."
179776,2,"While it seemed like a great idea and technically it does work as claimed, you would be better off buying a smaller and/or lightweight car or booster seat.We just got back from our hawaii trip with our 16 month old son. Bought him his own plane seat and attached the TravelMate to his Britax Marathon. The initial trip into and through the airport was fine, then the problems started:1) The Marathon is admittedly big, but many are these days. It is too wide for the plane aisles so you cant just roll up to your airplane seat. Not the travelmates fault but too late to do anything at that point. I had to take my son out of the seat and lift the car seat over my head to get to our seats (of course we had other carry on luggage as well)2) Per other comments, getting the travelmate off the car seat was a royal pain, GET RID OF THE THUMB SCREWS!. HOWEVER - realized that you really dont need to take it off as the car seat fits in the airplane seat fine with the travelmate still on it (thanks for covering this in the instructions, NOT). Just ignore the fact that it pitches the kid forward so he is constantly kicking the seat in front of him.:)2a) the attachment plate makes snaking the seatbelt buckle through the seat a royal pain (as you are blocking the aisle and getting dirty looks)3)Same problem getting off the plane - seat was too wide to roll through the aisle, so had to give kid and carry-ons to wife while i hold seat over my head to get it off the plane.4) You may think you will use this as a stroller replacement but you wont. We ended up going to WalMart on the island and getting the $17.00 cosco stroller. It worked great, left it there.Repeat all above on return trip. argh.Had we known, I would have bought a smaller lightweight car seat or maybe just a good booster seat and then checked the stroller at the gate.Its enough of an adventure traveling with a child or two. While seemingly a cool idea I would pass on this piece of gear until they make substantial improvements."
3871,2,so i ordered these bottles that are shown in the picture right so you would think that you get getting what are are looking at you do in stores you should on line well when i got my package it was not what i ordered why would i spend this much money on this bottle when i can get in in store for so so much cheaper . my daughter is 3 months old and im a ful time breast feeder well i just recently went back to work havent found any bottle that hve worked a friend let me try hers out like the one shown in pictures and its the only thing she will take so i tried to get my own i had to leave work 3 days in a row tahts every day since i have been back just to feed cuz i had to reorded the bottles adn they are still not what i had ordered i talked to the ladies at amazon and now they are saying the picture is wrong . dont order these if you want square top nipples you will reciever round squar top nipples are very hard to find and you will not find them here
163633,1,I purchased this chair to have when my friend's daughter comes to visit. She has some developmental issues and eats better when she can sit up and feed herself. This chair does a good job of holding her in a position to do so. I also like that it can be used in a way that can accomodate her as she grows. I was surprised at the low price for the quality.
79050,1,"This is a really nice, sturdy table. My husband weighs 170 and he even sits in the chairs on occasion. It was very simple to put together. The only thing I regret about buying this is the slots in the chairs. My toddler is a very messy eater and food gets between these slots and is very hard to clean. The color is pretty true to the picture, just a little brighter green that you see online."
42873,1,I wear my wrap almost everyday when I have to do everyday household chores. Sometimes my daughter doesnt want to be put down and I love how the moby wrap simulates your arms when you hold your baby. This is a product that every mother with a new born or toddler should own.
1295,1,"Pampers diapers are one of the best I have tried thus far. I had tried Huggies and they weren't as great as I thought that they would be (being a new dad). The Huggies didn't fit correctly for my baby and would create problems for me. Tried to save on some Wal-Mart brand diapers and they just didn't cut it. I could tell right away that the Wal-Mart brand were ""economic"" for a reason, you get what you pay for. Last but not least, I tried a CVS brand I had bought prior to the baby being born thinking, hmmm, I will take advantage of this offer and show my wife what a great dad I will be. Well, I don't think the outcome affected what she thought of me as a dad too badly, but the CVS brand gave the baby a rash. Out of all of the diapers I have tried, Pampers has bene the best, regardless of the style/model of the Pampers diapers. I am extremely satisfied and would recommend this brand to anyone."
184697,1,I have this gate installed to keep my 11 month old daughter at bay. We installed it in a weird diagonal opening and it works great! We weren't able to screw directly into a stud (as recommended in the instructions) but we used dry wall anchors and they are holding just fine. I would suggest this product to anyone! I am considering another one for another opening we would like to close off. I hope this was helpful!
38740,1,My newborn had her first bath in this and it was awesome. It keeps the baby warm because the cushion absorbs the warm water. You just hang it up and it drips dry! It does get heavy when it soaks up the water though.
39004,1,"I ordered the Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade through Amazon.com. I LOVE this product. I knew I wanted the deluxe version, rather than the classic/compact versions, because it offered more versatility and protection. I bought it for our umbrella stroller since the canopy is standard and doesn't give maximum sun protection, especially on really bright sunny days. This product is so easy to set up and adjust. I really like the fact that it can be set to act like a larger, extended canopy... or adjusted so it covers the entire front of the stroller with a mesh opening for our son to still see through... OR pull the extra flap over the mesh to completely cover any light from entering so our son can nap. When not in use, it folds up easily and comes with a little bag to store it in. I highly recommend this product and plan to tell all my friends about it."
160370,1,My son is obsessed with Elmo so of course bath time safety these were the obvious choice. The only problem we have is they are very easy for him to pull up.
143094,1,"I love this product. They are suprisingly sturdy. I have tried the lansinoh and the medela bags and these are the easiest to use and pour out of. The measurements are a little off, but I just take the measurement off of the bottle I pump into and write it on the bag. Great product."
15430,2,"OK, so this carriage is not bad for the price but after less than 2 years the removable bassinet no longer stays in place to the point my daughter just can't use the carriage, and in general it is pretty flimsy. I am currently out on Amazon looking for a new pram to give my daughter for Christmas. That having been said, I like the fact it is navy and my daughter did have fun with it. If you are looking for a stroller that is going to last, however, this is not the one to buy. If you want one to get you through a year or so (while you determine if your child is truly going to play with a carriage)then this might be a good option.I will give Badger Baskets a thumbs up however in the customer service department. I recall our first bassinet piece had some flaw when we initially purchased it and they replaced it right away. I didn't have to send anything back. It was a completely painless process."
53981,1,"I got this mirror when my baby was one month old (he is now five months). With the infant car seat in the middle of the back seat, I placed the mirror in the middle. If you use the velcro included the mirror should stay in place. It was very nice to be able to see my baby any time to make sure he was ok. Now I have a convertible car seat placed behind the passenger seat, so I changed the location of the mirror. It works great! To people that have had problems with the mirror, they should remember all cars are not equal, little adjustments can make anything work."
84604,1,"I like these dispensers. They will be handy for formula for my infant or snacks for my toddler. The only thing that would be better is if the lids on the small openings were somehow attached to the containers then you wouldn't lose them. Other than that, they are a good product."
76670,2,"I bought this dresser thinking it was a similar style to a $1000 one that Pottery Barn Kids carries. While the look may be similar, it stops there. Firstly, this dresser does not resemble white in any way. If antique white means ivory or cream, why don't they just call it by either? The size is also diminutive. The drawers are very shallow and will not accommodate a growing child or their accumulation of wardrobe. While the outside packaging seemed secure enough, the inside revealed many damaged parts. The assembly directions have to be the worst part of this dresser. The instructions very often skipped steps or assumed you had already performed the tasks necessary to connect so and so piece together. Also, the directions fail to adequately identify which piece is which- making the assembly a tedious and frustrating endeavor and I have put together many pieces. The pros of this dresser are that it is definitely better quality than your average IKEA piece. While it is still constructed of particle wood, the parts are adequately thick making it solid enough...though certainly not comparable to Pottery Barn's furniture. Aesthetically, it is a pretty good looking dresser."
150822,0,"I've had this dresser for 2 years. It might just be me, but I've had so much trouble with the drawers. The wheels have fallen off, they get off track, and they seem somewhat shallow (especially when you have lots of bulky clothes for winter). The outside has held up really well. It did take a lot of time to put together I remember, so take the advice from the other reviewers."
126063,2,"I have never had much luck with Huggies in the past, but I thought I'd give them a try again, since I could save a bit on the Subscribe shipments.I have two little ones in diapers, a six month old (16lb) and a two and half year old (27lb). Both of my boys leak through these thin diapers in about 6 hours. Which means almost every night.I have had better luck with generic store brand diapers than these. The strength of the velcro tabs is pretty weak on these diapers too.Always try a small pack of diapers before you go buy a big box or two. I learned that lesson again."
92145,1,"This boppy wedge has saved my back(at least while I'm asleep!) during the last trimester of my pregnancy. I was having trouble getting comfortable in bed, but now I sleep just fine. Good product, fast shipping."
183521,0,"The edge is great, as it really cushions the corners. The adhesive however is not sticky enough as it started coming off already on some of the furniture. But I am still happy with the purchase. I'll just look for a better adhesive."
156567,2,"When I first purchased this swing for my second baby, I loved it. However, when he was first able to start grabbing the side bars and pull himself up I noticed that it looked as if his whole body might fall forward because of the design of the seat and the lack of shoulder straps. Since then he has actually fallen to the side twice - once facing down and once facing up - with his head hanging over the side and under the bars. I have never left him unattended in this swing so it wasn't a life-threatening problem because I was able to get him out immediately. We will never use this swing again. IT IS TOO DANGEROUS! I will be writing to Fisher Price to inform them of the potential danger this swing has. There needs to be some sort of side protection on the seat, or a shoulder strap. PLEASE THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT FOR YOUR PRICELESS BUNDLE OF JOY."
148459,1,April must have just been a bad time to buy this sheet because I just bought it a week ago and have had no problems. I washed and dried it and then put it on the mattress over a mattress pad and it fit just fine. I didn't have a struggle to put it on and it didn't rip. It is a cute design and I love it.
135314,1,I bought this pillow with our first and only and we love it! I love the harness! I don't have to worry about her falling out of it or wiggling out of it. We also have a Boppy but it isn't as soft and it doesn't have a harness. She loves this pillow and almost always falls asleep in it! it is wonderful!
10049,1,"My 21 month old son LOVES to sit on this potty seat. It is so secure on our toilet seat - doesn't move at all because it is fully adjustable.He's not quite ready to be potty trained, but every night before bath I ask him if he wants to sit on his potty and go pee-pee and every night he does. (Nothing actually happens, of course.)We had one of those free standing potty trainers, but I just couldn't imagine having to empty that thing out every time he used it.This was one of my best purchases for my toddler!"
144945,1,"I love this pacifier! I bought the red dog, too (I think that is cuter). Unfortunately I did it before my baby was born and I see now that she is not into pacifier that much (which is not bad either). She uses it occasionally before sleeping."
28809,0,"The chair was easy to put together and it looks really nice. It's comfortable enough, but the cushions are quite thin and could use some more padding. We'll probably end up putting either new cushions on or a pillow on the seat. Overall, pretty good for the price."
90464,0,"I have been using the sensitive since my son was born. I love it but since baby dry and swaddler is cheaper, I figure I try them as well. I found that the baby dry seems to be smaller than the other two. my son is now 16lb but the baby dry is already very tight. The swaddler and sensitive are fitting just fine."
153771,2,I have to agree with everyone else. This monitor is horrible!!!! I live in a busy traffic area and I am constantly listening to people's phone conversations. I even picked up a police radio once. Save your money and buy something else.
46159,1,"This mobile is very well designed, my son really loves the pictures, they are reversable so I can switch them as he gets older, the pictures face the baby unlike most mobiles."
184483,1,"I spent hours combing through baby bedding and have had my eye on this bright, modern set with animals and dots for a while. When it went on clearance, I figured I'd better get it before it was gone... I am SO glad I did! It is absolutely adorable! I am in love with it! It is high quality and the reversible bumper (large animal photos inside, colored circles w/animals on outside) has brightly colored grosgrain ribbons to secure it to crib rails. The photos of the animals are great! The skirt is a great celery green and has white piping, which you can't see in the online photos. The crib sheet is bright polka dots on white (and it looks like Dwell for Target has a similar dots fitted sheet for $10 instead of forking out $20+ for another Babylicious crib sheet). I also got the round pillows and changing pad cover, which complete this fabulous set. You will love it!"
155383,2,"The idea in theory is a good one, however all 8 of these have fallen off various tables, chairs and desks. They do not stick very well."
64857,1,I got this swing to take with me to work and so when my mom keeps my daughter she could have a swing without having a bulky full size swing. I actually like this swing better than our full size one. This swing allows my daughter to lay back and it supports her head. She loves to nap in it. It folds up great and is easy to transport. The only thing that I do not like is that the lights don't have a setting just for them and when you turn the lights/music setting on it does not last long enough to keep my daughter entertained.
13968,2,we couldn't tell any difference in the amount of gas our baby had...we tried practically every bottle available and the old fashioned plastic bottle with the plain nipple worked best.
88754,1,"What can you expect from Pampers? Great quality and they do what they are designed to do! Very happy with them. Just be careful on ordering to many, we just barely went through this 124 count order and then we moved up to the next size!"
27148,1,"If you are going to drop 6-9 bills on your stroller, then 20+ dollars for a cup holder shouldn't be a big of a deal... Buy it."
4095,2,This was not appropriate for a bed with a high mattress. It was cheap and hard to put together. Would not recommend this
84006,2,"First off let me just start by saying that this item arrived very quickly but unfortunately arrived damaged. Upon inspecting this item I also noticed that it is very poorly constructed. I can't see anyone receiving this item undamaged. It is made from pressed wood which feels almost like thick cardboard. I can't imagine anyone being able to keep this for years of use. If it didn't arrive damaged, I'm sure my son, who is 1, would have this destroyed in a few days. I would def. steer clear of this product. I liked the idea that this was microfiber instead of painted wood which was what attracted me to it in the first place. I hope I can find a similar but well-made product. Not worth the $106 that is on the price tag. More like a $25 product."
23643,0,Returned & purchased Inglesina brand. Very sturdy & easy to attach to table but too difficult to fold; couldn't do it by myself
77968,1,"This is a very cute functional highchar, but how the heck do you get the cover off to clean it??"
176196,1,Your money is worth it. Everyting you'll need to bathe your child. Recommend it to everyone. Love the cute lil ducky.
99539,2,I have been usage the Size 2 for my son and he is still breastfeeding and so his BMs are still pretty runny. These diapers were terrible!- the poop leaked straight THROUGH the diapers- not leaking out the sides- THROUGH! That meant that there was no way that he could stay clean through a BM! Which is very annoying.
4670,1,"I love Seventh Generation diapers. Since I used them my baby never, ever had a diaper rash. I love the fact that is chlorine free. I would spend every penny on them. Do you ever wonder why babies have diaper rash? Because all these big companies use bleach in diapers that releases the poisonous substance dioxin (substance that was proven to cause cancer).I would highly recommend Seventh Generation products to all moms out there."
20161,1,"I love these and the 6 oz size for my newborn, especially while I was still breastfeeding. My daughter had no problems going back and forth between bottle and breast. If the bottles are assembled correctly, the milk will not get any bubbles.I had problems with some of the slow flow nipples, the milk just wouldn't come out, but once we got passed that I was really glad I picked VentAire. It's a lot of parts to wash and keep track of, but that's a small price to pay for a gas-free baby."
119987,1,A beautiful stand for the bassinet! So glad I bought this as our baby loves sleeping in her bassinet. Plan to use this as a laundry basket when she grows out of it. Love that this is so multifunctional and looks wonderful in our home. Sturdy and sleek. Exactly what I expected from uppababy!
59413,0,"I purchased the Diaper Depot to have the basic items I need to change my daughter's diaper at the same level of the changing table. I have a traditional changing table and was tired of reaching for items on the shelf below. Well, because the furniture in my daughter's room is SLEIGH-STYLE, the end bars are wider, and the Diaper Depot is designed to hang on a thinner rail. The only way it would fit is if I put it on the side rail, which would then be in my way. It IS a well-made product and is a good concept, so I'll have to give it 3 stars to be fair. Just open the box and look at it to make sure it fits before you buy!! My solution: I found a changing table organizer at Target that hangs down off the end rail; my husband was able to bend the organizer's hooks out a little wider to fit on the table. Also, Diaper Depot does sell a dresser-style organizer if you have a dresser next to your changing table."
499,2,"The tabs on these diapers are not sticking. I loved the deal we got from Amazon, but for the entire first package in the box (there are three in one box), the sticky tabs have been terrible. We are taping them with clear tape now, but it's so hard to get the tape, rip it off, hope he doesn't wriggle off the changing table, hold the defective diaper in place and hope it sticks long enough to grab the tape and that he stays still long enough to get it taped down... then hope it's not too loose or too tight so it doesn't sag or leak or give him red, ridgy rings around his belly. I never appreciated a great diaper that works so much as I do now. To make it worse, I can't contact Amazon easily to let them know I'm unhappy, and for the little we paid for this huge box, it doesn't seem worth it to just return, pay shipping, wait for the refund... we'll just keep using tape, I guess. I'm so bummed... we've never had a problem with Pampers or Huggies before, and I felt very relieved after reading horror stories and reviews a few have written. Now we have our own horror stories after a few incidents of defective diapers being filled with poop in... areas of our house... instead of... on the baby, where it's so much easier to clean... I hope it will at least make for some funny stories, someday."
39317,2,"These cups are useless. If your toddler needs a straw cup to prevent messy drinking, he or she is likely to throw it to the ground, at which time the lid pops off and beverage goes all over the floor, or turn it upside down, so the beverage spills all over your kid, or just take the lid off, which is easy to do, and -- you guessed it -- the beverage spills everywhere. Even for just drinking water, these are useless. I'm going to buy more of the Playtex Twist and Click straw cups. Those lids stay on, and they have some mechanism in the straw to prevent all the liquid from pouring out if the cup is turned upside down."
73354,0,"I definitely used this for times in between feedings, other than that it wasn't useful. It would be great if it had a counter for each wet and soiled diapers instead of the timer. The left and right sides toggle are very useful as well!!!Update: Now at baby's 3 month mark we no longer use it at all. We're keeping it because we could see a use in the future for it..."
5890,0,"I don't like the fact that if you try and pull on the cord to raise or lower your shades, it just pops off and you have to re-attach it and wind it up every time. It does it's job but like any baby proofing item it's annoying and not easy to install."
132532,1,"This product is great! There has been a recent explosion of people having babies around me, and one kind friend told me that this is the one gift everyone has to have, even if they don't register for it at a baby shower. Being that I know nothing about wipes, warmers, or baby bums, I trusted her and bought this for 2 pregnant ladies.I've since been told that they love it and that it's invaluable for the middle of the night diaper changes. One lady is using it with regular wipes, one with cloth wipes, and both say they like it.For anyone else out there who doesn't get babies and gets the feeling of dread when you see a baby shower registry full of stuff you don't understand, buy this. My friend was right, even if the registrant didn't register for one, it's probably because she doesn't know about them, as neither of my friends did either.The babies' bums will thank you."
32059,2,"After using Avent (wide nipple) and Dr. Brown's (standard nipple), I found that Dr. Brown's smaller nipple was much better for my baby's tiny mouth. As much as I love Avent bottle's anti-gas design, the nipple was too wide at the base and milk would squirt out of the corner of my baby's mouth constantly. I switched to Dr. Brown's standard nipple which worked great, but I hated washing all those parts. I decided to try this one since the previous reviews rave about decrease in the dribbling of milk, however, this did not work for me. My baby was even messier with this nipple, making loud smacking noises while she sucked and having a constant stream of milk going down her chin, making a mess everywhere.I really wanted to like these because they are cute bottles, but they did not work for my baby."
42943,1,"I have tried many baby carriers and I love the Moby Wrap. I wish that I had bought this one first instead of wasting money on others I can no longer use. My son is 5 months old and almost 20 pounds, and this carrier did not hurt my back or shoulders after wearing him all day. Thanks for a great product!"
12195,2,"If only I had read these reviews before spending money on this breast pump! I would give it 0 stars instead of 1 star if it was possible. The motor is loud and the breast pump feels more like a torture device. My nipples have never been so sore! I bought this for use with my first baby and had no idea what breast pumps were supposed to feel like. After the pain that this machine caused me, I went and bought a [inexpensive] manual pump because I knew it wouldn't suck my nipples through the bottle! Don't waste your money like I did! I should have done a lot more research before buying this horrible pump."
52753,0,"I bought this item because a friend has one, and she said she really liked it. Once I put batteries in it and tested the musical and vibrating functions, I found that the musical function by itself doesn't work. The vibrating function and musical/vibrating function works though. My baby's not here yet to let me know if he likes it or not. But for this to be a Fisher Price item, the mechanical parts should work right out of the box. I'm happy with everything else about it."
119456,1,"The first breastfeeding pillow I got was a Boppy - I just had my first baby and all these things were new to me. All my friends had Boppys so I just assumed that was the only option. I like the Boppy, but I have back issues, and I noticed quickly that it didn't offer enough support to keep my back from becoming very tight and sore. I did a little research and found the Brest Friend and decided to try it. I wasn't excited about the price, but felt it would be worth it if it worked better for my back. I do really like it! It's very supportive for my back and I love that it holds my little one up higher so I don't have to work as hard to keep her latched comfortably. You do have to work at getting proficient with fastening it on with one hand (since most of the time I'm holding my daughter with the other) but it's do-able. And it did arrive with a very strong plasticky smell from the packaging, but I took the cover off and washed it and let the foam air out for a couple days and it went away. My only complaint is about the cover - the instructions say to let it air dry, which can be inconvenient when you exclusively breastfeed and need to use it frequently. I still use my Boppy too - both are useful in different circumstances, so I'm glad I have both."
109172,0,"I decided to purchase the bumbo tray because my baby would lean forward and end up leaning to the side in his bumbo. I thought it would be nice to be able to put toys on too. It does the job I hoped at keeping him upright in his seat. But, the toys constantly fall off the tray. I guess that is expected from a baby reaching for things. The tray is a little difficult to get on the bumbo, and frustrating when you have to take it on and off to get baby out. Overall, I would probably purchase again, as the price is not too high, and it does its job of keeping him safely in the seat."
183474,0,"When I saw this bag, I was really excited. It looked like everything I wanted. I was looking to downsize my diaper bag. I read the reviews others wrote and still thought it would be perfect. Well, I got it in the mail and it was huge- way bigger than I had expected. It was the same size as the diaper bag I have been using. I was really disappointed. It is a great bag (I actually gave it to a friend who is expecting her second and needed something bigger), but just too big. So, anyone looking for something smaller- this is not the one for you."
78367,2,"I just purchased this product and was so excited that this booster was so compact and would be easy to transport. However, when I set the product up, I wasn't very impressed. The whole design just looked too small...especially the tray. My son, who is only 11 months old, looked so uncomfortable when I put him into the booster to try it out. The tray isn't adjustable and it was firmly pressed into his tummy. Needless to say, I just purchased this product today and will be returning it tomorrow. The booster states that it is useful up to 4 years of age. My son hasn't even turned 1 and he already doesn't fit into this product. So unless your infant/toddler is very tiny, I wouldn't recommend this booster at all."
129918,1,"Yes, we bought a second base for our Graco system (which included the carseat/carrier, one base and the stroller). But, we did so, as several other reviewers have noted, for the added convenience. Just remember that your child outgrows the carseat/carrier (as a carseat) at 20 pounds. For our son that was at THREE MONTHS. Was it worth the $40 for three months? Most likely, NO, because his first three months we took him out a LOT less than we do now (when we are stuck with a standard car seat). Just remember the weight limit if you have a large baby."
27292,2,"If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can. This product is not safe at all, no matter what they call it. Get a BabeSafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby, and use only 100% cotton on top of that (between your baby and the mattress cover). Do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100% cotton blankets. Run from this product!"
178005,1,"Probably the best toy we bought for our baby so far.She started to use it from 1 month and now, 4 months later, she is still very found of it. We had to change the battery of the singing toy -a lion, but we really use the toy during this time. The lion sings 4 songs, each one lasts for about 40 seconds, I guess. The problem is that for a little baby you have to pull the lion's tail to sing, but our baby was very attracted by this toy."
64273,1,"My husband and I enjoyed casting my splendid belly as a memorable keepsake of a very joyous time. This was a very easy to use, effective product that was fairly priced and took very little time to cast. I would do it all over again!"
60638,1,"I bought a Boppy pillow for my baby before she was born. After we were discharged from the hospital following my emergency C-Section, I tried to nurse my baby girl with the Boppy. But it was too big and thick. It wouldn't fit around my plus size body that was so sore from the surgery. My baby was re-admitted to the hospital following her postpartem appointment. The lactation nurse wanted me to try to use the My Brest Fiend nursing pillow. I was afraid that it wouldn't fit around my waist. But it fit perfectly and provided a comfortable surface for my baby and I to nurse. I was able to feed my baby in various positions and it gave me a lot of support to snuggle with her after feeding. The back pillow section felt really good behind my lower back. And it will also fit my husband who is much thinner than I. I am going to buy this before my baby is discharged from the hospital."
154627,1,I have been using this wipes since my baby was born and I love them. She turned out being with very sensitive skin but she never got irritated from this wipes - even as a newborn baby.
168305,0,"I bought pampers swaddlers because I thought these were premium diapers with the color changing strips but this latest batch has a bunch of leaky diapers. I have found my baby and her crib all wet because the diaper does not seem to absorb any liquid. I have come across many diapers in which the color changing strip does not change colors even when it is full. Either the quality of these diapers has gone down or I received a defective batch. Also, my baby never had diaper rash before; the diapers in this batch are giving her a diaper rash as well. I am going to be switching to other diapers after this batch is used up."
23256,1,"The containers themselves are bulkier than I expected and pretty tall, but they organize the bags in a very clear manner, so that even my husband can grab the right bag of milk :)"
162752,1,"Snack traps are an essential for moms on the go. They are not completely spill proof but they have seriously cut down the amount of Cheerios, Goldfish, or raisins I find in the back seat of my car. They are easy for my 3 year old to get his hand in and out of and he loves the cute designs.The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is they are not entirely dishwasher friendly. The bowl part washes fine but the plastic lid turns yellow and dingy looking after being washed. I have resorted to washing them by hand which is not a big deal but just wanted to give you a heads up."
175282,1,"These bowls are great for baby food or snacks. We would use them for daycare when we needed to bring non-jar food for our daughter and now that she's older we use them for small snacks (pretzels, goldfish, etc.). We received blue, pink, purple, and orange. They're not great for letting babies/toddlers eat out of, necessarily, because they don't have a rubber bottom so they slide a bit on a table/tray, but they're great for travel. I put them in my bag all of the time and they don't spill."
94173,1,"I know that these jumpers are supposed to be dangerous for babies, but the idea seemed so cute that we registered for it anyway. I received it as a shower gift and when my daughter was finally big enough to play in it, we gave it a shot. she loves this thing. some times she just dangles, and sometimes she really gets bouncing. i use it pretty often for when i'm showering and getting ready in the morning. i hook it on the bathroom door and she's happy the whole time. lately, i've been attaching toys to the straps of the jumper for her to chew on. i gave it only four stars because it does get in the way when you want to exit/enter a room. it's not a huge deal to take it down and put it away, but it's a little awkward to store. (the straps tangle and it's generally clunky.) the places we can use this toy are also limited in our house. we have arched entry ways for most of our rooms (old house)and must resort to using it in either our walk in closet of the bathroom. if i had it to do over, i think i would get a stand alone jumper so we could use it everywhere."
62848,1,"I received this for a baby shower gift and was very excited. As keeping out odors it works great, and keeps our 60 lb. dog out of the diapers. Although I'm only giving it 4 stars because they could do a better job at letting you know when the flim is going to run out, or give you an estimate amount of diapers you will get with one fill. You always have to keep one on hand in case you run out, kind of like diapers. Plus I think they could make them in fun colors or something I think they are kind of ugly, so we purchased a diaper genie cover through kids line. It's a cloth cover that matches our barnyard bedset. As long as you read the instructions and follow them to the tee you should get along fine!"
70535,2,"I had registered for this based on its good reviews and some recommendations from other moms. I am not at all impressed with how this rocker is put together. Why would they make the toys hang with velcro? The cow in the center doesn't even face the correct way. Also, the seat is really hard. My son is bored instantly when we put him in this. We only use it if we need to put him down really quickly for something. He hates being in it."
158522,1,"Halo Sleepsacks are genius. I love that I never have to worry about my 8 month old daughter getting too cold when she sleeps. She has two of these sleep sacks in the medium size and she'll probably be able to wear them for at least a couple more months. They're roomy and allow her to move around as much as she likes. They zip up from the bottom, so nighttime changes are as easy, and they're actually made really well. I've washed these things so many times and they still look brand new. I'm more of a fan of the cotton knit sleepsacks than the fleece ones. They seem to be more durable and breathable."
165612,0,I love pampers but for some reason these ones leak all the time!I have to change my son twice a day because his diapers would leak. Switching to a different brand.
147077,1,"I purchased a roll of this wall boarder from Babies R Us on clearance and realized I didnt have enough to finish the nursery. After finding out this boarder was nowhere else in stores, I found it on Amazon. The boarder came identical to the one I bought in the store. It made my pregnant wife absolutely delighted. Happy wife, happy life! The super fast shipping was the icing on the cake!"
84592,1,"I have been very satisfied with this pump and have not had any problems with it.I am using the same one for my second daughter that I used for my first.I usually use it every day,to relieve engorgement and to be able to freeze my milk for future use.You have to make sure to wet it so it will suction on well.I always use the lowest setting and it works fine for me.I have used it while riding in the car too,thanks to the batteries.If I had to rely on a pump all the time I would probably get a double pump.For what I use it for it has been great.You get what you pay for,and I don't know why these people expect it to work as well as a $200 Medela."
181012,1,"This has been the only one of her ""toys"" that she has loved pretty much from the get go... by the time she was about 4 weeks she would last about a half hour on it, looking at the lights and listening to the music. She went from accidentally batting the animals to now, at 5 months, playing with them and laughing until she eventually falls asleep all tuckered out :) I am going to buy a second one for her to have at her babysitter's house. Absolutely LOVE this!!"
68705,1,"I like the scent of these wipes, it's a nice, soft scent. The wipes are thick and strong, and they clean up butts and faces equally well. :)"
56091,2,Part of the hardward was missing from the product we purchased. We were not able to put up the gate for weeks.
23691,0,"This chair is mostly great. It really saves space in our tiny apartment, and is really convenient. I like to look so much better than a big plastic highchair, too.However, a few glitches make it less-than-perfect: The on-line description of the product says it fits any table with up to a 6"" thickness. Inside the package, though, it says 4"". The hooks underneath do not fit around the support under our old drop-leaf table, so the chair only fits on the actual folding leaf. I hope this doesn't cause damage to the table as our daughter gets heavier. Also, the quick release mechanism for the clamp on one side stopped working soon after we started using the chair, so it requires a bit of fussing to get the chair on and off the table. The last thing is that the texture of the fabric means that you can't just wipe off sticky foods- they get ground in. Fortunately, it is easy enough to just throw the cover in the wash, but it would need to be washed less if the fabric were easier to wipe down."
2971,1,"My mother's a lactation consultant and bought this for me. I was having major problems breastfeeding and this was wonderful. My daughter and I had to use the football hold for the first two months or so and this was an absolute lifesaver. Now that she's bigger and we've advanced to the traditional breastfeeding position, we don't use it for nursing. But it's great to prop her in and let her see what's going on. It's a nice alternative to her swing. And the fleece cover is so soft and comfy. As a sign that she'd outgrown her diapers, one of her poops leaked out onto the cover and the pillow. Both the cover and the pillow washed great in the washer & dryer. The Boppy is great!"
114768,1,I received this booster seat as a shower gift. I didn't register for it but the person who gave it to me said it was a must have! She was so right! I use this seat more than I ever used my $200 highchair!!! Highchairs take up too much space and are hard to clean. This seat is super easy to clean and takes up barely any space. I love it and am buying another one now for the arrival of baby number 2. :-) Save your highchair money and just buy this item.
28606,0,"I picked this glider out for my in-laws to buy as a gift. It is comfortable, but it is much smaller than I thought. I don't consider myself a big person but I am about 5'8"" and my husband is 6'8"" and the seat doesn't come to the back of my knees and the back doesn't come up very high (about the bottom of my neck). I guess I thought the back would be much bigger and higher from the looks of the picture and is not comfortable for him at all. It's not too bad for me, but I feel like I'm sitting in a large child's seat. Anyone else feel this way?"
22872,2,"Our DD hated this product. It nearly suffocated her, and caused what we think is painful bending in the neck and spine. She still hates it at 4 months, but loves the Baby Bjorn.I think it will be more useful when she is 6-9 months old, but I see no reason to kill your back with this when the Bjorn works so well."
140994,1,i bought this for a gift for someone who was surprised by the sex of their baby. room looks amazing for boy or girl.
165094,1,"i love these diapers, also they are at a great price. they leak at night sometimes if the baby pees tons of times, which is very normal."
18551,2,"After talking to my daughter who had tried everything she knew to do about baby's gas, I looked online for some solution she had not tried yet. Dr. Brown's had amazing reviews so I ordered 2 3-packs for baby grandaughter. They didn't seem to have any effect at all. I am glad they have been helpful for some of you, tho. It's a very difficult time for moms...long days, longer nights, little sleep. Oh, how I wish Dr. Brown's had been her solution. Best wishes!"
70400,2,I've just ordered Huggies since it was cheaper on [...] after using Pampers til now. BIG MISTAKE! One out of 3 diapers my 1 year old poops in leaks (29inches 21 pounds)! Not even a minute after I smell the poop I go to change him and I see poop leaking down his legs on to the his pants and up his shirt and it becomes a nightmare. A brand such as Huggies should be more durable but I was disappointed. I am going back to Pampers.
107346,1,"I have had my diaper champ for over 5 months now, and so far, it is great at keeping stinky odors at bay. We'll see how it holds up when baby starts on solids, but thus far I love it. It's so easy to use and change, more than the Diaper Genies appear to be."
107050,1,"We owned a diaper genie for our daughter, who's now almost 3.It was the ""new and improved"" version, and if it was improved, the older model may as well been a plastic bag! It was difficult to use, costly, wasted bags, and SMELLED... With the twins, we knew we would change systems.The Champ was the option we were hoping would work, no refills to waste your money on, and it would hopefully contain smells better.DISPOSING A DIAPER* You change baby, and than wrap the diaper up with the tape attached, so it doesn't get caught on anything (we also place the dirty wipes into the ""diaper ball"")* Open the champ and place the diaper in correctly. We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.* Than you close it, and the diaper should ""plop"" into the base, and its disposed of!The Genie was much more difficult. You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS* Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag* Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag* Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...* Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.* We like to place a deodorizer in the bottom as well* Place your bag inside (we like to use lilac scented bags, cheap store bought brand) and place the top back on.Again this is MUCH easier than the slicing, tying, and bagging needed with a diaper genie, and a much faster process.******We found with the really stinky diapers, that its best to dispose of them outside, or roll them into their own bag (used grocery bags are fine) and maybe spray some Lysol into the bin every disposal or so. IF THE PAIL BEGINS TO SMELL, CHANGE THE BAG AND WASH IT OUT! Also when diapers begin to get jammed, just change the bag and your problem will be solved!******So far (and yes, the boys DID start solids) the Champ contains the smell. We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well. Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best ""diaper solution"" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!) but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well. I can guarantee if you just want to plop diapers in, and change the bag without any work, you will be disappointed... Its better than garbage pails, and much safer (too hard for kids to get diapers out). We love the Champ, and will defiantly be keeping it around!"
146780,0,"I want to really give these a 5 star rating, but I just cant do it :(pros:-these are amazingly soft and they leave my babies skin so smooth and silky afterwards, I love using them for a pee diaper-the packaging is really well made and its a breeze to grab the soft pack on the go and use it functionally-they can hang around for moths without drying out. Ive had a pack in my car that has been around as an emergency pack for over 3 months and when I grab one they are still just as wet as the day I bought themcons:-they are really thin and this is where I have an issue.if my son has a number in his diaper, I go through about twice as much wipes not to get any on my hand. they are very thin. If they were not so thin I would gladly up my rating, but lets face it, babies poop and when im out in the world the last place i want a mess is on my hands. I use far less of other brands to clean up ""spills""-they are priceyI will continue to buy these as a backup brand for my car because I like the packaging and the product in general. these however are not what I have stocked in my nursery as they do not fulfill all of my functions"
47828,1,"First of all, this gate was very easy to install. It took my husband about 15 minutes. That alone was a major plus. (We'd already bought separately and installed the Kidco banister kit since one side of the gate would otherwise have had to be drilled into the banister. If you haven't done this and need to, it will add extra time). We installed the gate at the top of the stairs using the hardware method, not the pressure method. Everything was pretty straightforward, although as others have said, we had to use different screws than the ones that came with the kit. In our case the screws were too long, though.Opening and closing the gate is a breeze...for the adults. You can easily slide the button on the top and lift the handle with one hand and very little effort, and it snaps back down to the locked position just as easily. No yanking on it, no jamming your thumbs, no leaning into it to close it like with many other gates. My only reservation about the opening/closing mechanism is that my 5 and 6 year olds haven't managed to learn to open it yet. The thumb sliding part is too hard for their little fingers thus far. That means I'm having to open and close the gate for them all day long since their rooms are downstairs. Hopefully they'll get the hang of it soon (we've only had it up a few days) or that's going to get very annoying very fast. However, if you have a toddler you're using the gate for, that's good news, right? I doubt any toddler could manage to open this gate.The gate swings open both ways, which is nice when company comes or the kids have playdates and there is a lot of traffic up and down the stairs--we can swing it all the way back against the banister and it's completely out of the way.I didn't know if I would like the clear plastic instead of bars, but it actually has a better aesthetic to it-less like a jail in your living room. I'm not sure how it'll look once it's all finger printed up. Our baby is just barely beginning to crawl and isn't that interested in the gate yet.The gate does feel sturdy, and I don't worry about her putting pressure on it or leaning on it. (Again, we installed the hardware and are not just relying on pressure to keep it in place). But there is a problem with the gate lining up to both the top and bottom latches properly. Although we used a level to install both female parts exactly plumb, the bottom male end doesn't line up to its female latch unless we push it forward with our feet as we're closing it. It still feels very sturdy even with only the top latch in place, but as the baby gets older and heavier this will be more of an issue and we'll have to make sure our older kids get both parts in place. Not sure why they're not lining up right. It's as if the gate is slightly bowed or something.My last comment is that it's nice that the gate comes with a few plastic pieces that work sort of like a shim--if you have walls that are not straight up and down or if you have molding at the bottom that would make the two female hardware pieces not even, the little oval shims can be installed under the female latch parts to line the top and bottom up exactly. (Unfortnately, we didn't realize it came with these until after my husband had cut exactly such a piece out of wood with a ban saw! Oh well.)Overall, I'd give this gate a very high rating, with my only reasons for 4 stars being that my bigger children can't open the gate and that the bottom male end doesn't line up right with the female end unless we maneuver it into place with our feet. But I do feel it's a sturdy, well-made gate and was very easy to install. Most importantly, it's very easy for me to open and close without force or injury, which I can't say about very many other gates I've seen or owned."
9335,1,Our daughter loves using this chair. It is stable and very easy to clean.
40326,1,"I don't use any other diapers for my boys but these. No leaks! From swaddlers, to cruisers, to pull ups, they're the best."
126734,2,I have been trying different diapers for my son since he was born and is now currently 11 months old. These are by far the WORST diapers I have ever used. After the first couple of diapers leaked through I decided to take a poll on 10 diapers. 8 out of 10 leaked. Don't waste your money...
24515,1,"Kids can't open this even if you have two five year olds on both sides trying. It is for operated so hands are free. It is very easy for an adult to open. Had a couple of children decide it was a swing and because they were bigger kids they broke hing of gate and I immediately ordered another one, have a child care and would not be without this product."
116245,1,"These disposable placemats are fantastic for little ones -- at home or at a restaurant. Many other parents have seen me using them and have come up to me asking where they could get them. Not only do they provide a clean eating surface and eliminate the need for carrying around plates or bowls in the diaper bag, but feisty toddlers can't pick up the placemat and throw it on the floor. They fold up easily in the diaper bag -- I always keep them with me."
17446,1,my daughter loves this. shes is 3 months old.the only problem i had is the plastic poles come undone. you really have to slam them in there good. other then that i love it. i paid like $10 less for mine at babycatalog. com they have a lot of stuff cheaper
182958,1,I've had this latch on my refrigerator for several months and haven't noticed any of the weakening some of the other reviews mentioned. It works great for keeping the dogs out (our main reason for buying it) and I'm sure it will keep our newborn child out until she's a year or two old and figures out the trick.
115175,0,"We tried to find a metal gate that pressure mounted for the bottom of our stairs. We found this gate but it didn't work for us. It comes with 2 attachments- a narrow one and a wide one- you can use one or both. Our space was 37 1/2 inches wide, but neither attachment worked. The narrow one was too narrow (we made it as tight as we could, but the gate still wiggled back and forth), and the wide one was too wide. So it does not fit all spaces. Plus it was too tall to attach to our 30 inch tall bannister. We tried putting plywood up against the banister and readjusting the handrail...but nothing worked. We had to return it."
120631,1,"My Dr suggested wearing one of these, this specific kind to-that crosses across your chest when I complained in my 22 week appointment that I was have tons of lower back pain that never improved, and by the end of the day my stomach area felt tight and painful. Because of my weight, I have some extra baggage below my belly so I shared his feeling that I needed some extra support.I got this size, and it's wonderful. I wish they came with instructions because the best way I can figure to put it on is to put it over my head then pull it down. I'm not sure how effective this will be as I progress through my pregnancy. And I'm not sure about washing, but I guess I'll just launder the same way I would delicates.The straps have no adjustments, no closures, and are actualy quite confortable. I've worn it under my bra to control the shoulder straps (bra straps holding the cradle's straps in place) so I could wear lower cut shirts and over bra as well for higher collar/neckline shirts and both work fine.Mort importantly my back doesn't hurt and my stomach feels so much better. I noticed that I'm generally holding myself in a more relaxed muscular state too so I'm sure that I was mentally compensating for the need for some support and that this will be much better for myself and my baby."
149302,0,"Well I needed a body pillow because my hips have been hurting since early in my pregnancy. After reading reviews I decided upon this one.I like it, but after about a week of use, my neck was killing me. The pillow is so thick it really doesn't work for a head pillow. However, my husband suggested I flip it around (the ""U"" piece at the bottom rather than under my head) and then I can still use it for my hips. That worked out well; I am back to my Tempur Pedic neck pillow which is far more comfortable.It *does* take up a lot of room in the bed though."
158306,1,This is a GREAT Trina Turk dress and is everything you would expect! It fits very true to size. The fabric is wonderful and it is fully lined.
21838,1,"Mustela Hydra-Bebe Body LotionSilky skin, gentle to baby, and the most scrumptuous scent ever: This lotion goes on quite greasy at first, but use only a small amount for less oiliness. It's a hydrating lotion quite popular in Europe and the Orient. Exceptional gift for those of discerning tastes."
128689,2,"I ordered 3 different kinds of these and all said they were BPA Free (or 0% BPA) in the description and when they arrived the other two boldly stated in a bright green circle that they did not contain BPA, except this one. I know they made some before the BPA thing became popular so they may be trying to dump their inventory. I returned it just to be safe(r)."
81782,1,"I have a changing table made of wood and bought this changing pad. It's affordable, soft, safe, and it stays on place. You have to put screws on the back of the changing table, but it was easy to do, and the material on the bottom really does adheres to the surface to prevent sliding, without damaging the wood. It's really soft and comfortable.I also boughtBasic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Sagefor covering and it's really soft and fits great."
134871,2,"We bought the snugRide infant car seat but it was already too small when our son turned one month (he was approx. 10.5 lbs). As he is a winter child, when we dress him up in a snowsuit, the straps no longer buckle up. We were forced to put the straps over his shoulders only, which was obviously not safe. If your child is above average weight and you are planning to use the car seat over winter months, consider getting a convertible car seat right away. One more thing ... the car seat is VERY HEAVY, especially with a 10+ lbs newborn."
5194,1,"Great diaper! 7th Generation makes a great other option when trying to decide about diapers. No chlorine helps the environment and your baby's sensitive skin. And the sides are tight with the inner and outer elastic- no problems with leaks. We've been really happy. Amazon gives good prices too, especially with delivery discount."
83482,1,I love this pack and my son loves riding in it. It has an adjustable zipper at the bottom so as my baby gets bigger he can have more room. Also very comfortable to wear and easy to get on and off. I use this all the time while shopping.
136718,0,"My daughter has enjoyed this toy so far. The volume is very low - you can turn it up, but it resets itself down when it shuts off. So when my daughter turns it on for herself (she's figured out how to kick it in the middle of the night to get it to play), it's back to very quiet. But it is very cute and we've enjoyed it. It helps put her to sleep at nap time."
14623,0,"I read reviews on these bottles that indicated that they leak. I went against my gut feeling and purchased them for my newborn son. He is only one month old and I am regularly having problems with leaks. I have found that if the bottles are even the least little bit wet from cleaning they will not seal. Even after hand drying I have still had instances where I couldn't get them to seal. My son feeds well from them; much better than from the Gerber straight bottles, but dealing with the leaks has been very frustrating."
181987,1,I orginally bought this urinal for my four year old who has some trouble hitting the big boy potty. 1 hour after we had it my 17 month old was already using it. It is amazing.
164206,0,"I ordered size 4 baby dry. But it was the old baby dry that doesn't have the flexible tabs. when I ordered it the page showed the diaper box with the flexible tabs feature. However, I got the old baby dry diaper without flexible tabs which is a little bit too tight for my baby."
72930,1,I love this little seat! It is perfect for moving around and storing since it fold up. It works perfectly for a family who doesn't have a lot of extra space. We have had no problems with it and have enjoyed using it.
4441,0,"Overall, this was a good bathtub for us and served its purpose until our daughter was a little over 7 months old and outgrew it. HOWEVER ... I want to warn everyone interested in this tub that the ducky begins to take on that ""wet-sponge"" smell very quickly in spite of regular machine washings and hanging it to dry immediately after bathing (at least ours did). The tub without the ducky is pretty slippery, so I would recommend buying a non-slip mat to put in the tub instead of the ducky. You can always use the non-slip mat again when your baby transitions to the big tub."
102831,2,"This diaper pail should be pulled off the shelves! I have to contend with &quot;2&quot; of these stink trappers! I was so dissapointed at how they do not cover the odor. Sure they take trash bags, but it's a real task to change because the lid never stays open.I'm on the hunt for a better diaper pail, anyone have any suggestions???Until then I'll keep the &quot;clothespins&quot; nearby :-)"
4490,1,"I bought this product because it looked fun and easy to move around. The reviews I'd read were favorable so I thought it would be fun to try out a different kind of jumper that allowed for freer movement. My son loves it. He could jump around in it for about 30 minutes and gets quite a work-out! He's six months old but will be using this for awhile. At the beginning, he just kind of stood there in and and twisted around to look at things. Part of what I think he likes about it is that he feels like he's standing completely on his own.It's hilarious to watch him bounce and he enjoys every minute.The only downside is getting used to strapping him in. It takes a few times to get the hang of it but is worth it and I'd recommend this product to anyone. We also found that while the stand takes up a bit of space while in use, it takes 30 seconds to set up and 30 seconds to take down so leaning it behind a dresser or something when we don't want it out is an even better perk."
29976,1,"Excellent deal, quality bedding at a very good price. I am very pleased withmy purchase."
174926,1,"this item is very useful for baby bathing, my son loved it... he can sit inside without any support when compared to regular bath for kids."
173907,0,"Mmy only dislike is that there isn't much difference between speeds. Otherwise, I really like it."
36627,1,"I just had my first baby so I don't have a lot of experience with different car seats, but I must say I have loved the last 6 months with this one. It is heavy, but it's a good work out if you're not lazy. Putting my baby in the car using the base and taking her out couldn't be easier.The handle does stick a little in the beginning, but it gets easier once you get the hang of it. In fact I don't think I have had any problems with it after the 2nd day.I read one person's comments about black fibers coming off the seat and ruining the clothes, I never had any problems like that. When I took the seat out of the packaging, there where some little black fuzz balls, but I used the vacuum and never had any continuing problems or messes.My little girl was born weighting 6lbs and 5oz and 19in. Now she is 14lbs and 26in. From beginning to end she has fit perfectly in the seat even for being a long baby. She loves it! It is snug but not tight. It is almost as good as swaddling her.I searched long and hard for the best and safest seat possible before she was born, and I believe I found it! If you have problem with the seat belts, or have problems positioning your baby in the seat, maybe you are doing something wrong. And you also have to take into consideration that all babies are built differently!If my daughter could talk I am sure she would let you know that this is the best seat out there!"
112571,1,"I feel like a fool because I told all of the moms I know to get their diapers from Amazon because it was such a great deal. Then I found out they had raised the price three whole dollars between the time I bought diapers and the time my friends went to buy them. Now I look like I don't know what I am talking about.On the other hand, I really like the product. I will warn you that the sizes seem to be a bit off to me. I've been using size 3 since my daughter was about 13 pounds. The size 2s were much too small by that point. So count on them running a little small."
32005,1,"This is the best highchair ever! Everyone who sees it goes on and on. My daughter loves it. She not only eats at the table in it, we also make it into the desk and chair so she can color. My little newhews come over and use the chair to watch their movies. The high chair is always in use at our house, and still looks brand new. It's super easy to clean. The only problem with this high chair is the fight over who gets to sit in it."
175019,1,"My daughter was vlning out of her baby tub and 6 months. She loves this tub, just enough space for her to sit up and kick. The age specifies until2 yrs but there is no way a 2 year old could fit in it!"
100339,0,"We've been using these diapers a little over a year. I would say Pampers used to be the best diapers on the market but not now. The quality is dropping. They do not hold overnight and now, they very offten just tear apart. Very dissapointed as the price is going up when the quality is going down. Something is not right."
123545,1,I THINK THAT THIS PRODUCT IS VERY COLORFUL AND STANDS OUT FROM THE REST OF THE PLAY YARDS. KIDS LOVE BRIGHT COLORS AND I THINK THEY'LL LOVE BEING IN THIS PLAY YARD.
33553,1,"This is a great pressure gate. We got it to temporarily block the entrance between two rooms as our new kittens were getting used to the other cats in the house. It is a little tricky to figure out at first, but it is wonderfully sturdy and adaptable for such a great price. Just read the directions carefully and you will get the hang of it soon."
176439,2,It is soooo noisy... Invest in an Avent ISIS or Medela Pump in Style.
172288,2,"We have had this bath seat for a few months now (since my son grew out of his baby bath-tub), and I really didn't have too many problems until tonight! My husband was giving my son a bath, and when he was about to lift him out to dry him off he took one of his legs, bent it, and moved it the three-inches it takes to stick it through the back whole. He sat there in the practically the split position yelping in pain as he proceeded to try to remove from that uncomfortable position. I ran into the bathroom to see what all the crying was for and had to help my husband tear the seat to pieces in order to get my baby out. His leg is very bruised up and the seat is now in shambles!Let me just say that this seat is definitely not safe. I thought this would be a good buy but was terribly wrong! Think long in hard before you buy this - because you'd be putting your child in jeopardy! Were calling Safety 1st first thing tomorrow to tell them our story..."
130895,0,"I loved this swing when we first got it when my son was born. He Loved it too, the way it would go from cradle to regular swing was neet,and he loved to stare at the sea creature mobile and the sounds where nice too. It seemed to swing too fast on high, but it is ajustable. I did notice as the weeks went by the swing wasn't working so great as in the beginning. The motor got very loud and the music would start to sound funny. The mobile was loud too. It wasn't so easy to recline eather.I definantly went threw a lot of D batteries too. Now I am due for my second baby and the swing dosn't work at all! The motor makes a terrible noise and the swing dosn't swing. I don't recomend this swing if you plan on using it for long, and especially for a second time around!"
36070,0,"I bought these cups for my youngest son to help transition him off of the Avent sippy cups he had been using. I thought these cups would make the transition to a regular cup easier since the spout was larger and there weren't any valves to restrict juice flow.I have to say that when I first bought these cups, I loved them. So much so, in fact, that I went out a bought a few more sets; big ones, little ones, princess ones, Lightning McQueen. I loved them, the kids loved them, the price was great, everyone was happy... until the lids started cracking. In less than a few weeks time, every single lid, over 20 in all, began to crack right at the spout.I know that these cups are marketed as ""take and toss"", but if you read the full description, the manufacturer clearly states that they are durable enough to reuse over and over. Now, as far as sippy cups go, these cups are priced very reasonably if you intend to reuse them. As far as disposable cups go, I cannot justify spending $1 per cup for something intended to be thrown away.I tried to give the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt on this one and contacted their parent assistance center, but I literally hit a brick wall. The representative advised me that if I wanted a cup I could reuse, I should consider purchasing a more expensive cup. So, for any parent out there looking for a cup to use and throw away, you will absolutely love these. For the more frugal parents out there, let the buyer beware because these cups are anything but durable."
143959,1,I found I had to have two of these for my bannister dimensions. Also nice for eliminating the holes in your wood or easy removal for dressing up the house. Excellent quality and rugged.
45691,1,This is a great product with good quality. My baby loves it. I would recommend it to others. Every part of it is designed to stimulate your child.
132019,1,"Purchased this and the spiderman wall cling graphics. What a great room. My grandsons love it! I purchased brick background wallpaper to go behind Spidey. Even though it says it can't go on wallpaer, it did, it does, and it hasn't peeled or curled yet, after 5 months. Looks just like Spidey stuck on the wall. Huge size and easy to put together. It comes in pieces so it's easy to work with, and the price can't be beat! Looked at those Fathead Spiderman graphics and this is just as large, great color and really inexpensive. I'm the best Grandma ever! Just ask them. LOL"
148157,0,"We just received this bouncer today for our 10 week old. This is the third bouncer we have tried and this is the only one that the baby has liked. The light-up waterfall captures her attention and the hanging toys are low enough that she can grab and play with them. She smiles and laughs in the seat. She also enjoys the strong vibration. I am giving this bouncer only three stars because like many other reviewers said, the toy bar started malfunctioning almost immediately. The two animals at the top of the toy bar which should go up and down stopped moving within 5 minutes of use. Luckily, Amazon makes returns incredibly easy and are sending a replacement now."
115873,1,"traveling with it was easy, is not heavy, easy to store in its bag, very comfortable even on stone streets."
69993,1,"We have used this monitor for 13 months and have had only positive experiences with it. This is a highly sensitive monitor that picks up everything (even noises from rooms adjacent to baby's room!). We run a humidifier in baby's room and definitely pick up some background noise from it. However, we can also hear our baby's tinyest whimpers and sighs. It is reassuring to us that we can hear all the myriad of sounds that our monitor picks up. We know that we are kept abreast of what is going on not only in baby's room, but in several rooms near hers as well. We have a cordless phone in the same room as the reciever and have had no interference. After 13 months of nightly and naptime use, it's still working great! A definite 5 stars!"
29577,1,I got this mobile when my daughter was 3 months old because I had not bought one when she was born. She needed some entertainment in her crib. It looked like she was bored. The mobile came in and she was mesmorized. I am so glad I bought this for her. It has really become a life saver.
142093,0,"this is the only brand of sunscreen my baby can use, but unfortunately it's not what i ordered...!i ordered the blue lizard baby, but received blue lizard sensitive. we were leaving on vacation the next day, so i had to use it, as i can't find it in stores here.the tag on the back of the container even said blue lizard baby...just labeled and shipped the wrong product! luckily, he didn't have a reaction to it, so it worked out fine...just need more attention to detail!"
110486,1,"These locks took some time to install, however when you follow the instructions it goes very smoothly. The time now was well worth the ease in the future. Plus, after my daughter has outgrown the need for cabinet locks I can put them in their inactive mode. This is great because when we have future company we can reactivate them and the home is childproof again. Just be careful on cheap cabinets because you can drill through the entire door! Definitely a wonderful investment."
158434,1,"I did a ton of research trying to find the right cup to start my little boy on. He has never taken a bottle, so he didn't respond well to the softer tipped sippy cups. We also didn't want him to get hooked on a certain type of cup that we'd have to wean him off of later. These are perfect because they are hard tipped like a real cup edge and he doesn't have to suck to get anything out of it, so he's getting used to the way you drink out of a regular cup. They are not spill proof, but we found that any that are spill proof are basically just a bottle anyway. And now at 14 months, he has actually learned to set the cup upright so it won't spill. The lids snap on super tight, it's high quality, durable plastic and easy to clean. My 2 and 4 year old nieces use these too, so they work for many ages. We have already ordered two sets and will order more as needed through the years!"
145160,1,"This product is exactly what we wanted! The thing I love about it the most is that it doesn't just play music. It reacts to how the baby is moving. Every time he jumps it makes a noise or each toy he plays with causes some sort of reaction.Baby loves it and we love it. I went back and forth between this one and the Luv-U-Zoo and based on reviews, decided on this one. LOVE IT!"
1261,1,"We have used Huggies Diapers for Our Son. Had No problem with them so started using them for our second child also. But one day when my husband went to store to get a new box of Huggies Diapers, he had to lift the Pampers box of Diapers so has to reach the Huggies diapers to his Surprise what does he find; that the Pampers box of diapers is much lighter than the Huggies Box of Diapers not believing he checked the diaper count, both had the same number then he cross checked the boxes weight (by lifting the boxes) again then brought home the Pampers Box so from then onward we are using Pampers Diapers and ya though the pampers diapers are lighter they can hold in the same amount of capacity."
141796,0,"So far so good on the thin rail of our crib. I had to attach cloth diaper covers to the end of each rail so that my daughter doesn't peel it off with her teeth. We tried this thin one on our side rails but they are too wide and I've ordered the extra wide gummi crib rail cover. It does work if the crib rail is the right size, the challenge is keeping the baby from peeling it up on the edges...At least we have extra cloth diaper covers that we've snapped overtop of the ends. So until she also figures out how to remove those it works just fine."
91407,1,"This is the 3rd monitor we purchased. The previous 2 were much more expensive. But we've found that because a lot of the cordless phones are 900 MHz now, they interfere with the baby monitors that are 900 MHz. Our reception is very clear. We love that there are two receivers so we can keep one upstairs and one downstairs. Also, the lights are a big bonus. Sometimes when I'm not sure if I heard the monitor because I'm far away from it, I can still see the lights. Not sure why some reviewers would complain about hearing traffic and such on the monitor. If you have a monitor that is sensitive enough to hear your baby breathing, then of course you're also going to pick up any background noise. I'm happy to have a monitor that is that sensitive. I think that's a good thing. Believe me, if the baby is screaming I don't need a monitor to hear her."
106274,2,"I nannied for two babies in some one else's home and they have the Diaper Champ. I think the reason parents don't smell the diapers when using this product is because they get used to the smell!! I would think that the poopy diapers were fine in this diaper pail until the parents would come home and ask why it smelled so bad in their house! Finally, I had to start using the ""champ"" for wet diapers only and walk the poopy diapers out to the street garbage can. Although I'm sure that this is better than throwing the diapers in your house garbage, there has to be something with some better odor control!"
71008,2,"Just wanted to add another cautionary post here about your baby tipping over. My 7 mo. old was within a second of face planting as she reached for a dropped toy--I luckily looked over and caught the chair right before she smashed into the hardwood floor. It's kind of disappointing since I think of Fisher Price as a gold standard in child product safety, we grew up with Fisher Price products ourselves. Some other people have written here not to use the chair in rocking mode with infants of this age, but this isn't really made obvious, and I naively thought that since the product says 'safe up to 40-lb. toddlers', it was engineered to not tip over. It's not a bad product overall, but this is something that anyone who uses this chair should be aware of."
84426,0,The ropes were not the same length so we had to adjust the chains that we attached it to to make it level.It is a good product but nothing to be excited about.
33515,0,"This gate is used to keep our dogs in the kitchen. In the process, we humans have to step over it each and every time we travel back and forth to the kitchen. It works for this purpose and is low enough to not need a pole vault and high enough that the dogs do not want to jump over. I do notice that every few days I have to set the gate back up because it has fallen, but I have not pinpointed whether this is the gate's fault or somebody in the household (4 teenagers, 2 adults). Either way, the gate is positioned between two walls with no trim, and when I set it up, it feels like it has a solid hold and when I pick it up from the floor, the lock is still set. Because I can't figure out why it keeps falling, I would not recommend it for a toddler or stairway."
107519,1,"Nice product, well made. The velcro close tab at the top is a little annoying as it does not always stay closed and it hits my baby in the chin."
88691,1,"Great Price, Great Product. Can't find this big box in stores. Glad to find it on Amazon. I have bought all my daughters diapers on Amazon and will continue to until she is potty trained."
12834,2,"I didn't by this deluxe gift set, but I did buy just the Prenatal Listener (without all the extras). I guess I bought it when I was about 5 months pregnant. I had already heard the heartbeat by then, but thought this would be fun to have at home between visits. Well, in the 4 weeks that this product worked, the only sounds I really heard were the clicking of the unit on and off and occasional rumbling of my stomach. I was hoping it was still just early and that maybe later in my pregnancy I would have better luck hearing the baby. Well, after having it for only a month, the product stopped working all together. Now when I turn it on, I hear nothing at all. I didn't save the packaging or my receipt after using it because, as a firsttime parent, I was keeping my hopes up that eventually it would work as promised. What a mistake; I should have just returned it in the beginning and saved the money I spent on it. I think it's a lovely idea, but the product just doesn't work."
145068,0,My baby LOVES LOVES LOVES this jumper. She has been using from 6 months old to 10 months old. She jumps and bounces all around - loves chewing on the chew toy the most so my only change would be to get a jumper with more toys that can be chewed on. The problem is after 4 months of use one of the springs broke!! It's covered so baby couldn't be injured and I called fisher price and they arranged for me to send back the broken pole and would send me a refund check. The problem is the whole process to get the check back take 6 weeks!! YIKES!! Who wants to wait that long for a replacement toy that works!
79860,0,So I bought this to protect my TP from my cat because she would unroll the roll any chance she got. This product helped on that but it became a gateway for her to scratch the TP off since she could not unroll it... An even worse habit. DO NOT USE FOR CAT!
153538,1,I really like this bag its such a fun color and cute design.I only have one baby so it works for me. I think if i had more kids I would need a bigger bag but its perfect for just one.:) and the strap is a good size and good length. I recommend this bag to any new mom!
80933,1,"This was one of those items on my registry that people told me I didn't need or wouldn't use. That was wrong. I use it all the time!Pros:* The pillows on the sides are wonderful. I don't have to worry about my baby toppling over when I make a turn! She can also curl up and get comfy if she's tired.* The part that wraps around the handle is good to keep her from sucking on the handle, but it also protects me from those grocery store germs too!* The straps for the toys are a great idea so her toys don't end up on the floor* It easily folds up into itself to make it easy to carry* It's easy to set up on the cart with a baby in your arms* It has its own adjustable belt strap - you don't have to use the gross ones in the cart* It covers the WHOLE seat of the cart. There were a number of covers that I looked at that only covered part of the seat - what's the point?Cons:* It is a little small for some carts, but that hasn't stopped me from using it. The worst that happens is the back part won't go all the way over the back of the seat, which doesn't affect my daughter at all - it just means I can't use the pockets on the back.* You'll want to go shopping more often once you have this, which will make you spend more $$ ( :) )"
176282,2,"I got these for my baby shower. I had read the reviews on these beforehand and was not impressed from the beginning, but I figured that for free they were worth a shot. INCORRECT! Thankfully, my daughter is too small for ANY cloth diapers so far, because if I had used these I would have to change her every 5 minutes (including her clothes). I used them as a pad to keep under her head in the crib so I wouldn't have to change the sheet every time she spit up, and I still do because it takes about 10 minutes to soak through the padded part, and 10 milliseconds to soak through the outer part (which is see-through because it is so thin). However, I did give them two stars instead of one because I feel that they would probably make great dust rags. Just keep them away from anything wet!"
153824,1,"These wipes are great. They are thin, but not delicate. I can trust the brand. You won't be disappointed. Give 'em a shot!"
31563,2,"this thing is so poorly designed--it never really felt like it was completely snapped in even though there was nothing else to do. after 9 months of use, the top rack would collapse on the bottom one if it was just breathed on. the whole thing falls over too really easily too b/c its center of gravity is too high."
30710,0,"Very disappointed....way over priced. Could not turn the volume up because the static was overwhelming. I tried them in different areas of the house and nothing changed. Go for the digital units. Same money but a big, big improvement."
160028,0,"This blanket is a nice solution for those who can't get the hang of traditional swaddling. The fleece is too warm for warmer weather, but it is wonderfuul for cool nights. I agree with the other reviewer who says it is hard to find the larger size and recommend the Miracle Blanket (found on the site with the same name). It is great for bigger and stronger babies."
117856,1,"We bought this table for our 2 year old daughter for her play room and it is a perfect fit. The table, benches and storage bin were very easy to put together, my husband and I had it together in less than an hour, even with our daughter 'helping.' The table is very sturdy as are the benches and the bin rolls very easily even on carpet. The bin is pretty spacious and can hold quite a lot, we have coloring books, crayons, puzzles and some other toys with plenty of room to spare. The benches are a little difficult for my daughter to pull out, but that's more because of her young age than any product flaw, as she gets a little bigger, this will not be a problem. Highly recommend this table."
176019,1,"I cannot wait to use this product. I am so excited about it. The sizing recommendations were very accurate, it is nice thick material, it feels like it will help avoid stress on my back, as the strap parts wrap around the shoulders well. After using a Snugli w/ my first daughter, the K'tan feels like a dream!I have practiced using one of her dolls, and the positions are easy to attain, and no special wrapping techniques are needed. It looks like it will be perfect for us!"
38728,1,"We originally got aPRI EuroBath, Pearl Whitebut quickly realized it would take up about half of our small apartment bathroom. We got this instead and love it! I use it in our tub (we don't have a large enough kitchen sink) and have done so since our son was born. We still use it now and he is almost 6 months. I think we will probably stop using it as soon as he can sit up on his own.Provides nice support for your baby, and keeps baby's head slightly elevated and out of the water. In addition, since the pad is like a giant sponge, it keeps baby warm while you are bathing him. Also easy to just hang in the bath to dry.Great product! Highly recommend!"
132765,1,We have our Diaper Dekor right next to the changing table. It makes everything so much easier. Throwing out the old diapers is really easy too and there's no mess. I would highly recommend this to others.
28683,0,I expected something with a richer apperance to the chair but found after receiving the price of $132.00 was in line. As you know I returned the chair as within the third day squeeks and knocks began to happen. I juess I expected more.
44185,1,"This really fits our faucet well. While my son still tugs at it, I can generally keep his hands off it. :) It does push the water more towards the middle of the tub, which really helps when you have a child that likes to feel the water flow over his arms as I do. The bubble dispenser is ""okay"" basically we don't use it now, we just use it for the water push towards the middle.It does make cleaning the tub easier for me as well. I understand it may not fit properly on more ""modern"" faucet types, but our 1981 classic styled one fits great."
176743,1,being parents for the first time is hard enough and by having something so quick and easy to use like this was wonderful. our son was nursed the first month &amp; when we switched to formula it was hard to get the bottle warm fast enough for him in the middle of the night but with the night and day bottle warmer by the time we got the bottle started and him changed it was all ready for him. i recommend filling a bottle with cold water &amp; heating it to the warmth you prefer for your baby so you know what amount of water you need to fill your water gauge with(the numbers on our gauge wore off quickly &amp; it made us know an estimate of how much water we neede to heat it with). we liked this so much we got the first years bottle travel system (cooler with a car travel bottle warmer). definatly a must have!
180599,1,"Prior to buying the Podee I had a very difficult time feeding my infant daughter a bottle when we were on the road, because I wasn't always in the back seat of the car with her and she was not yet old enough to hold her own bottle. Around the time she turned 6 months old I came across the Podee hands free bottle at the baby store and decided to give it a try. Turns out it worked beautifully for us! The baby just sucks on the nipple (like a pacifier) and the milk will flow without them actually having to hold the bottle up to their mouth. On the downside, you might have to get it started for them by sucking some of the initial air out, but that's not really a big deal. It was definitely a lifesaver on our road trips! As a sidenote, we now have a newborn son and when we tried to use the bottle with him at 2.5 months old he was unable to manage it. Perhaps it works best with slightly older (6 months or more) babies. It is definitely worth trying, because when it works it is great!"
167735,1,These sheets fit perfect on the Moses Baby Basket that we have. I couldn't ask for a better fit. They washed up beautifully. We are very pleased with the item.
167597,2,Very disappointingI order this bassinet mattress for our becoming baby throw Amazon for saving time and maybe some money.I ended wasting time and spending money fore nothing.The mattress came late then it was spouts and it was folded in halfWhen I tried it I sew it is too small.I contact the seller and for asking to get a return label - with most of the online sellers do and the lady on the phone told me to send it back and they will refund me laterSo I did - just like they ask me toIn the original order I also paid the shipping that together with the return one was almost the same cost as the mattress itself.The seller - that got back his mattress I did not pay for the expense for both shipping's refund me for half of the money that I spend and did not took any responsibility on the product. They just stick to their return policy - which is very non costumer friendlyThey did offered me when I insist a refund for less the a 1/3 of my expense but they wanted me to take off the negative feedback. So I refused.I would never order anything from them.
1193,1,"We love these diapers. They are thin, but durable. My son can go all night with just one and not leak a drop. Some mothers said that its a harder fit for chubby babies, but my son fits them well, even being on the bigger side. I think if you have problems with leaking, you might be using too small a size. When my son was born, he was almost 9 pounds, and being a young, new mother, I bought the newborn diapers, took them out and put them in my nusery, without checking the weight guidelines. So when I brought him home, he kept leaking everywhere. I was constantly changing him. And I was thinking, omg, is this suppose to be happening? Is he going to soak everything in pee forever? Well, needless to say, I was using too small diapers. So, it stopped happening, except sometimes at night. Newborn babies go ALOT. But anyway, we've been using pampers ever since, though not exclusively. While traveling, which we do a lot, we've bought tons of other diapers, from costco brand to luvs to huggies, and so far, pampers is the best for us. The fit is flexible to fit almost every baby. We love them!"
103839,1,"Great product, pros are that everything is as advertised with an exception of the battery life ( lasts only a few hours, and takes all day to charge ). The menu's are not user friendly. Talk back feature is most used, not to talk to the baby , but for my wife to bug me to get her some juice when i'm working haha. Searched the internet for a better price than $199 but couldnt find one for any cheaper. I held out until i found it for $175 from another website and decided to go for it. $199 is a bit steep. If only they used a battery pack instead of cheap rechargable batteries. either way no regrets."
158479,1,"My little guy loves his sack! I keep buying them larger when he grows because he seems so comfortable in them (as opposed to blankets, which do not stay on!) However, the sizing chart is off - a child 30-35"" is to use a Large and the 35-40"" child should use an X-Large. My son is not yet 32"" and must now use an X-Large because the Large is too short. He is fairly thin, so a heavier child might need to move up earlier/at a shorter height. He doesn't mind the extra length; it gives him more space to kick freely!!"
7324,0,This was more of a purchase for me. I thought my son would really enjoy this and he really showed no interest.
85491,1,"I really love this stroller. My two sons do, too. We use it 5 mornings a week for a 45 minute walk and their ride is very comfortable. You do have to lift up the front wheel a little bit to make sharp turns but I think all of these type of strollers are like that. It is a great stroller!"
3845,2,"Don't buy this gym! Get a bigger one!We have a small house so I thought the smaller gym would be a good idea, but I really regret it. The pieces don't fit together quite right and things hang a little crooked, and it was hard to put together. The toys are not very fun or educational. Last, the narrow width is really bad - once your baby gets excited in the gym and tries to roll over, they can't - they will be prevented by the narrowness and the toy bar. One one of the larger square gyms, rolling over would be no problem, and rolling over is such an important skill. I feel like another gym would have offered a lot more possibilities and growth! I would NOT buy this one again. While I am glad there is a low-priced option for people who really can't afford a larger gym, don't buy this gym if you can possibly afford a bigger one!"
128555,0,"the bottles are great, bpa free etc.however, the nipples kept collapsing and there was no funnel for gas. i eventually switched bottles for my daughter."
12681,1,This is the best gift if your preg and already have kids. My 3 and 6 year old wanted to listed to little Jake in the womb all the time. Now I could not live without this product.
110059,0,"The car seat seems comfy and roomy, but because of the recliner option, the car seat is about 3 inches taller than our other carseat. I have a Jeep Cherokee and I have to fold my 3 year old in half to get him in the car seat."
90617,1,I have never had a problem with pampers these were a great buy with the parents magazine coupon code and they shipped right to my door for free can't beat that!
5930,1,"We were introduced to these outlet covers when we had our house professionally baby-proofed. After while I realized I liked them so much more than the regular outlet covers. They look really sleek and futuristic, and they cover up the yucky painted-over plugs in our older home.I ordered 2 more after we had some work done in our living room that added 2 more outlets, and when they arrived I realized they also come with a foam pad that helps keep air out of the room, insulating the house more effectively. They look great, they protect the baby, and they help keep energy costs down? Hallelujah! I ordered 12 more and now all our outlets (including ones the baby couldn't possibly reach) are upgraded with these covers.I don't think I'll ever live in a house again with the old outlet covers. These things are the best.NOTE: Do *NOT* try to use the BRU version of these! They are cheap as hell (the plastic is about the weight of Kleenex) and the screws don't even reach standard outlets! These Mommy's Helper ones are the way to go. Don't scrimp on this and I promise you won't regret it!"
137650,2,"This is adorable, however I bought it with the intent to use it as a night light for my son and the bulb went dead after about 5 months and cannot be replaced. Very bummed."
77064,1,it was a-gift for a young mom with her hands full--she said its giving her some much needed peace---thank you
35990,1,"I've never written a review before, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity this time. I received my Ultimate Baby Wrap today...I love it and my 9 week old son loves it already! The instructions were a snap and I had the wrap on and my son in it within seconds! He fell asleep after 5 minutes and stayed that way for an hour while I was able to get some long overdue laundry folding done. I love that this will accommodate him when he gets bigger. One of the key features I am looking forward to is the hip carry. This will also come in handy when we go on long day trips with my 3 year old. I have a Sit n Stand Stroller and sometimes my 3 year old wants to nap...there is no place for her to do so if my infant is occupying the front seat. Because the Ultimate Baby Wrap fits nicely in my diaper bag, I can carry my son and let my daughter nap.Great product...highly recommended!"
32465,1,"The gate is easy to install, sturdy, and easy to operate. I was worried about adding the 2 extra extensions i needed to fit a 48"" hallway opening, but it fits excellent. An incredible gate, anyone purchasing this will not regret it."
126115,1,I like that I can get my diapers dropped off at my doorstep whenever I want and don't have to worry about grabbing them at the store. One less thing to put in my shopping cart to put in truck then take in house. Thanks to Amazon mom sign up and it helps that I save money doing it every month with free shipping.Huggies are affordable even without Amazon Mom. I think they fit my boy better than Pampers. They fit better around the legs for some reason. I read some of the reviews and it doesn't take a genius to know how to put on a diaper-any brand. I have no problems with this product. I have only had leakage a couple of times.
179524,1,"We bought this to take our son on his first birthday trip. It was invaluable for wheeling him around the airport. Taking it off and on was very easy, which is good, because it really does need to be removed before the seat can easily fit on an airline seat.Our only complaint was that it couldn't be wheeled down the aisle of the airplane, but that's more the fault of our giant Britax car seat."
154190,0,"When we first started getting these were a great deal and were fine for our son. The changes in packaging & size didn't get us upset (except when they removed the indicator as to which side you should pull the tab from). Recently they started putting a ""approved by the Lorax"" on the packaging. Apparently this is justification for a 50% increase in price! Subscribe & save went from $22-$31 for the same size pack. Time to try some alternatives - 1st stop Pampers Sensitive!"
156587,2,"Not reliable, music stops working, and Fisher Price has a crappy replacement policy and even crappier customer service reps. Buy the Graco if you need a travel swing."
50484,1,"it arrived in 3 days, is really good, my wife said that she will love it more if it was a little more fluffy, i guess is question of preferences."
86255,1,"I bought this monitor and an extra camera because we have a 18 month old and a new born coming. (I write this from the delivery room!) But our 18 month old was in a toddler bed but was sleeping anywhere but the bed, so we wanted to know what he was doing and that he was safe. I couldn't ask for a better camera. There are cheaper ones and more expensive ones. I can't really get the color option, but I don't really need it. Also, being able to hook this up to a bigger TV is AWESOME! My wife just hooks it to our TV in the bedroom and we have no problem seeing our toddler. With two cameras this works wonderfully. Nightvision is very clear with just a nightlight. We have four portible phones, wireless internet, and other devices and we have had little to no interference. This was a great purchase for less than 200 bucks. Something that we can use in a ton of different ways. We love this!"
131626,2,"I wanted to get my child familiar with this thing before I try getting her to sit on it when we are out. I placed this folding potty against the front of my toilet at home, and it seemed stable. My two-year-old said it was comfortable. Then I noticed a puddle growing in front of the toilet and realized that all the pee was coming out! She was just sitting on it normally. I thought I would just let her finish and then clean her up. Well, she started to move or try to get up or something and fell face first onto the ground!The best way I've found to avoid the dirtiest part of the toilet is to sit my kid on the side of the toilet, facing the toilet paper or (even better) the handicapped bar. I usually just hold her as she sits (for stability), and she's never fallen in. This folding potty thing was more trouble than anything. I would not recommend it."
25984,1,"This is the BMW of all highchairs. It's super-sturdy and the Italian leather seat is easy to care for. Ignore the reviews about being a ""pain to clean."" You need to clean EVERY highchair- nooks, crannies, and all."
169112,1,We tried a bunch of different brands and this is the only one that we've used that I can be fairly certain won't leak overnight. It's amazing how much these things can hold!
34931,0,"We purchased this seat for our daughter prior to her birth because it was rated well, would grow with her and it is a nice looking seat with plush fabric. HOWEVER, installing it in the middle of our full sized Chevy Impala back seat was a nightmare. It took a bed pillow folded in half to equal out the seat angle and it still is not tipped back enough because it is resting on the back of the front seats and can't go any further. At 4 months old, there is too much room on either side of my daughter (she slouches and leans even while harnessed down)and I had to remove their head rest and add another because she was too tall, but still needed the support. And, the WORST part is that the angle of the seat itself is 90 degrees or less, so when she's in it, her legs are practically on her belly which is much too sharp of a bent position for a baby this young. I can't imagine having brought her home from the hospital in it. A recent trip to Babies R' Us shows that the seat is already redesigned with side support pillows and a new easier restraint lock (which I'll call and order from Dorel). It hasn't even been 6 months since we bought our seat though, which is dissapointing. On that trip to the store, we bought the Britax Decathlon. We put her in it at the store and it has all of the support and safety we were hoping for. The Alpha Omega Elite will have to wait until she's forward facing and much bigger."
72049,2,"i loved it for a day, because the arms quit working right away. sounded like the gears were stripped, so all we had was slight music or a grinding noise."
14643,1,i love this brand. they work great. they will be great for when my daughter has out grown the bottle...i can use them to put her food in when traveling. the size is so perfect and they stack easily when you don't use the nipples in them. perfect product!
128237,1,My son's face is very sensitive and I can only use these washcloths when I give him a bath. Anything else makes his face break out in a rash. You use it one time and toss it. It's that easy.

69839,1,As always Luvs are the best product out there and they have a super reasonable price! I bought these for my sister who is expecting her first baby so she didn't waste her time trying out those other useless brands.
31641,0,"This brush is no more effective in cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles than any other bottle brush. If you can get a brush cheaper, do so. As a bottle brush, it does the job fine. After 2 months of daily use, mine is only starting to crumble on the edges of the foam."
151888,1,"This product works very well. I had a Safety First bi fold door lock on our closet door previously, and it was useless. My son could open the door, and the lock would just pop right off - giving him even more incentive to open the closet door! This lock works great. It's also very low profile (along with being clear,) you hardly notice it."

177959,1,"It's impossible to avoid things made in China. I don't like it either, but Thermos has been around for years, and has a long standing reputation for making good products.After trying just about every single BPA free sippy on the market, I finally bit the bullet and bought a Foogo. One thing I will say about this, is that it's really heavy for a baby. I bought one when my son was about 9 months old and he wasn't able to hold it at that point, so I had to hold it for him. I was also worried about the valve system, as he had a hard time using cups with valves, but he took to this sippy cup fabulously, and will not use any other cup.A word about leaks. This cup? Should not leak. The parts should come apart easily. We've never had a problem, and any time I've experienced a leak, I've been able to troubleshoot the problem by taking the lid off and usually, it was an issue of the valve not being snapped in all the way. There is a point at which a small bit of water pools in between the valve and the spout, but it's minimal, and not enough to soak your entire living room.I love the entire Foogo line. They're durable, and they hold temperature for a long time."
55341,1,"I thought about getting this product for my first child 3 1/2 years ago, but never got around to actually making the purchase. My second child, now 10 months, is a squirmer. I could not keep a blanket on her at all. I bought a sleepsack (m) at around 4 months or so, and it kept her toasty warm, without overheating her. She didn't need additional blankets during the winter, which was one of my concerns. She has since graduated into a large and now an extra large, which are much more difficult to find! I felt such a large relief when I found this product because my first child used to get tangled up in her blankets, and once, we found her blanket wrapped around her head in the middle of the night. Thank goodness we discovered it in time, but now with the sleepsack, we never worry during the night. It gives us total piece of mind, which I believe is all parents are asking for. This is one of the best products for babies on the market today and I believe everyone should have one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
167142,1,"This stool makes a world of difference when you are nursing! The amount of stress it takes off of your back is noticeable when you put your feet up. I don't used a glider/rocker, but just sit in a big comfy sofa chair and use this stool to prop up my feet. It's wonderful!"
882,0,"I don't know if the diaper generated a yest infection in my baby.also, they are so thick that in order to know if it has been pooped you have to open it because you won't be able to smell it."
145029,1,"I have used this bag off and on for my 2nd baby. I loved the camo and the way it can strap to the stroller handles. Holds quite a bit although it is not a very wide bag, it is perfect for mall or shopping day trip. Since it isn't very frilly or ""girly"" my husband doesn't mind holding it at times. The adjustable straps also make it great to use with different strollers."
43984,1,"These foamy odd-shaped different colored bath toys are absolutely loved by my 6 month old son. He loves the balls that come with the set as well. He wants to play with every piece he happens to see, so even if he's already got a ball in one hand and another toy in the other he will try to grab a third! The only thing I noticed negative about them was that many of the shapes have long skinny parts that my son had gagged on once or twice, so I only let him play with the few more rounded ones for now until he gets a bit older. Other than that, great bath toys - easy to clean up since they don't retain water or even drip much and the baby is fascinated by them."
124467,1,"When my very large 4 month old outgrew his infant carrier, I got one of these so we could continue to go to the grocery store. Even though he is just starting to sit up, he does very well in this cover. I use the pillow to prop him up, and he is very comfortable. It is so padded! I just put my wallet & keys in the pocket and off we go. It installs in seconds and comes off just as quickly. It is expensive compared to other brands, but it covers the whole cart and is VERY well designed. We will be using this for a long time to come. It is heavily padded all the way around the cover. I have yet to use it in a restaurant high chair, but I imagine I will like it there as well."
29573,1,"I bought this one for my granddaughter she loves them, and they all come with names."
3475,1,"This pacifier is so cute and could make anyone laugh. I bought it as a shower present for my niece, and there's nothing like getting pictures emailed to you with a sweet baby using this bink. It's a great little gag gift to include in a present for a new mom, especially if you tease the new mom about Twilight."
160390,2,"As has been exhaustively described by reviews here, the splash cup is very poorly designed on these Ginsey potty seats.But my bigger complaint is how easily the seat moves around on the toilet. Yesterday, my three year old sat down for his nightly potty. He leaned forward, as we have taught him to do precisely to avoid peeing over the poorly designed splash guard. The seat actually flipped forward on top of the toilet-- think of a manhole cover flipping in a looney tunes cartoon, and dumped my son on the floor. He face planted head first into the ground. The whole thing happened in about 1.5 second.Luckily, we had a bathroom rug, albeit a thin one, so he got away with only a swollen upper lip (and probably the worst crying bout he has had in about a year). So yea, I wholeheartedly do NOT recommend the Ginsey potty seat, unless potty training is progressing too easily for you."
49504,0,"The superyard does the trick nicely as an exercise pen for rabbits. However the plastic is very stiff and very difficult to bend, which makes collapsing to carry nearly impossible. It takes 2 of us to change it's shape from rectangle to round."
171573,2,Let me start by saying I loved the hammock feature. But now that my son is almost 4mo old he's too big for the hammock and he just seems uncomfortable in the tub.
121332,1,"I love this bag. It's been many years since I have toted around a diaper bag....this one is convenient, durable, and stylish. I've gotten many compliments on it. Most of all I love the material, very stain resistant."
140429,1,"This product's best feature is that it plugs into a power outlet. I had the Aquarium Swing prior to this one and the Rainforest Cradle Swing is nice, I just wish it had more bells and whistles like the Aquarium Swing did. Overall, my daughter loves this swing. Another nice feature that is that the seat swivels 180 degrees and she can sit upright or recline in it. I just wish the tray had some toys that she could play with. My daughter is 4 months old. We just attached rings to the tray and she loves to bat at them."
107817,1,"This product is worth every penny! I only breastfed for a couple weeks but when I got too sore to feed this was a painless, efficient way to get my infant natural milk. I love that this system comes with 2 bottles, and 2 of those little white rubber things that go inside the pump because the first time I washed the pump I dropped 1 and was so glad I had the other one to replace it immediately. (The pump won't work without that one small piece) The pump starts let-down quickly and since it's manual you can control your flow of milk to mimic your child's natural suckling pattern. Wonderful product, I highly recommend it!"
114646,1,"I like it especially because it is portable, we can even carry it while traveling and also to the restaurants so we can use our own chair and avoid germs"
49769,1,This was easy to fix and is easy to operate. Helping me a lot in keeping things away from my son.
64623,2,"The title says it all really. It's cute, but doesn't hold much, especially considering how large it looks. I bought a big purse and keep a gallon sized freezer bag with diapers, etc in it. That is more convenient."
65377,1,I love this potty chair! When I ran out of bags I started using a regular plastic bag with 1/2 of a size one diaper in it (I cut up old ones that no longer fit my kids).
147426,1,"This is a must have!!! I didnt get one for my shower and for the first 6 weeks she wanted to be held and every time i put her in her swing she would scream. I had a friend recommend this seat and i am so glad she did! She never did like the swing and she loved this seat. She could bounce and move herself and she just seemed more comfortable and free than she did in the swing.It is also great that it is so portable that you can put it in the bathroom while showering or put it in the car with ease to bring to the in laws house. When it was time to start solids at 6 months, i used this as a feeding seat and it worked out great. When she started really sitting up good and getting stronger it was time to get rid of this seat and i had such a hard time because it had become such a life saver. I kept trying to use it but she would just start flipping herself foward in it so i had to stop using it. It is the best baby product ever and she loved her little animals she played with. The elepahant was her fave."
146270,1,"We received this as a shower gift, and it was one of the best items that gets a lot of use now! I am keeping this for all my kiddies that is for sure. My son is a big guy and loves alot of active play. This thing is perfect for him, we put him in it when he was only 2 months old and at the time, he would just hang on it and touch the toys. He would be okay in it for only about 5-10 minutes, and we figured this was one of those silly toys that wasn't going to get much use. WRONG! COME THE 3-4 months and he loves it! Now at 5 months he loves it so much, it is part of his twice a day physical play routine! Once in the morning while I make him some food, and once in the evening a bit before bedtime to ware him out. Which it definitely does. After a good 15 minutes in this thing he is ready to sleep through the night! He jumps and plays with the toys so much getting so excited it is so fun to see. I know friends that purchase other comparable jumpers and they are either too high to the ground, all in one color which is not beneficial for their development, or too low to the ground. This has the best blend of everything! It is the perfect height from level 1 to 3, the music is fun NOT annoying, the spinning toys are very interesting to him. The other reviewer mentioned the peekaboo tiger and spinning wheel are useless... I agree, they seem like an after thought but the rest of the toys on it are so much fun! Definitely a top baby item."
70294,2,"Hard to install, ridiculously confounding installation directions, and when you're done, it's flimsy. Don't waste your money."
24248,1,Great sheet. I know that the label says not to put it in the dyer but I've always dried it on high heat. I've even washed it in hot water and thrown it in the dryer. There is just no way I would always remember to line dry it. It still fits my mini co-sleeper perfectly. I've always found putting the sheet on to be quite easy. I like how this sheet fits the co-sleeper perfectly. You won't have to worry about it coming lose. It's not super soft but I actually like that.
173414,1,"Love that you can recline back, change position etc. If the baby get bored just switch to a new song, new position, etc. Doesn't work for all babies (I have a friend who's son did not like swings at all) but this is a great one for babies that love movement like mine."
6270,0,"After we used this monitor for about three weeks, the infrared night vision went out on the system. I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement with little problem. My new monitor gives me feedback if I turn it up too loud which the other one didn't do, but I just have to remember to keep it down.The handheld receiver works excellent. I can take it downstairs or outside and the reception is awesome! Which says a lot considering we have cordless phones, cell phones, and a wireless Network that doesn't seem to interfere at all.Overall, I LOVE the product ( overly helpful 6 yr old and baby share a room), but based off of my own experience and the reviews of others, there does appear to be a defect (worthy of a recall in my opinion) with the night vision part. If that were remedied, I would give this product five stars."
156190,1,"Love the looks of this swing--- it's by far, the classiest swing I've seen. All in all it's a great swing-- my only complaint is that the ""nature sounds"" don't sound anything like nature. The music is very nice though."
59972,1,"This is by far the best bathtub ever. I tried 2 other ones, a sling one and a 4 in 1 that were awful. I was afraid he was going to fall out. Untill I read reviews on this one. At the time they didn't have it at Babies R Us and I went crazy looking for it, untill I turned around one day and Babies R Us did have it. My son at 9 lbs fit so well into it. We didn't have to worry about him slipping or going anywhere. And you don't have to hold him with one hand. The seat is deep enough so he stays in the water which keeps him warmer. He's 10 weeks old now and loves to splash around. It also comes with a hook, so after the bath it just gets hung on the back of our tub. And once he gets older, he can use the other side of it for many months to come. What a great product!"
60465,1,"This product is great, yeah it is bigger then the average but it is so light and it is not bulky at all! one side is for infants and the other side is for children up to 24 months. This is two baths for the price of one, and it has a hole to hang it up for storage. I mean what were some people expecting a Jacuzzi?"
40602,1,"We have 4 kids - 2 boys and 2 girls. My oldest is four. We have used a lot of diapers over the last four years. We have found the cruisers to be expensive but worth it. The elastic bands provide a snug but comfortable fit and keep in poop and pee the longest. The time and effort needed to change a dirty outfit far outweigh the savings of using cheaper, lower quality diapers.You may find that if your baby is narrower or wider that other diapers do fit him or her better. Also, some people find that the difference between boys and girls peeing patterns make a diference in choice of diapers. Personally, we have found Pampers cruisers the best choice overall.[...]"
165735,1,pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs. however their collect points promotion is misleading. by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection. also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store. dishonest and mean spirited. next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity.
151235,2,This is NOT an authorized Britax car seat cover. Real Britax covers are cuter AND cheaper! Get the real thing!
68659,1,"If you want a GREAT deal, go to Costco and buy the Kirkland brand diapers...they're made by the SAME FACTORY as the Pampers Swaddlers...a 248 count box costs 29.76...that's 12 cents/diaper!!!! They're the same product & the same great fit!!!!!!!!"
119886,1,"My husband and I saw this product and decided to give it a try, we loved it and have been buying it ever since for our liitle baby boy. Yes, babies naturally smell good but this cologne also has a baby like smell to it. Everyone that holds him says ""he smells so good, just like a baby"". Also it's mild and does not irritate the babies skin. We just can't get enough of it. Unfortunately, it's hard to find in the stores."
129444,1,Great little toy. Very young babies - 4ish months onward - can grasp it easily - and it's easy not to drop. Subtle rattle in the middle. We keep ours by the changing table for babies to hold during the change.
162712,2,I am sorry for buying this swing set. Worked well only for one week and then it worked whenever it felt like it. It didn't come with documentation on who to contact or how to get it fixed or exchanged. I am very dissapointed with this company.
124610,1,"This crib skirt was the perfect touch for my daughter's pink and brown room! The pink color of the tulle matched my daughter's bedding perfectly; ours is not purple-ish, as some other reviewers have described. The tulle is high quality and seems durable. It does not look cheap at all. It is very cute and classic looking. I would recommend this adorable crib skirt for any little princess' room!"
144666,0,"I like that this a safe (according to skindeep) sunscreen. It seems to protect my son and did not irritate his skin at all. It is very difficult to apply, it does not spread and I end up having to rub it all over his skin anyway, which he does not enjoy. It is easy to transport and I like having it in the diaper bag for emergencies as it won't make a mess."
70572,1,We brought this rocker because our 4 month old outgrew her bouncy seat. She loves it! She is now 7 months old and still uses it every day. We do have to watch her closely in it now as she can flip it over!
106439,1,"We've been using the diaper champ for 8 weeks now with our first baby. It's easy to assemble, easy to use, and easy to change bags. The bags are the best part. I don't have to worry about purchasing refills or running out of them when using this product. It also contains the odors. You never smell stinky diapers until you change the bag which is no different than taking the garbage out. I highly recommend the Diaper Champ over the other popular options."
2385,1,"My daughter occasionally collects a little bit of residue from the diaper down there, but for the most part it's clean, doesn't deteriorate, and holds a lot of water."
171624,1,"Hi- We registered for a different tub and HATED IT! It was a two piece tub that leaked everywhere (it was literally cut in half!)! Who makes a two peice tub?? So out of frustration went out with everyone and looked for a new tub..price was right, the sling was great and it seemed the right size..so brought it home...LOVED IT! My daughter actually looked like she was happy..the other tub's sling was so weird, hung off the back...she looked miserable. She is now over 7 months and a big girl, about 19 lbs, and she has been in the infant seated position for a few months, and SHE LOVES IT TOO! She splashes around and has so much fun!I would highly recommend this tub for ease of use, cleaning and storage."
96260,1,"I love my hotsling. I bought it when my 5 month old was getting too heavy to carry for very long. He is now over 20 lbs and I use it as a hip carrier all the time - watering the plants outside, walking on the beach, runnning into the grocery store for a few things, doing chores around the house. He loves it too. He is very content in it, and enjoys ""participating"" in my chores instead of being stuck in his exersaucer or highchair. It is a little pricey for a simple piece of material (why I didn't give it 5 stars), but it works, and I am happy with my purchase. Making sure you get the right size is crucial! I got a size 2 and probably could have gotten a size 1. But I washed it in hot water and put it in the dryer and now it is perfect."
159227,0,"I do agree with the other reviewers, my son does enjoy his seat, esp the vibration mode..however, the sound is really annoying! The ""bubbles"" sound is so loud that if I am on the phone and it is on in the background people will stop and ask what that noise is! My older kids and husband hate the sound too. I suppose not too bad of an inconvenience if it is entertaining your child. Still, if you are noise sensitive, try it out at Babies R Us first. On a positive note, it is well made. My son is tall and big for his age and the chair seems longer than most, enabling him to stay in it longer. He is now 5 mos and it still fits."
159615,0,"We needed a 2nd bouncy seat and went down the line several stores waiting for our daughter to light up when she sat in the right chair. This was the one. As soon as I sat her in it, her little face lit up and she giggled. However, since buying it, she gets bored and frustrated with it very quickly. I think she gets tired of hearing the songs. She likes to watch the dog shake and the lights blink but I think she gets aggitated after listing to the sounds over and over. The cat and the bunny are still out of her reach. I also use it as a feeding chair by taking the toy bar off and laying a towel over it. She seems to like it just as much without the toy bar on too. It reclines her just enough but not too much. I gave it 3 stars because I think it's overpriced and it needs a mute switch so the lights can still work without the songs...it's not a good sign when the baby gets annoyed by the sounds too."
139800,1,"My daughter is 12 months today. We have had this walker for 2-3 months. She still loves it. She has snack time in front of the TV in it and I am able to speed clean. OF COURSE, I wouldn't leave her alone in it. She is pretty active - not walking yet - but she loves to climb. I don't think she could ever climb out of it, but I'm not going to chance it.We haven't had any problems with it... safety or otherwise... I started to buy the mini mastreo walker but was turned off by some of the reviews. The main reason I bought this one is, reviews on that one were mostly displeased with how hard it was to turn. This one is very easy to turn. My girl spins in circles, even on the carpet and on our wood deck!Yes, it is bulky, but have you seen a walker that's not? They have to be so that they can't be tipped over! The only problem I have with it is... there is not a volume switch. It is not too loud, but when you've had a rough day and have a nice headache to prove it - keep them away from this toy!"
7688,1,"I'm happy with this product, it came in a reasonable amount of time. The best part is the low price this was about 3 times cheaper than the same size bottle I saw in a local store."
99923,1,"they fit my daughter perfectly and i dont have to worry about leaks or anything anymore, before i started using Pampers Baby Dry Diapers my daughter's diaper would always leak esp when she pooped but now with Pampers Baby Dry Diapers they can totally handle anything she dishes out."
21435,0,"I was so excited when this product arrived, but was not expecting such a difficult assembly process. I consider myself a relatively intelligent person, but I found the instructions to be lacking. Additionally, one of the tubes was not drilled properly for the handle and we are not ale to complete the assembly. Hopefully, our son is not strong enough to pull the handle out of the base as it is not secured properly. He hasn't used this product yet, but I believe he will love it despite the issue with the handle."
77198,1,"We've been using this swing for 4 1/2 months now and it has worked good for us. The baby likes it and naps in it occassionally. There are a few things about it that I don't care for though. For one, I wish I had bought one that plugs in the wall. This one takes D batteries, which we've replaced once so far. Another is the characters on the mobile face out, not down, so the baby just sees the bottoms of them moving, which I think makes it pointless to have them on there, but she likes the mirror. Other than that it's good. We haven't had any mechanical problems so far. It was pretty easy to assemble, I did it by myself while pregnant and it didn't take very long. All in all it's worked good for us so far, it keeps the baby content and entertained while I get things done around the house."
138129,1,"These nigh lights are a favorite in our home, and now a favorite gift to give to anyone with young children! My son still loves his turtle night light at age 4.5!"
9914,0,I love this lotion a lot. It moisturizes my skin and leaves it smelling good. It's good for all types of skin from normal to extra dry. It's good for me because other lotions break my skin out and this lotion doesn't. You can even use it on a daily basis. You won't regret using it.
175742,1,"Good thing for a newborn. My daughter just sleeps in it through the night and can't get her hands out, which means no wake-ups. Plus it is soft and warm. I wish Halo has the bigger size with swaddle feature as well."
102926,0,"I bought this because it was much cheaper than the diaper genie, and because the regular diaper was unbearable! It's not completely odorless, but an improvement from what we were using before. I just wonder how to get more of those little scented disks to put in it so it will not get stinky. It seems to get full very fast though."
142497,1,The is a great drying rack if you don't have a lot of counter space. It is much more than any other drying rack in the stores and it is more vertical that the picture shows. It is white and the bottle brush is the item that varies in color.
32222,1,"This mill is easy to use. It's easy to clean. The only thing that I would change would be the wooden handle. If not for that handle, I would throw all the pieces into the dishwasher."
19986,0,"my biggest complaint is that the design of the smallest bowl doesn't allow the suction cup to really stick. the other's stick fairly well. my 1 year old can still pull them off of her tray sometimes but like someone else mentioned, they are good for holding the bowl in place while she is using her spoon by herself. i often have to press them down several times to resuction but that is fine. i'm pretty happy with these bowls aside from the suction being useless on the small blue bowl."
162608,2,"We received this for a shower gift and at first it was great because it fits in the sink and folds for storage under the sink. That being said, my daughters feet almost got stuck in the hinges. We have to stop using it altogether becasue the hinges have snapped underneath so when she was in the tub (over the sink) one of the sides colapsed. I will be writing a letter to the manufacturer and letting them know that this could be very dangerous. We have used the tub for less than 2 months!"
19138,1,"This is my 2nd light on shoulder sling, the 1st was a baby shower gift and now I bought this one for the spring/summer months ahead. My daughter loves being carried around in it and I also use it to nurse her while I'm shopping or trying to eat myself. All you got to do is through a nursing cover on and you have 2 hands again! I LOVE this sling, and I have had many bad ones I suffered through with my son. Great buy and product!"
155912,2,"This stroller is rather difficult to manuever when your baby is more than 15 lbs. or so. Now that my baby is 2 (and not very heavy at all), It feels like I have to force the stroller into turns (no, the wheels are not locked :-)) and the stroller seems to be creaky. My sister has the same experience. Rather disappointed, I don't recommend this stroller for this reason."
54019,2,This item is basically useless if you have leather seats unless you want to ruin them and pin the mirror into the leather. I also tried attaching the mirror to the seat belt but it does not reflect high enough. This is a waste of money for me. I think it would work if you have headrests in your back seat (I know some cars do).
126774,0,I love Huggies & have used them for all of my children. Unfortunately they have changed there design print on the diapers. It has a lot of blue in the design & leaves what looks like bruises on the inner thighs of my baby. Not so good... I was very worried the 1st time I saw it but thankfully it did fade in the bathtub. Will not purchase again until they change the design.
160177,1,"I had this on my registry because I had seen it on other people's lists of baby things to get. I didn't get it, so I used a gift certificate to buy it. I am so glad! I cannot do the whole swaddling thing so that it stays wrapped up and my newborn loves to be all wrapped up. This blanket makes it so easy and it stays in place with velcro. The bottom flap comes down so you can change the diaper without unwrapping baby's arms, which is really nice. She sleeps much longer without startling when she is wrapped in this blanket and doesn't get too hot. I'm now going to give this as a baby gift to everyone I know who's expecting."
164197,1,"No diaper is perfect, that's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. These are however the best we've used so far (and we've used quite a lot of different brands and types). Fewer blow-outs and seems to hold a lot of pee overnight. Thumbs up :)"
110785,0,"My child had a really hard time using these as they are small and the forks don't really pick up anything. i saw a lot of good reviews on this, but they didn't work well for us."
18686,0,"I heard great things about this, but my son was able to get himself out of this swaddle by 3 months."
168286,0,"This product is extremely leaky for a newborn, probably one out of five diapers leaked and he needed new clothes, bedding, ect. Pretty much every poo went through. However, the wetness indicator is helpful for new parent who is too tired to pick baby up to see if he needs changed."
3303,0,"My son is 4 1/2 months old and 16 pounds. 65th percentile - he's not huge by any means. We had an ok experience with the smaller size when he was younger, but after the velcro wore out and he no longer fit into them, we ordered two of these with the hope that they would perform the same - just in a larger size!Not so. Gabriel can break out of one of these with the least bit of effort; and, yes, he is dressed in them properly. Even though he is supposed to be within the weight/size limits listed by the company, when the top seam of the SwaddleMe is at his shoulder his hands are already at the bottom seam of the torso portion - nothing like the child pictured.Whether it's his size or the strength of the velcro - that, by the way, isn't really ""Velcro"" at all, it's very thin hook-and-loop - it's very easy for him to work his way out of these. The fact that he is able to do that also poses a strangulation hazard in my eyes, since the hook and loop closure doesn't always come completely undone and the portion that remains fastened slips up around his neck. I have also seen him, while he is wriggling out of the SwaddleMe, raise his arms and bring the fastened fabric up over his face - suffocation, anyone?This SwaddleMe worked for us for about a week. I feel much safer swaddling him using the DUDU method with a very large receiving blanket - if this swaddle comes undone, it just falls away and doesn't pose any type of hazard. (See: [...] or Google search DUDU swaddle)Bottom line: this worked at the beginning. My son still needs the security of swaddling, but is apparently too big or too strong and exceeds the working capacity of the SwaddleMe. If you have a hearty, healthy infant, try something else!"
79723,1,"I ordered this bracelet based on other positive reviews, but was still a little ""unsure,"" since the price was much less than other pearl bracelets I found. I was pleasantly surprised; however, when it arrived.The card (with bracelet/penny, etc.) was in a thick glass frame (it's hard to tell by the picture provided) and was set in a toulle-like gift bag with a draw string. The bracelet itself was comprised of silver beads, with 4 pearls interspersed evenly throughout the tiny bracelet, along with a blue ribbon attached to it. It is noted that the bracelet is very small and is definitely for an infant, rather than a child who is getting Christened.The poem was beautiful and touching. I love the idea that it is supposed to go throughout her life with her to her wedding day. How special!!! I was so excited to purchase this for my goddaughter's Christening and am so glad I did."
16972,1,this is soooo cute!!!!! and well worth the time for a daughter!!
138658,1,"I bought this for my 2 year old niece. She absolutely fell in love with it and talks to its sweet face. It works well at night, lighting the room with the stars and moon making it a perfect night light for her. It is easy to operate so she can choose on her own the color of lights she prefers."
127572,0,"We had to put this thing together over a couple of days because there were so many steps and, especially, because a piece that is designed to stay embedded in the wood came out while trying to screw in one of the pieces. It was VERY difficult to fix this and we scratched up one of the legs pretty badly while making the fix. It wasn't just mistakes that scratched this crib; connecting the metal bed frame to the wood left several significant scratches along the way and I even managed to leave a noticeable mark by hitting part of the crib with my wedding ring.I was very frustrated with this crib when putting it together and thought for awhile that we would have to return it. I think DaVinci could make changes to make assembly easier and I'm especially bummed that our 'new' crib has half a dozen big scratches on it just from assembly. I certainly feel like I could have bought a used unit and felt just as good about the looks and I would have saved a lot of frustration in the assembly. However, once we finished, we stepped back and were really pleased with how the crib looks. My experience with this crib didn't start well, but I think this will be a product that will prove to be durable and a good buy over time."
26273,1,We travel a lot with our two year old and have always bought a plane seat for her. This bag makes it easier to carry her carset and other supplies while running through the airport. Overall it is very durable with one exception. We have been in situations where we have had to drag this bag and there are now some holes in it. The truth is not many products would not have a hole if they were treated how we have treated this bag. The best solution (and one I would love) is if they would come out with a similar product that had wheels.
170938,1,"We have tried many different baby monitors and this is by far the best. We live on a farm and this has the longest range, and by far the longest battery life of any baby monitor digital or analog. We can be more than 100 yards from the house and still get perfect reception. I would highly recommend this to anyone. The written specs on this product as far as range are not as good as the graco digital monitor, but the difference is the Phillips literature is conservative and the Graco literature is bordering on false advertising as far as effective range. We also own the Graco 2.4 GHZ digital monitor and it has no where near the range of the Phillips monitor. If you're not taking the monitor outside the house and you live in a small house, the Graco is fine. But if you are planning on taking the monitor outside spend the extra money and get the Phillips, it's worth it."
132326,1,"I love this wipe warmer. My daughter loves the warm wipes. The warmer heats the wipes to about the same temp as her bath water. My wipes are staying moist. I am filling the warmer half full on the advise from a friend, so they don't dry out. So far no problems. I am getting another one for our downstairs changing area. The nightlight is nice because you can see how many wipes are left."
61214,1,"You have to get one of these! I would not go without one! I found that it has a rather small capacity so I only use it for poopy diapers, but it takes care of the smell! No nursery should be without one!"
118601,1,"I purchased the baby food grinder after reading reviews from other users. I wanted a quick way to make food for my 7 month old. I got it yesterday and have LOVED it so far! I dropped 1/2 a banana and 1/2 a strawberry in it for a healthy puree to mix with her oatmeal for breakfast. For lunch, I ground up some broccoli and carrots cooked really soft. She has loved both items and she generally hates packaged baby food bananas and carrots. This was pretty easy to use and definitely easy to clean. The blade is not sharp (it sort of mashes and grinds rather than cutting) so you don't have to worry about cutting yourself on sharp parts. I do think I will probably purchase a food processor or another method for large-scale baby food making for freezing. Even if you stuff the grinder full, I don't think it would make more than about 2 meals at a time. Perfect for super-fresh and on-the-go, but not quite ideal for making a week's worth of food at a time. Exactly what we were looking for!Pros:Easy to useEasy to clean (just pop the parts apart and wash with dish soap or put in the dishwasher)Carrying case makes it very portableCons:Would not be good for large quantities as it generally makes enough for about one or two feedings at a time."
122855,2,"Not only is this swaddler harder to put on (takes longer than the Velcro kinds because you have to loop additional fabric over each arm and under their back) but my 3 month old was able to wiggle her arms out of it even when I have snuggly wrapped her in it! For all that hassle of exfra fabric (which annoys her while putting it on) I still end up with a baby waking herself up by her hands touching her face! I'm going to see if making the ""arm loops"" less loose helps though the directions say to make it loose around their arms, I may have to do it tighter? Just to let you know if you're also having this issue. If she couldn't get out, this would be a 4 star product due to the hassle nd length of time it takes to put on.The only pro this has over other swaddlers is that it doesn't have that loud sound of Velcro every time you put it on and take it off.Also, I couldn't find this product in an organic fabric. If the company is reading this, I would love an organic option. Thanks! ;)"
39515,1,I ordered this sleep sack for my nearly two year old who still loves being put to bed in her sleep sack. The size is definitely suitable for a 2 + year old and the quality is the same high standards as all Halo products. Grandma jokingly said that they look like they will fit until kindergarten. My only wish is that Halo would make long sleeved sleep sacks in all sizes.
144970,2,"the baskets are good in size, but the linning is poorly made. It came with the loops falling apart and the ribbons are much darker than shown."
162649,0,My son has used this tub for about 3 months. The fact that it folds up is an advantage. It has kept him secure and has eased him into feeling comfortable in water. Now that he is 4 months old he has as out grown it since only a small amount of his body is actually underwater and he now wants to play in the tub.
94545,2,"When registering for baby products, my husband and I had no idea where to start with choosing baby bottles, so of course we assumed the Avent were the best since they are more expensive. We quickly learned our lesson! We used the bottles for a month, my daughter was always so cranky after a feeding and we couldn't figure out why. It turned out that it was gas that was causing her so much pain. She would scream and scream! We finally realized, after noticing all of the bubbles in the bottle, there was too much air getting into her belly! On top of that her shirt would be soaked after a feeding, the smallest nipple they have for those bottles is still too much for an infant. She would drink the bottle so fast and it would just pour down her cheek onto the front of her. Needless to say we stopped using the Avent bottles, (now that we have 2 dozen!) and switched to the Playtex Ventaire, it was such a huge difference, no bubbles in the bottle, no belly pain from gas, and no formula stained shirt! We love these new bottles."
137929,0,orange hue is not so visible unless the room is dark. Looks solid. Wish there are more colors! Kids like it.
49356,0,"I bought the North States Superyard to use as a gate to keep my dog in the living room when I am out of the house. It was easy to assemble and fit my doorway with extra room to spare. The only problem is, my dog jumps right over the gate as soon as I leave the house. It's a great divider for when I'm home, but that's not really why I bought it."
116379,0,"This gate works and looks nice, but we are more satisfied with our other type of gate, so we are returning it. You have to push a small latch, then lift up on the entire gate to open it, which is not easy when you are carrying a baby. It swings closed, but doesn't always latch. The wood looks nice and is good quality, but when you open the gate to almost 90 degrees, it makes a loud popping noise, which isn't nice if your baby is asleep. The First Years metal gate with foot pedal release is the best choice in our opinion."
184616,1,"This little thing is very handy. No, there is no padding under the mat. That's okay with me - I wanted something really compact. 2-3 diapers fit comfortably in the netting; 4 is a squeeze. That was nice when I had 2 kids in diapers because I could put 2 of each size in the pocket. The great thing about this is that you can just grab it and go - no need to take the whole bulky diaper bag into the bathroom. We ended up having a much smaller diaper bag as a result. It is actually one of the Old Navy messenger bags.The wipes holder is hard plastic, which I like. Unfortunately we stepped on it and it cracked. We bought a replacement one - it is standard size."
104684,1,always had the problem that baby would squeeze juice bottle and get it all over himself.. this was a great purchase!
8490,1,adheres well to our table and people even complemented that it looks decent. no problems with pealing off. will recommend buying.
128753,1,i went on the avent site and this product does not show up as bpa free. can anyone confirm this? the ad is misleading to say bpa free.
169573,1,"A diaper bag that a man will carry, YEAH!!!!! Sometimes I use if we are carrying alot. The messager bag style allows for comfort and keeps the bag out of your way. Worth the money."
24088,1,"After trying the medium, large, extra large it seems the small flanges fit and I can get the same amount of milk out in 5 minutes that it used to take me 30 minutes with the larger flanged. No pain because there's less friction."
129967,1,We already had the one Snug Ride Base so we just bought this forthe second vehicle because it was a great price.Works great and we don't mind the color.
15237,2,"Picture shows pretty pattern this is why I ordered them. However, I only received solid white ones instead in a timely fashion. Didn't complain, maybe should."
67276,2,"We purchased the Safety 1st Lift and Lock Security Gate to use at the top of the stairs when our son became mobile. We carefully followed all of the instructions and secured the gate into the door frame with the enclosed hardware. However, we experienced problems with the gate when we began using it in 2009. We found the gate difficult to open, the handle would stick, and this would put pressure on the hinges screwed into the wall on the other side.One day when I was reaching over the gate to pick up our cat, the top hinge cracked and broke apart, and the gate came completely off the door frame! I flew head first down a flight of stairs and was knocked unconscious. I suffered a traumatic brain injury and have been out of work ever since.The company only gave us a replacement gate (which was equally faulty in design) and have denied any responsibility in the matter. I have learned that the company recalled other safety gates due to defects in design. I urge everyone to stop using these gates right away! You would never want your child, or yourself, to experience what I have."
32654,1,This fence works to keep little ones away from a fireplace but it looks nice too!
84786,2,"This is definitely a case of getting what you paid for! The plastic is really thin and cheap, and took my 2 year old all of 2 minutes to pop the cover right off the door knob. It unsnaps into 2 pieces for easy installation, but unfortunately also makes for easy removal as well. There is a hole in the front of the cover (to allow access to a door lock/key hole) but my kiddo realized he can stick his fingers through the hole and, without having to apply much pressure, easily separate the 2 halves of the cover. I will be investing a couple more bucks into something more durable and not as easy to open."
141900,1,"I've been using this guard for 6+m and just ordered another one to use on the crib's head board. It's fairly easy to install. I have a modern white crib, so it doesn't stand out much. It's not a 100% perfect fit, but close enough to where I'm super happy. Our 1yr old was gnawing away on the rail (leaving teeth marks and scraping paint!) so this was very needed. Hey, it's even made in the USA! I'd recommend this any day, it's been a true crib savior."
103891,0,I was looking for a falange for my lansinoh breastpump. This one worked but it doesnt replace my broken falange.
152155,1,"It fits on the crib, the stroller, and the gate. It's awesome. My son loves the changing lights and the sound is amazing for such a little speaker. The free downloads don't hurt either."
118230,1,I WAS NEW TO THE IDEA AND HAD HEARD MANY STORIES ABOUT HOW HARD IT WAS GOING TO BE. THIS PRODUCT WAS VERY EASY TO USE AND SETUP. IT WAS GREAT AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS TO MANY OF MY FRIENDS THAT ARE NOW EXPECTING.
57917,1,"This product was actually great when I first started using it. I did have to adjust the water but that wasn't as difficult as some other reviews make it out to be. I did notice that after a while the water started to turn brown and I had to wipe off the element about once a week. I notice some people said it only heats slender bottles, this is not true. It also does heat up the wideneck dr. brown's bottles, the cooler just doesn't hold them. You have to take the plastic ring off the warmer to heat them. The cooler would be better if it held three bottles instead of two. All in all it was a pretty good product but if you have the room, I would just get a regular bottle warmer and keep a small cooler that holds more bottles."
115999,1,"This basket is a good buy if you are looking for a simple moses basket for everyday use. The price puts this in the affordable category where some of the other moses baskets out there are more of a luxury item with the luxury price tag. You may find baskets with higher quality bedding but this has a really nice looking reversible liner. The reverse of the liner is white with pastel dots. The hood is totally detachable, and uses velcro wich holds pretty tight, though it is the only reason I deducted a star since it is the least attractive feature on the basket and still hardly an eyesore once you put the liner in it. I can not end this without mention of Target's speedy processing of this order - I ordered this late at night on a Tuesday and received it by Friday afternoon. The free shipping they were offering made this a great deal! Not disappointed."
32988,2,"I bought this product due to the sloping seats in my Dodge Caravan and thought that it was going to be very useful. Boy, was I wrong. When I tried to put this under my infant carseat it brought the carseat so far away from the back of the seat that I was unable to safely buckle it. There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule. (the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost."
149663,2,"I ordered this item on Nov 28th. I received it 2 weeks later and the side panel was shattered. I called Storkcraft to get a replacement part and they told me it would be another 3 weeks plus shipping time. Today is December 26th, i am 9 months pregnant and there is still no sign of my replacement parts. I have tried calling the company to follow up and the phone number goes right to voicemail saying it can not take any more messages. Needless to say in hindsight i would have just spent the extra money for an item i could have returned to the store. Storkcraft is a horrible company to work with and i do not recommend this changing table!!!!"
49931,2,"The Britax Esprit stroller is reallly nice looking and I liked it at first. But after about a month, the recline would lower by itself and the locking clip became really hard to use. The backrest is really just a flimsy piece of plastic that offers no support and it is impossible to adjust or raise when my baby is in the seat. Now I'm looking for a new stroller...I do not recommend this stroller at all."
9688,1,Great purchase! My son loves this seat. The splash guard is high enough for little boys who are learning to stay seated the entire potty experience. ;) The bowl in the middle is easy to remove and clean. I would definitely recommend this potty to any of my friends.
117598,1,My grandson just loves this and is building his coordination and leg strength...it's amazing that he has made progress holding up his head too! He just loves it for as long as you let him play ...I wish it had an interactive component that when he bounced it made a sound ...to reward him .....just thinkin'
37414,1,"We used this bag with our Peg Perego Vela single stroller which we gate checked on a recent trip. In total, we had 3 flights and the bag held up very well, was easy to open, put stroller in and zip up in a hurry. You can see the dirt on the outside of bag at the end of trip so made me happy that it wasn't my stroller getting dirty... Definately worth the extra money over that red ""Gate check"" bag everyone seems to buy."
149822,1,"This was a lifesaver for a cross country drive with a 2 year old. We like that it is soft, which made it easy to store and was safe for our child. It cleans easy, as peanut butter and jelly came right out with a quick dab with the baby wipes. The ridge on the edges kept crayons and toys from falling off. Highly recommend for use with toddlers."
56007,1,"This heats bottles fast and has auto turnoff when it is down, but I still watch it to make sure doesnt over heat. would recommend"
31543,1,"Wonderful product. Saves so much space, easy to put together and clean. Needed it months ago. It fits nicely on our bathroom counter and has great airflow."
104138,2,"I do not get this blanket at all. My child needs to be swaddled super-tight in order to sleep. We use the swaddlers with the velcro fastners pretty religiously because if he manages to squeeze out a hand or kick out a leg in his sleep, he will wake up crying. So he really has to be wrapped. This blanket in my opinion is overpriced and does not do a good job of keeping baby wrapped up. He managed to kick his feet out every single time we wrapped him in it. Maybe we are using it wrong but we can't see any other way to keep his legs inside. And it's kind of awkward having to wrap the top portion around the baby's torso. Overall, just not really worth the money. We are sticking with the swaddlers by Kiddopotamus."
177847,1,This blanket is bigger than all of the other receiving blankets we have. It's great for swaddling a baby that has grown out of the newborn receiving blankets.
127764,1,"I purchased this bed for my daughter who was just over two years old. We had another baby on the way and wanted to transition her from a crib into a ""big girl"" bed before our son arrived. This is the PERFECT transition bed. It sits very low to the ground so it was easy for her to get in and out of bed by herself. The one or two railing option is also a great feature for those that want a little more security when using this as a transition bed!! Our daughter slept wonderfully in the bed from the first night! She is now almost three and still loves sleeping in this bed. The construction quality is also much higher than I expected for the price. I would highly recommend this bed!"
138059,1,My 2.5 son absolutely has fallen in love with his turtle. He loves to turn on all of the different colored lights and changes it on various color settings. He loves the stars that light up the ceiling in the dark. It also helps him to fall asleep on his own at night too. A great buy!
108398,0,"This is a cute potty seat but it's too small. Granted, my 2.5 yo is big for his age (36 pounds, 39 inches) but it's rated for up to 50 pounds. After he sits on it for a few minutes, the foam gets squished all the way down and he ended up sitting on the plastic rims. Secondly, the cup is designed so that the penis goes under it, which works well to avoid overshooting but it's a kind of a pain to pick him up off the potty seat."
150812,0,"I bought this for my teen age son's bedroom to match his new bed and bookcases. We had been trading out for several months and this was the last purchase. I understand now why it is a &#34;stork&#34; brand. It is only sufficient to hold baby clothes. Not very sturdy at all. We have since switched back to his Ponderosa Pine dresser. We had to sand it down and refinish it and attach some new accessories, but it will last many many years more. It lasted 16 years already. So if you are looking for a baby dresser. You found it. If you are looking for something more sturdy, KEEP LOOKING!!!"
123762,2,"I bought this for our 3.5 year old as she is growing out of her toddler seat. I thought with the Eddie Bauer name and the good review of safety by a well known magazine that reviews safety that this would be a great seat. It is not. It doesn't sit in my ford explorer in a way that is comfortable for my kid to sit in the seat. She is sitting leaning back at a weird angle, no matter how i adjust the car seat or the car or the latch. i do think the harness adjustment is hard to use, at least compared to the gracos we had. (had for both baby seat and toddler seat). The cup holders are out of reach for her in a normal seated position --- or as normal as you can get in this thing. My husband and i each need a car seat, so i'll put this one in his car (much less use of it) and i am buying a britax and putting that in my vehicle. i would NOT recommend this seat."
127839,1,This is a Good Monitor. There is still some static and interference but overall a very good monitor. I would like to see some more features incorporated for the price. The one disdain I have for this and the other monitors I have is the Volume. I have to set the volume rather low to keep it from echoing around the house. Though the sensitivity is nice I would rather see better sound quality rather than volume.
94957,1,"When my daughter first started using sippy cups I tried all different brands. I wanted something that was durable and wouldn't leak. Well once I found these cups that was it. She's 4 now and still uses these cups! They come in all different designs for kids of all ages. Both my 4yr old dauthter and my 2yr old nephew only use these cups and we've never had a problem with them. They will wear out after a year or so of use, but then I just buy a few more and we're good to go! Absolutely the best cups for kids that I've used! Highly recommend these to anyone I know."
36953,2,"Before buying this car seat I read the reviews and they were mixed. I want everyone who reads this review to know that I am very SORRY now that I didn't listen to the bad reviews!!!! My reason for buying this seat was that I thought it would last my child throughout the rest of his car seat days, appeared to have a nice color scheme that wouldn't show dirt, it had a cup holder,it had growing room and appeared to be a very safe car seat. All of these are true for the seat, but the down falls out weight the good and I hate this seat because of them. The worst problem is the straps for the harness are always twisted!! I will spend the time taking it appart and making sure they are straight and they take no time to twist again. If you think for a second your seat will be different read some other reviews. Next is that the puzzle piece latch is a very big pain!!! My child is very happy to take rides and gives me no problem staying still while buckling him in, but it is very difficult to get the pieces exactly perfect to get it to latch. I would hate to be the parent who has this seat and their child doesn't like to sit still. Last is I had to wash the fabric of the car seat and it was a very big pain to get it off and back on!! Please do not buy this seat or any seat that has the puzzle piece latch. Please take this advise from a mother who regrets buying this car seat everytime she puts her child in it."
55168,1,"I bought this stroller for my sister, who has a very tall two year old girl and a baby boy. She loves it and raves about great it is every time we talk. The baby sits in the rear seat, which reclines all the way back for naps and the toddler sits in the front. It probably wouldn't be the best stroller for infant twins because only the rear seat reclines. The features she likes most are the massive storage basket underneath the stroller, how easy the stroller is to open and close and how easy it is to push and turn -- it feels light and nimble, considering it's a double stroller with two big kids. It's not perfect, but it really is an exceptional value for the price. (I paid $144.99.)"
38913,1,"A lot of parents told us that this was a must-have, and they were right. It is so easy to bathe our baby with this. We use it with the Evenflo Infant to Toddler baby bath and it fits perfectly. It dries completely in a couple of days (it is still a little damp after just one day). I haven't tried to wash this since I figure it will unbalance the washing machine - it weighs a ton when wet! It really does stay warm and my baby is very comfortable - no tears at bath time!! We plan to travel with this over the holidays - it will be so much easier than lugging the plastic tub with us."
70588,1,My baby is only two weeks but I use it when I need to take a shower. I put him in it and he lays around and looks at things. I would give it a five but I wish it were a bit smaller. It's pretty bulky.
98121,1,"I am glad to see that glass bottles have not totally gone the way of the dinosaurs. Glass bottles make take a little more effort to clean,but they can be used for generation as long as kept clean."
40887,1,These diapers are very good at holding in the liquids and keeping the baby dry. I like them for everything except night time. Our son overloads them at night.
121586,1,"This is our ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears"" story: We started off with a full sized stroller that was part of our travel system, and after six months it was just too big. I couldn't fit in in stores and it was heavy. We then downsized to an umbrella stroller and it was too small. It didn't recline, there was no cup holder and it tipped over when the diaper bag hung on the back. So we found this and it was just right! Its is wonderful with the reclining seat, our daughter can take a nap, and is great with a quick diaper change. The basket is nice and is decent size if you utilize the space under the seat. Its lightweight enough that I only need one hand to lift in and out of the car, and its really quick and easy to open up. Folding it takes a couple tries to get right, but then its no sweat. We recently traveled with this stroller and I was amazed at how much easier it was, having previously traveled with the full size stroller. We've had it for ten months now and I've only noticed it squeaking when it has a lot of bags on the handles. It also fits with our Graco infant car seat, which will be great when we have a second child. I have no complaints! I wish we would have found this stroller first!"
122592,1,"I bought this stroller for my 5 month daughter. She loves it! We take lots of trips and needed somethong that didn't take up all our trunk space. This stroller is so easy to push. I can push it with one hand. Going to the grocery store has never been easier. I am able to zip in and out while shopping through the clothes racks. I am also able to go places ordinary stroller can't. People look at me with envy as I zoom past them with ease! Big strollers are great when your able to take your time and have the space, but if you need space and manuverability this stroller can't be beat. I'll gladly pay the cost and sacrafice later, for the piece of mind that I have a well made product that my child is riding in!"
153334,1,Not a diaper rash on our baby ever.Use this with every diaper change.He's 10 months old and we're still on the original 2 jars we bought way back when.A little bit goes a long way.
163086,0,"I've been using this diaper pail for 15 months. The foot pedal makes it so easy to use. And you can use any trash bag. However, it does not contain the stink. The bad odor fills the room, not just when you open it, but whenever there is a smelly diaper in it. I'm in the market for a new diaper pail."
123002,1,love this product....great for storing milk.. I can fit them in my little cooler with the pump & all. I love the rack too!
141040,0,I used a baby food grinder for my kids so have had alittle experience with it. This one is a little cheaply made but in the long run will hopefully do what we need.
152085,1,"The comfy straps worked pretty well. At the end of the day though one of mine fell out of my shirt. Next time I wear them I will know to occasionally check to make sure they are still in place. If you have a bra strap falling down problem, I would recommend trying a pair."
7831,0,"Ok,When I ordered this item it was not labled ""Fast Flow,"" it was labled ""Medium Flow.""So I was a little suprised when I got a bunch of fast flow nipples for our VentAire Wide bottles.As it turns out, its almost impossible to find Medium flow nipples for the VentAire system.Interestingly, the Playtex DROP-INS Medium nipples DO work with the VentAire Wide bottles, and those are what need if you get the switcharoo like we did.Considering these nipple was drop shipped from Playtex directly (or at least the sole vendor for them), I would have expected to get what I ordered. I do find it VERY odd that they corrected the product after I placed the order. (I have to the emails verifying what I ordered...)So, if you have an older infant can that use rapid nipples and not drown, these are for you. Otherwise, be the DROP-INs medium nipple, and use those. The are IDENTICAL to the VenAire nipples."
94346,2,"On the advice of a friend we selected the Avent system, what a waste! Regardless of how tight the cap was on we still experienced leaks. My major complaints with this system was the gas my daughter suffered while using them, and the hassle of sterilization after each use. As a new mom my time is better spent elsewhere! After two weeks of dealing with the bottles we switched brands."
146179,0,"We bought two bouncers. This one and the Evenflo Exersaucer. My son is now 9 months and a little tall for his age. He is too big for this one, but still comfortably fits in the Exersauser. He also has always liked the toys around the exersauser more, so for a little more money, I think it's worth the investment to get the other one."
182176,1,"The Baby Bjorn is a little more expensive than some competing brands, but it's worth it. First of all, the straps are much easier to adjust and it's quite a bit more comfortable. But more importantly, it is easier to get my daughter in than any of the others which is the big pro. Her head is extremely well supported whether I have her facing in or out. Sometimes it pays to pay a couple extra dollars for certain baby items like a juno baby dvd, woodstock instruments, or a dr. browns bottle set. Other times it certainly does not, however (e.g. bug a boo strollers! come on!)."
79353,1,"Functional and adorable as well--an excellent product! Contrary to one of the reviews I saw, I had no trouble with the suction cup, it worked perfectly. Customer service from Touch of Europe is excellent, too. They are fast and courteous and we've been happy with every purchase. Highly recommended!"
96281,0,"Thought I was buying anoher brand when I picked these up at the store. They are fine for kids to drink out of - my 15 month old loves it. But, as other reviewers have said there are WAY too many parts to clean. Also, it's hard to get the straw back in place. The bottom section of straw can fall off, making it hard for the child to drink. Last, but not least, my little guy tossed one of his on to a cement patio and it cracked the cup - no longer usable. So, I'm going to try another brand to see if they are a little bit easier & more durable."
52546,1,"My daughter is four and a half months old and she loves it!!! The first time I put her in it, I had to put an infant headrest in it, but now she'll sit in forever. She loves the lights and the music and she even knows to pull on the fish to return the music back on after it's over. It's so easy to fold up and take it anywhere. It's a great investment and a good eye and ear stimulator."
181732,1,"My wife and I have two Boppys. My wife uses it while feeding, but it is also a great pillow for propping up our infant so she can see the world around her. We have two kids, and we have used a Boppy with both. Our two-year-old, even likes to use it as a chair. This is a great gift for any new or expecting parent."
131663,1,"This is a great product. The day that I received it, my daughter used it on the potty at home and the next day at grandma's house. She has also used it in store bathrooms. It is very stable and is easy to transport - it folds up neatly. I am very pleased with the product. It is also a great value for the price."
40485,1,this product is much better than other products. i do not have any problem with leaking. my babies (2years and 10 months) can move well and sleep well.
140690,2,I read reviews and some People said Smell like organic something. but I only can smell Cheap Bubble Gum.The lotions okay just don't like smell.
21651,1,"I think the set is beautiful. We purchased just about all of the room pieces to match. I liked it because it was very neutral, boy/girl appropriate, and its not so busy or loud like many other sets out there. We have had the set for 8 months now, and it has worn appropriately. Its been through the wash several times and has not shrunk very much nor torn."
165614,0,"Pampers are the best, softer and better looking that the BJ brand which I used to buy just to save couple bucks until now, amazon got those for even better price and better quality, you can't beat this deal."
54775,1,My son has enjoyed this mobile from the time he was 2 weeks old. He's now 12 weeks old and he is still mesmerized by it for hours. At first he just kind of looked up at it quizzically...now he loves to have conversations with &quot;Froggy Birdy Monkey&quot; and is quiet and happy when it's turned on. Our only concern is what happens when we have to take Froggy Birdy Monkey down!
25694,0,"I tried to use this to support my newborns head but was too bulky and awkward. Her head flopped forward. It may work better when she is a few months old, as I will try it again then. The quality is good and it washes easily."
102219,0,Good concept. But did not hold up to the test of time. Straps to hold in seats gave out. Wheels are suspect and frame has started to rust. Very sad this was not a winner.
150541,1,I highly recommend this product. Great gift and as always came ontime with Amazon.
67841,0,"Our baby is due in a few weeks, so I can only speak on initial set up right now.We got this product because we are committed to co-sleeping, but only have a full bed, which is too small for us to have baby in bed comfortably. This was easy to set up, HOWEVER:1) We have a normal height bed and this does not sit flush with our mattress.2) We bought bed risers from Bed Bath and Beyond, removed the wheels from the sleeper, and placed the co-sleeper on the risers. Seems to have solved problem. (Arms Reach extenders were pricey and I read that they were pretty unstable.) Bed risers were 10 dollars.3) Mattress is extremely hard and seemed of poor quality. We coughed up $130 for the organic mattress, which is better.4) Had to place towels and cardboard underneath mattress to get it to sit flush with the lip that connects to bed. In my opinion, if it's not totally flush and ""one"" with your bed, why even have this product? I would have bought a pack n play or bassinet."
160916,0,"I bought this bag after reading so many great reviews. It is a quality bag and hooks up great to our chicco stroller. My reason for writing this review is to let people know that it is not very big. It looks deceiving. Of course you could read the dimensions but it is hard to picture sometimes without just seeing it. My daughter was born 14 weeks early and so we have many doctor appts. We live 3 hours from the hospital and have to pack for an 8 hour day. I take 2 changes of clothes, three bottles, formula (just enough for 3 bottles), 3 bibs, 2 burp cloths, 5 diapers and small travel pack of wipes and it barely fits. I know it seems like a lot but it compacts down pretty easily. It has a lot of great pockets on the outside but when you put stuff in them it bulks up and takes up the room on the inside. The pockets are great for seperating your stuff but not for extra space. It is a great bag for both mom and dad and good for going to a friends house for a couple hours but i just can't see doing much more than that with this bag. Sad because it is a quality made bag. It just isn't efficient with its space."
141616,1,"My one year old likes to play with this walker, especially wth the phone. She can walk behind it for a few feet and then gets kind of tired, takes a break and goes again. I like the speed setting on the back wheels."
144414,1,"I have used these since my daughter was born, and she's almost two years old. I put several ""pee"" diapers in one bag and seal it up before tossing it in the trash. For poop diapers, I just seal it immediately and toss it. I live in a small house where our trash is inside the house all week. I NEVER smell diaper, thanks to these bags. I love this giant box of them. I wish I had bought them in bulk since day 1. This package is user friendly and compact. I keep the box on the changing table."
179926,1,I wish I had known about this blanket with my daughter! I recently had a son and he is 10x stronger than my daughter was at the same age - a regular little houdini in getting out of even our tightest swaddles. He fights the swaddle so much but sleeps so much better with it that we tried out best to get him to stay put. I found this blanket online and order the green with yellow trim.Positives:1. Lightweight and stretches easily around the baby - cotton fabric is breathable and soft.2. Really works! He has never broken out of this swaddle! The arm mechanisms are genius!Negative:1. It can be hard to adjust the arm flaps and place them under the back but nothing too bad.Positive/Negative:1. Can be both but my little guy constantly kicks out of the leg covering of the swaddle. He usually has one leg in and one leg out. I wish the leg bundle was just a wee bit bigger to accomadate this but it's a nice option to not have to swaddle the legs. We usually wrap a light cotton blanket around the swaddle to further adhere the swaddle to wrap up the leg portion.I honestly love this blanket! I give it 2 thumbs up. The little quirks of it in no way diminish the effectiveness and helpfulness of this blanket. I would recommend it to anyone!
88989,1,I have a 4 month and a 2 year old and pampers baby dry are the only diapers I use.I've tried all different brands and styles but these are by far the best! I never have a leakage problem! I wouldn't use anything else. The price is great when you subscribe to Amazon mom and set up for delivery. I love it because I never have to remember to go to the store to purchase diapers and they always come at the right time. Oh did I mention that it arrives the next day after shipment. Love it! Makes life a lot easier for a mother of two :)
73436,2,"It arrived defective. The display screen did not work. Mailed back for replacement, have yet to receive it. Will revise review once new one arrives."
176341,0,"Although I've been using it for less than a week, I do use it 3 times per day at work. I have the Pump in Style breastpump, but its a bit heavy to carry with all the other things I carry to work (including a laptop) it was just too big. Also, my office is completely opened - everything has windows - including the private offices (if you can call them private) as well as the conference rooms. The only place I can really pump is in the restroom. And although the restroom has outlets, I'm not big on standing out in the open with women walking in and out and anyone being able to look in and see me in the mirror with my breast hanging out. So basically this works well for my situation, so far, because I can hang out in one of the stalls and pump away. The only complaint I really have is that it is pretty noisy and I'm sure it will eat through batteries. I will probably see about investing in some rechargeable batteries and see if that works for me."
152901,1,"This gets the bottle very nice and warm without being too hot for my baby. It works well each and every time if you know what to expect. Here's what to expect- 1. It will take 30min so plan ahead. 2. It will keep it warm for up to 3 hours in the sleeve so you have some leeway on when to click it hot (click the button early!) 3. If you drop it or it is in a bag getting bounced around, it might click on accidentally. It's not the end of the world because it will keep the bottle warm until the baby is hungry. 4. You have to boil it in hot water for 15 min each time after you use it to reset it.I have the Dex Grab and Go and this one. The advantage of this one is that there a handle on this with velcro that keeps the handle together so you can hang it on the stroller or hold it easily. The Dex cover is more malleable and I prefer that one but my nanny prefers this cover. The heating mechanism is a different shape too. This one has a circular part that goes under the bottle too but yet it is not as long as the Dex. All in all, the heating mechanism on this and the Dex one works about the same."
12506,1,"This was a replacement set because the first set I ordered did not come with the correct screws. The screws that were supplied were not long enough to fit into the anchors so we were not able to use the original product that DaVinci sent us. When we ordered the replacement, it too, came with screws that were too short. So instead of packing it up again, we went to the hardware store and got screws that fit. Once we got everything put together, the rails work great. They are sturdy enough for myself, my husband and 4 year old to snuggle in her bed every night while we read a bedtime story. We haven't had any issues with the bed slipping off the supports. Overall a good product, would be excellent if the right screws were included from the get go."
180433,0,"I am not a girlie girl so I thought this bag would be a nice fit for me. I know this is made for men and that is apparent for sure when a buxom broad tries to wear it across the chest like it is designed. I like the style, but it is nowhere near large enough, especially if you have two young ones in diapers. If I bottle fed instead of breast feeding, there is no way I would have room for bottles and formula. I give it a 4 for style, but a 2 for functionality so overall, it is only a 3 star at best."
146570,1,"We got this for our son for Christmas when he was three and a half months old. It was a huge hit right off the bat. He LOVES it. At first, he was tentative in his bouncing, but once he figured out that the more he bounced the more music he got, he became exuberant. It's been only a few weeks but he has already played with every toy -- the animals in the music/lights section, the spinning lizard, the spinning sun, the teether, and the color wheel. It is definitely his favorite toy. Well worth the money."
124083,2,We thought we had a real nice item until it broke after the 2nd use. One of the arms broke loose from the part at the top - and now the cabana is worthless because it can not be set up. I contacted the company and they have yet to reply. Don't waste your money!!!
42998,1,"Even though my child hates being worn, I still love the concept.Pros: Many color choices, once you learn the basic wrap/fold, there's many different ways of wearing Baby, you can hold twins (in one position only, and only at the infant/newborn phase), there's no straps, or clips, it seems like it would fit most people, of different sizes, their website has instructions, and a tutorial on how to wear it. Much, much more supportive than the Baby Bjorn carriers (the Moby goes around your shoulder and back, so the weight is spread out)Con's: HUGE, and I mean HUGE piece of fabric, learning the fold is a bit hard (only at first, but if you think about it, the first time doing something new is a bit daunting). Looking like a Jedi without Baby (just kidding, I would put this on before stepping out of the house, because the fabric is so huge, and I don't want the ends to drag on the floor of the parking lot).I am getting Baby use to this product, because if I don't, my wrists and arms will break off."
144880,0,The strap clasp broke the first time I used it. I contacted the seller and they got a hold of the company...they sent me a replacement strap...WHICH WAS MADE A LOT BETTER!!! No problems since then!
128570,1,I love these bottles! I had planned to go with the more expensive bottles (BPA free cute bug designs and all) but decided to save some money. I love the vintage look of these and I'm so happy I bought them. As a side benefit they are a perfect fit for my Medela [...] pump. The one problem I have is that my son won't take the silicone nipple and I'm having a hard time finding a latex one that will fit the bottle.
39059,1,This is a great cushion for the Svan high chair but the color is not a baby pink like shown in the picture or on the packaging. It is a beautiful warm coral pink.
181714,1,"This cart is exactly what I have been looking for. Sure it isn't super sturdy or pretty but it extremely functional. We don't have a lot of room in our apartment and I wanted something to keep the baby's stuff in one portable spot. I just take out what I need from the baby's closet/dresser and place it in the cart for the next few days or even weeks for quick reach and use. It has plenty of space for onesies, blankets, burp pads, pajamas, diapers etc. It is small enough to store in my small walk in closet for when guests come over and easy to roll out if needed.In addition, I think that the makers redesigned this cart because it was super easy to put together and I had no problems with the holes lining up. The instructions are in pictures and not words so for those who are perceptually challenged, it may be a bit difficult.If I had to change one thing, I could definitely have used six cardboard squares rather than four. But that is easily fixed by using the box it came in to cut out two extra pieces."
84071,0,"I purchased this gate because I wanted one that would ""disappear"" at night. I didn't want to keep running into it. This does that but when it retracts it sometimes wrinkles and and I have to keep adjusting it to retract properly. Also, already after a month the locking mechanism has separated from the soft gate. So far it is easy to put back in place but it does not bode well for years of use. Also, the big drawback is that it really is difficult. My five-year-old CANNOT use it and so must have us lift him over all the time. Nor can any other adult figure it out if they have not read the directions. It took us a few times reading them to get the hang of it too. So, if you want a gate and have older children you might want something easier to open and close."
94257,0,"I liked the idea of these bottles being the closest to the breast and being low air. However, I don't believe they do either very well. Also, I found that they do leak on occasion mostly around the collar. The nipple holes seem to be varying sizes even though all my nipples are newborn. Some seem to pour formula out and some seem like they have no hole at all. My daughter spits up a lot after eating and I can just hear the air bubbles in the bottle as I'm feeding her (I'm holding her correctly and making sure the bottle is tilted). The spit up worries me because when I get her in the morning I can see that she spit up during the night and I worry that she will choke. I'm actually on line trying to find a better bottle for her but figured I'd warn others since these bottles are not cheap. Do yourself a favor and don't invest big bucks like I did. Buy a few different bottles to see whcih one you like best. I wish I had. Oh yeah, I gave it three stars because my daughter doesn't seem to mind them and the wide mouths make them easy to clean."
61957,1,"I noticed that the diaper was ripped along the seams on one side while my son was wearing it. So I took a closer look, as it never happened before. The hole was so big that the diaper almost fell off. Then I went back to check on other new ones and sure enough, all of them have some holes already forming, or almost will tear if I stretch them. So dissappointed with this shipment.UPDATE:I sent an email to Amazon about the defective product, they promptly send an email back and scheduled another shipment right away. Thank you so much. Hope this new shipment doesn't have the same problem."
169133,2,I would say that one out of every three diapers in this package came with faulty tabs that tore during the diaper change. And out of a 234 count package that is a LOT of wasted money and one very pissed off baby whose diaper change now takes three times as long. I'm extremely disappointed and will be trying others.
61731,0,"These diapers look and feel just like the Huggies I normally use, but the sizes are not the same. The size 5 says for 27+ lbs. and they are super snug fit for my 30lb. little guy. By the 3rd one we used I had a leaky mess. These might be fine if they fit properly, but I think they are smaller than other diapers. Wish I had started by trying a single pack rather than a case of 184!"
102587,2,"I love Amazon and Amazon service. I have only great things to say about Amazon! Not so great about this product though.Our first mobile worked and our baby loved it. It really helped to transition her to her crib. About four weeks after we got it, it stopped working. The mobile would not rotate. The music still played and the light worked but not the mobile. The mobile is the most interesting part for little ones. We exchanged it through Amazon (I got a replacement the next day) and it worked for a while... about 7 weeks and then it stopped rotating the same way the first one did. It's out of stock on Amazon so we are receiving a refund instead of an exchange. I am starting to think most of what Fisher Price makes is cheap junk. They won't confirm what their products are made out of and everything seems to come from China. I'll be looking for a better quality crib toy for my little sweetie. I am just happy I got it on Amazon because if I had gotten it at a local toy store or other big box store, I probably would've lost the receipt by now and wouldn't be able to return it."
131251,1,"We got this for my daughter for her 1 year old birthday last week! She absolutely loves it!! She pushes it all over the house! I really like it because I feel like it is helping her learn to walk and teaching her ABC's and numbers. My only complaint is that the little drum that turns as they walk has a motor that is kind of loud. However, that does not seem to bother our little girl a bit! She loves it!"
104518,1,This is by far the best baby gate we've had. This is baby number 7 in our house and we needed a gate that a toddler could not open yet would keep our dog on one side of the gate and allow for the older kids to pass through. It was very easy to install and had worked perfectly ever since. Ours is in a hallway that is 5 feet wide so we did have to install it with an extension. The first one we ordered came bent during shipping and amazon very quickly replaced it. The exchange process was much quicker and easier than I expected. The gate is bright white; nice and shiny. LOVE the quality!!!
116346,1,"Only spent $40 after shipping versus $120 from other places. For the price, you can't go wrong. It is a middle of the road product, but to avoid going between floors, this serves its purposes well and can be used as a bookshelf when no longer needed as a changing station."
88279,1,I highly recommend this product. It is so convienent when you have a stroller that doesn't have a basket. I love the bag and would recommend it to my friends.
2855,0,"And buying the matching cloud slipcover. I love it because as we all know breastmilk stains and washing the pillow isn't easy. With the bare naked boppy you can find alot of slipcovers to go with your child's room and different stores carry different styles and is so much easier to wash than the whole pillow. I have found different slipcovers at Target, Babiesrus, Target and Baby Depot."
79276,1,"I bought this product because The Environmental Working Group's Cosmetic Database only gives it a hazard rating of 2, compared with other diaper rash creams like Desitin which get ratings as terrifying as 6 O.O [...]I also have the California Baby Calendula Cream, rated a 0, and the California Baby shampoo and body wash.This diaper rash cream works just as well if not better than other brands, and I know it's safe for my baby. Just a dab on a diaper rash clears it up over night! I cloth diaper and if my baby is ever sitting in her wet diaper for too long she gets a rash, but it is not very often. If/when it does happen I put on a dab of this stuff and it works like magic :) It is fine to use with cloth diapers, unlike other brands which will leave a stain on cloth.You can buy it at Target or Christmas Tree Shop... so if you have one of those near you don't pay for shipping ;)"
30839,1,good idea but why cant you remove the ice packs? the ice packs are completely unremoveable. if this was not the case i would buy this nice looking bottle holder there are two flat hard plastic ice packs. well made sturdy looking. will it ever need to be washed? well i don't think it will work.
153374,1,We used this for our first child and it very quickly and effectively fixed any redness or diaper rash she ever had.
162221,1,"This is a nice piece of funiture, it was easy to put together in quick time and seems to be very study. I would have given it 5 stars but the finish is easily nicked. Very compatable with the emily crib!"
141300,1,"We have purchased two of these after one was given to a friend (we didn't think we'd have more kids!) and both times our babies have been completely mesmerized. They love the songs, all f the activities and it is very durable. I also really like that the front plate is detachable so you can take it on a car ride. Assembly (and dis-assembly) are very easy so if you want to take it apart and pack it in your luggage to go on a trip, you can-- we've done it! The only down side is that the phone isn't really attached and it is super easy to lose. I wish it was on a cord like the shapes at the top."
69802,1,"We have tried every brand; some leaked from the sides, and others out of the back. Luvs haven't leaked at all. Also, the price is great!"
97204,1,"have been looking for one of these lambs for a very long time,very quick shipping and a great price! this was a present for our little dog, she loves lambs and the baby sounds will be soothing for her! this is a birthday present for our little dog! thanks"
107474,1,"I have avoided a dentist for whitening because I don't want to overly sensitive my already sensitive teeth. But I drink a lot of coffee and tea, and I notice it has an effect on my teeth (which are not white to start with, so don't need to be made worse, ya know?)This has worked for me. I use toothpaste for sensitive teeth most of the time, but about 3 to 5 times a week, I use this system to remove some of the accumulated stains from food/beverages. I notice a difference. It's not a dazzling difference, mind you--you're not gonna look like some movie star. But it's enough that I NOTICE.I've been using it for several months (prior to that I used the Supersmile for four years by itself). It really works better with the bleaching gel. However, I suggest you use slightly less of the bleaching gel (the clear one) or you'll run out too fast. The directions say use equal measures of both, but somehow, I always run out of the bleach before I run out of the toothpaste, even when it looks like I'm using equal measure.I always keep a spare of this system in my bathroom cabinet. I wouldn't do that unless this had some good effect. :)"
34906,1,"We've had hard time deciding what to get for our 9 month old son and finally we bought this one. So far - we love it. It was a little hard to install, but once we levelled it with a folded bathroom rug (use that non-skid back of it!) it was fitting just fine. We placed it rear-facing behind the passenger seat of my Accent (and it's definitely not the largest car out there!)where it seemed to fit best. Once forward-facing we'll put it in the middle.We're going on a trip to Atlanta over the holidays and this is when we'll REALLY test this seat - it's a 5 hour drive:)) But as I said- so far we love it and so does our son:)) The reason we're not buying another one for my hasband's car is because Grandma is getting it for us fo Christmas!"
134532,2,"This canopy came with our Pack `N Play, so we didn't have to purchase it separately. Good thing, or we would've returned it right away!We ultimately purchased the set in hopes of using the canopy along with the bassinet feature (in order to keep our cats from jumping into it). Upon reading the manual, however, we found that the company recommends you do not use the two components together.What's more, as my husband was installing the canopy for the first time, one of the poles easily snapped, and we had to wait several weeks for a replacement from the company. Though we had trouble getting anyone on the phone for days, we finally reached Graco via the Internet, and are glad to report that there was no charge for the replacement part, (...)P>Once the canopy was in place, we could see that the ceiling was fairly low, and though we haven't used it out of doors yet, it seems (especially with the dark-colored backing) that it could get very warm in there quickly. Consequently, they do state this in the manual as well."
82769,1,The little baby isn't due until May so I can't comment other than it is very cute. Delivery was prompt.
132573,1,"We love this diaper pail. The bags are actually one continuous ""tube"". You tie a knot in the bottom to create a bag. Then put the diapers in. Then there's a little cutting tool on the door to cut the top of the bag when it's full. Then you tie another knot in the top of the bag. Very easy and user-friendly. We're happy with it."
156861,1,"My 4 moth old absolutely loves this toy more than anything else that he has. He loves to sit straight up and stand and even though he is a 1/2 inch shorter than most kids his age, his toes can reach the bottom [(on the lowest setting) just enough for him to spin himself around]. The only drawback is that it warns you to not let him stand flat-footed on the bottom of the ultrasaucer, so i folded a blanket and put it underneath him so that his feet can touch the bottom better, without having the interference from the hard plastic grooves on the bottom. I mean I wouldn't want to stand flat-footed on that grooved surface either. I love the fact that the toys are close enough for him to reach them, unlike some others we tested out. I agree with one mom who said that there should be a bar to slide and move toys accross it. Since this one doesn't have that, we bought him the sassy link and rings and we linked them from one toy to another. He really loves that. If u have a tiny love play gym then u can take the hangy toys off of that and attach them to this as well. This saucer also has an empty space where u can put a separate toy on or a binky or a bottle on. The possibilities are endless. We are all very happy with this toy and I know that who ever else buys this toy will be too."
152873,2,I wouldn't ever buy this item - it is a gift that I don't like at all. It took a lot of steps to put together just to find out:&#60;br /&#62;For one it's sounds are very light and you can hardly see or hear them. &#60;br /&#62;The tray cover where the toys are swings open and shut and it pinches my daughters hands.&#60;br /&#62;The low setting doesn't even allow my 25.5&quot; daughter to touch the ground - she's about 4&quot;'s shy. So a child should be about 28-30&quot; tall to use it.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Don't like it. &#60;br /&#62;
14480,1,"I absolutely love ALL Avent products... their bottles, bottle-warmer, pacifiers, etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles, and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one. Yes, sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle, and breaking the seal. So, when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle, take the nipple out of the ring, rinse the nipple and ring, and then the problem's gone. These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me, and haven't discolored with age of anything. (Although, old nipples do discolor.)It's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side... what a pain and mess that must have been!!!"
72392,1,"With My first child I only had a free standing bassinet. It worked great when my baby was sleeping. In the middle of the night when he was sleepless and needed some help, it sure would have been nice to have a cradle that rocked.Now with my second due in a few months, this is a product that I will purchase if I do not receive it as a gift.I still would like the rocking motion on the long sleepless nights."
112364,1,"Hey Everyone,Pampers Diapers, especially cruisers, swaddlers, and baby dry, etc, are on sale, well not advertised sale, but an EVERDAY LOW values type of thing where these diapers go for about $8.49 for a mega/Jumbo pack, and $15.39 for a SUPER Mega pack, in additional you can use manufactured COUPONS to save EVEN MORE $$. It's sad that Amazon does not have the cheapest items for sale anymore..Shame on Amazon..shame shame..tsk tsk."
61686,1,My husband absolutely loved this powder. He is so hard to but fragrances for but this one he loves. He says he likes this better than wearing deodarant or cologne. WINNING!!
163657,1,"I have used this since my granddaughter was old enough to sit on her own. She is now 14 months old. It remains stable, securely attached to a regular dining chair. The adjustable safety straps and have grown with her. It is easy to clean. Truly a worthwhile investment for me."
173313,2,"I got this item, as the manufacturer claimed that there's no risk of interference, has a rechargeable battery (parent unit) which gives it some portability and that the range is great.I had done everything by the book, charged the unit fully before the 1st use.... Since I had issues with the unit after a couple of months of use I called the manufacturer, as I thought that may be the unit I had was defective...Instead I was astounded to hear from one of Graco representatives that... the rechargeable battery isn't supposed to be used on a regular basis (less than 15 minutes per day or so), isn't supposed to last more than a year, (it will cost you $20 to replace it + shipping & handling), and that the battery can only be recharged if the unit is previously turned off!Also, I found out that if someone else is using another set within the range of your unit it is normal that the ""out of range alarm"" goes off (so much about the supposed choice of different channels the unit has). Therefore the alarm keeps on going on and off all the time, a real nuisance, as this occurs any time of the day and/or night!But the real problem and danger this unit can cause is that the alarm supposed to let you know that the parent unit needs to be recharged didn't work after 3 months of use. Which means that if you're not carefully monitoring your monitor it will shut off without any warning, and you won't notice that your baby is awake crying and/or requires immediate care!This item is dangerous, as we parents rely on it when we do our laundry in the basement, have water running when we clean the dishes and can't hear what's happening in the nursery....So do yourself and most importantly do your baby a favor, and do not buy this monitor!"
149997,1,"my daughter loved her tray. we got it for a long trip and it worked wonders. we don't use it for short trips, but only because i don't think about getting it out from the back of the car to strap around her. i would recommend the tray."
102757,2,"I originally registered for this diaper pail because it only requires regular trash bags and I thought it would be both easier and less costly than the ones which require special bags. However, I found that the round ball that is supposed to block in odors kept falling off. It actually fell off into the bag with the diapers and was thrown out one day before we knew it was missing. After that, the pail was useless as it no longer blocked odors. I also found that the lid always closed on my hands whenever I was changing the bag. Needless to say, I now have a different diaper pail."
152240,1,"I purchased this about 2 months ago for my daughter. The capacity is huge. It fits soooooo many toys in it. And, it is very well made. I don't have to worry about the zipper breaking or overstuffing. It has created some order from the craziness that is this 5 yr old girls room. And... she loves to lounge around and jump on it."
107872,0,"I originally gave this pump only 3 stars, but as I am editing, if I could change it, I would give it 5 stars. When I first began using this pump, I hated it! Although I was getting a fair amount of milk, it was extremely painful. But I kept at it, and now it is no longer painful and actually very comfortable. It's easy to assemble, and easy to clean. I've been back at work full time for 3 months now, and up until last week, I was using the Avent pump. I just bought a Playtex Embrace (which I also love). But for any moms out there who are worried about keeping up their supply while working, and who can't afford to buy an expensive pump, the Avent is a great investment. I am pumping the same amount with the Embrace that I did with the Isis. And the total time it takes me is about the same with both the electric and the manual. The only downside with the Isis is that my hand would cramp up from pumping. I would highly recommend this pump. I still use the Isis at home."
41402,1,"We have used Pampers on our son since he was born -- first, the Pampers Swaddlers size N (so soft and tiny!), then the Pampers Swaddlers size 1 (so soft!), then the Pampers Swaddlers size 1-2 (so soft!), then the Pampers Swaddlers size 2 (so soft!), but the Swaddlers ended there (so sad!)...so, we moved on to Pampers Cruisers size 3, and now we are on Pampers Cruisers size 4. I can count on one hand the number of times he has leaked through/blown out of a Pampers diaper. They are great diapers - high quality and good design. Love the cute Sesame Street characters on them, and so does our son. I recommend buying these in [...]- best value. [...]"
172772,2,"I am very disappointed with this tub. I was really excited about it when I saw it in the store and thought it was really what I needed in a baby bath. The shower control is very difficult to handle while giving baby her bath and it only works when it wants to. The water pressure is not very good and the streams of water are very tiny. Also, when the well gets too low it makes it very light and the baby kicks it all over the place. The bath itself is a nice size and I like the sling that she lays on but the shower is more trouble than it's worth! You're better off using a cup!!"
146117,1,I bought the jumperoo for my 8 month old grandson and he loves it. It's great exercise for his legs and there are lots of colorful toys to play with that move and make sounds.
81895,2,"I bought this pump for my second child, I wish I hadn't. It is painful and difficult to use. I got more milk expressing by hand. I never got more than an ounce in 20 mins. I tried adjusting the settings but it never got better. I gave up on this pump after 8 weeks of trying. I wish I had bought a Medela instead. Because of health dept regulations, the store cannot refund for it. So now I have a pump I can't use, and still have to buy a new one."
89946,1,"PaPampers Cruisers, Size 4, Economy Plus Pack, 140 ctI love the Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers. They are soft and comfortable for the baby and they don't leak. I wish they made Swaddlers for older babies too. My daughter grew out of them very quickly. We tried the Pampers Baby Dry and they were not nearly as soft or comfortable, so we went straight to Cruisers. We also tried every other brand out there and found that Pampers really has a superior product."
175993,1,I have been wanting one of these for awhile my baby is a preemie so as soon as he gets a little bit bigger I will use it but its a nice product and the jersey material is really soft.
103050,1,This light ring bathtub is sturdy and has enough space for chubby litte legs.
147502,1,"Using with our first child who is two months old. She liked it right away and takes naps in it and sits in it while we have dinner. Simple, elegant design. Expensive, but worth it."
6678,1,"I am completely happy with the diaper. It fits well, seems comfortable and stretchy for my baby. Have not experienced any diaper leaks. Absorbs well, keeps my baby dry. I love having them delivered to my house!"
47916,0,"Bought this gate as a replacement for ours, the wall brackets broke. I thought this would be great because you can see right through it. While that is a nice feature, it does eliminate the support bar across the middle of the gate and this seems much more unstable and wobbly than our last one did. One nice thing is that this is a taller gate, which is quite helpful with a tall child! It also has snap width adjusters rather than having the old fashion screws like our old one did, which is nice. Overall it is not a bad gate, but I would not suggest using it at the top of stairs. Other than the questionable stability it is a nice gate and the handle is very easy to operate."
78048,0,"I slightly regret purchasing this highchair. The areas where the chair legs join stick out quite far from the chair and are located high up on the chair. She has hit her head on this area several times as I have been securing the straps when putting her into the chair. I have now noticed the leg joints do not stick out so far in other chairs and the joints are not located so close to the area where the child's head will rest.Also, the chair is not well padded. It was sometimes audible when she would bring her head back to rest between bites. I placed a towel between the padding and the chair to alleviate the problem.On a positive note, the highchair has held up well and is easy to clean. The straps are easily adjustable and I know she is safe and secure in the highchair (of course, she is always closely supervised)."
62889,2,"We had this product less than a year before we switched to the diaper champ. It was fine at first before we fed our baby to solids. The smell would leak out. We clean the diaper genie every week. Maybe the reason the smell was quite strong was becuase we just use it for the BM diapers and regulars trash can for the other diapers that way we would not have to constanly buy refills.It's not a bad prouduct, I suggest emptying it out daily. I would strongly reccommend buying the diaper champ keeps out the smell."
7896,1,"We use this on our infant and it smells wonderful and makes his skin so soft! I love that it's organic so you don't have to worry about all those harsh chemicals that most mainstream baby lotions have. Also, it has a rating of 0 on cosmetic database so I feel safe about putting it on baby's skin! Love this stuff!!"
14908,0,"I used these bottles with my first child after weaning him from the breast. They leak unbelievably causing a mess! He still uses his bottle and will not switch to another brand so we are constantly checking and rechecking the seal. Needless to say, we switched to Playtex for our second child and have not had any problems with these botles."
121564,1,"We needed something to put the used kitty litter in so we wouldn't have to go outside to the trash can all the time. This works great. We use the little Sassy bags for diapers, scoop up the litter, and then put the bag in this pail. I put a car deodorizer in the space provided for an air freshener and that works great too. I would give it 5 stars except that the foot pedal doesn't always work though it is easy to lift the lid without it."
69227,1,I purchase these diapers for my grandson. They are comfortable for him and very absorbent.
160702,0,"We were so excited about this product and we got 2 crib sheets, only to find out that since we have a dust ruffle around the crib that we can't use it since it has to snap into the frame of the crib. We are using them as waterproof mattress pads and love them, but it would have been nice to know that ahead of time."
27532,1,"Bought this for a relative's girl who needed some dinnerware of her very own. Mom was tired of using the boy's Spiderman stuff. I'm not into pushing the princess marketing machine over the little ones, so I found this. It's whimsical and girlie enough without being over the top. The plate is sturdy and the included fork and spoon are weighted well and sized right for the toddler in your life."
41631,2,"NOT RECOMMENDED - The monitor itself seems to be good, however one the receivers quit working after about 4 days. I returned the defective system and exchanged it for the same model and the new one had the exact same problem as the original one I returned. After experiencing the problems I have had with the replacement, I will be returning this one and go back to a Fisher Price monitor that will hopefully work better."
99238,1,"My daughter is very petite and it is hard to find diapers and clothes that fit her little bottom securely. Pampers are great for those children who don't have any ""junk in the trunk."" : )"
176675,0,"The warmer always gets 4 oz bottles too warm, no matter how much water you out it. The larger bottles sometimes don't get warm enough. My baby had colic and waiting for the bottles was torture. I gave this unit to charity."
18001,1,This toy is great for babies... what is really nice about it is that you can constantly modify it for continuous entertainment of baby. Everything is removable and you can even add your own toys to it. It is well worth the $50some dollas.
101358,1,"When I first saw this product both online and in the the packaging I saw the shiny material and assumed it was satin which made it look ""cheap"". However when I went back to the store 1 week later and saw a crib set up in this beautiful bedding and felt how thick and soft this set is I loved it and was surprised that the blanket had no satin on this and was very well made. Do not make your decision based on this picture...it is extremely deceptive. Feel/touch the quality fabric and see how truly rich and soft it is and then make your decision after observing it in person. I bought it and love it!"
17992,1,"I love this product. My daughter loves watching the star, and I appreciate that everything is detachable. I will remove the little birds from the play gym and attach them to the handle of her carseat. Keeps her entertained while in the car. It is also fun to remove the star and help her learn to track sound. You can then move the star farther back and help her learn to focus her vision."
99839,1,I am so pleased with Amazon Mom especially with buying diapers. The Pampers economy pack gives plenty of diapers to last me until my next delivery. I love the price.
183484,0,"I used this bag for the better part of the first year of my now 2-year old son. It was small and compact (I don't like giant bags because I can never find things in a hurry and everything is rushed when your child is crying or whining), my husband liked that it wasn't a ""girly bag"", it fit our baby necessities for short trips and was very durable. Durability is most important to me. I know myself; I throw bags around, I'm liable to spill my drink on it, I over pack. My one complaint is that I could not attach it to his umbrella stroller without it tipping over. But, overall, this bag did all for me... That is until my son started growing and demanding snacks and wearing larger clothes and needing toys to entertain him while we were waiting in line. We soon graduated to another canvas bag - a Skip Hop to be exact and in an exciting red, stylish color.Skip Hop Duo - Canvas-Charcoal"
95239,2,"They can't seem to make car bottle warmers that work well. This does get warm, but takes forever to warm the bottle just like any other car warmer. Be prepared for it to take 15 mins or so."
130759,1,"We registered for the Ocean Swing and the Link a doo swing. We received both for shower gifts. The boys immediately loved the mobile. We now have a baby girl and we have passed it on to her. It has held up through a set of triplets and is still going strong for our new baby.Whenever one of my boys were cranky or refused to go to sleep I would place them in the swing. Within 15 minutes, sound asleep. No baby can resist the side to side rocking action. This swing saved me many times when I was reaching the breaking point. This swing gives you those ""If I only had 20 minutes"". I could actually get 45 minutes worth of stuff done.This swing gives you the option of swinging like a cradle or a regular swing. Since we had the other swing we left this one in cradle position.We have triplet boys and one of our boys would only nap in this swing. He refused to sleep anywhere else. He would cry and fuss till he was placed in this swing. We started weaning him off the swing when the weight limit started to draw near. It was a tough challenge but we did it.Not only was the weight limit an issue but as the boys got older, they would drop items over the side and lean over to try to pick them up. This is when we knew it was time to say good bye to our lifesaver.They seem to enjoy the mobile and light show. When they reached about 9 months they would grab for the items above. One of my sons was fascinated with the star and would follow it around and around and would cry when it went behind his head.The tray was a nice size and had a wavy bar with a few beads on it. We would clip link a doo toys on to the bar for more amusement.The swing takes D batteries. Go to BJ's and buy a case. We were going through 4 batteries a week. It may be because this poor little swing only rested at night. Since we had three infants the swing was working all the time. I wish there was an option to plug it in.As the batteries becomes weaker the light show goes first, then the mobile and then the swinging. There is no warning that the batteries are going but you can pick up on if the mobile is not working.The controls are on the top. You can choose various speeds for the swing. You can also choose, Mobile only, Light show only or mobile and lights. Then you can add music too. There is a couple of different sounds and music to choose from.There is a piece of material that holds the legs together and has pockets in the back. The pockets are great for putting burp cloths in. They are not that big for putting toys. They may fit some bottles.The legs do need to be spread apart and placed on a flat surface to get the full cradle swing. It does take up some floor space but can be pulled together and flatten when not in use.For the money this swing is worth it. I would highly recommend any of Fischer Prices dual Swings and Cradles."
100088,1,Like them and the smell of them is great. I send them as baby gifts for 2 time parents!
169271,1,"These have been great, they seem to keep 99.5% of the stuff in.As opposed to the Huggies we tried which just spilled everywhere.In extreme cases, you might get tiny amounts of leakage aroundthe legs. When he was ready for the next size sometime pee wouldget channeled out the top of the diapers when I was breast feeding.But this started only when he was getting too big for the diapers."
179919,1,"My baby was a total Houdini. She was busting out of those swaddleme Velcro swaddlers, and needed to be swaddled to sleep. She hated being put in this thing, but once she was in it, was much happier. And once I got the hang of it, it was pretty quick and painless to get her in. After a few weeks, she started being able to bust her arm out. So I started pinning the top layer of fabric with a safety pin. Dangerous, I know, but did the trick and never came undone. I never got what the leg pocket was for. My baby kicked out of that thingin about 39 seconds every night. I ended up cutting it off and hemming it straight so that I could wrap her the opposite way, because I was concerned about always wrapping her in one direction and the pressure that might put on her little developing body. It is so, so overpriced, but I would pay that again in a heartbeat, even with all the issues."
34042,0,"I've used this bag about four times and it is not proving very durable. The zipper sometimes comes undone and I have to unzip all the way and rezip to re-engage the zipper teeth. Also, there is already a hole in the exterior fabric. The backpack straps are useful when your hands are full and no luggage cart is readily available but I'm not really happy with the purchase."
97578,2,"My daughter loves this potty. But only to take apart and scoot around the bathroom. The main problem is the seat not being latched to the base. It easily moves around and once my daughter noticed this it became a toy that she takes apart and carries into other rooms. She's gone potty a few times on it and when she notices Mom or Dad going potty she'll pull it out and sit on it next to us, but not for long. I tried putting the seat on our toilet and it fits with a bit of sliding around but no way for her to fall in. Perhaps I'll try that for a bit and see how it works out. Oh another thing, the seat has crannies for pee to get stuck in that make it hard to clean. Not a plus."
133093,0,"After reading reviews on all the diapering systems out there I decided to go with the Diaper Dekor Plus because it had the best reviews. I have not had the best luck with it, however.After using it for three months the plastic area that works with the hinge on the lid broke making it impossible to open the top using the foot pedal.As soon as I introduced solids to my daughter's diet (5 months old) the smell began to take over and has only gotten worse by the week. I clean the pail inside and out every couple of weeks using kitchen wipes meant to kill bacteria. I also spray the pail with Lysol every time I empty a bag. I've learned not to wait for a full bag. I empty it every day or two depending on how many poopy diapers there are.After about 9 months of use the first inner flap failed to close. A month later the other flap failed. Needless to say, the flaps were a good idea but failed miserably.With much disappointment my husband and I have decided to throw the thing out and buy an inexpensive can that we can use with regular trash bags. If and when the pail begins to smell, we'll just throw it out, too. At least we'll be throwing out a cheap pail and not an expensive one."
165829,2,"I can't even begin to count the number of times I have been nursing my baby in the middle of the night and he has wet through his Pampers Dry diaper and it has gone all over me!!! These diapers are horrendous!!!! The only reason I used them last night was because I ran out of Huggies Overnites. I will never use them again!!!! I have been up since 4:15 because after I had to change my son's diaper and my clothes - he is now wide awake!!! Come up with a better night time diaper, Pampers!!! I'm going to the store to buy more Huggies as soon as my husband wakes up!!!!"
159538,1,My son has colic and loves this bouncer we put the vibration on and he thinks he's in the car and doses right off to sleep. We put the music on low to so it helps soothe him to sleep. When he's awake he likes kicking and moving his arms so the seat bounces. Great product...The Fisher-Price Aquarium products are cute and they really soothe the baby...I have almost all of the Aquarium products...
155226,2,"I agree with the other reviews that say it takes a while to put up because it's difficult to adjust to the correct width and lock into place. I also have the problem of not having perfectly parallel walls so that the gate does not make contact at all 4 points. I thought originally that not having to install hardware would be nice and we could move the gate from one doorway to another throughout the day as needed, but the gate is difficult to use and not very sturdy and thus useless."
4180,1,"With twins coming in February, I wanted to give my husband a baby-related gift this Christmas. This camo Skip Hop bag was the perfect gift. It's masculine and functional. My husband is very happy he won't have to carry around a girly diaper bag once the twins arrive."
72107,1,Hi. I think this carrier is too cute. I have the Chou Chou bouncy seat that has the same design on it. It's great. Any child would enjoy carrying their Chou Chou doll or another doll with them. I hope whoever buys this will be happy.
166252,1,"We used these for our older son and our now using them again. We feel like they have less of a &#34;pee&#34; smell than some of the other brands. (Sorry that is gross, but there is no other way to say it!) Good absorbency, soft, reliable."
1718,1,I have been using pampers swaddlers for my son when he was a newborn. I love it! He is almost seven months now and we are using pampers baby dry. It works great! It is reasonably price. I love the convenience of ordering online from Amazon and the free shipping that goes with it.
75065,1,very spacious unlike many diaper bags I looked at. I reviewed this one prior to purchase and many were happy. It's rare to find functionality and a look of sophistication. I either found one or the other but in this bag I found both. I also like that it gender friendly.
129830,2,"The description is deceiving. The price was attractive which is why we went with it, and there was no indication that it would not work with any snugride infant seat. However, we realized that we were wrong. We have a Graco Chadwick infant car seat and this base does not work. I wish I had done more research before purchasing. Please update the description so other people don't make this same mistake."
117936,1,"This kel-Gar Stroll'r is really helpfull, it helps me with my handbag a lot and with my keys"
21907,0,"I was excited to get a bowl for my son that would stay put on his high chair tray, however it doesn't. It is a nice bowl, but for the most part it is just a bowl, the suction doesn't work very well. I understand it not working on the high chair tray, but it doesn't even stay put very well on the couter top. Cut ebowl, love that is had a lid, but suction cup feature doesn't work!"
57618,1,I purchased this neck pillow for my 2.5 year old daughter. She falls asleep in the car (as most children do) and I wanted a neck pillow to support her neck. I wanted something she would want to wear & not pull off. This pillow definitely did the trick! She loves to wear it and loves the giraffe. It is very soft and does a good job of providing some neck support. Her head does still fall down sometimes but overall I think this pillow does a great job! I would reccommend this product to other moms!
61964,1,These work great but stink already when you open the package. They mustve been 'scented' because they smeeled like theyd already been peed in :( Yuck!
45580,1,"My baby LOVES this gym. He has been playing in it since he was 2 months old (he's 6 months now). It is so versatile, with so much to do: batting, grasping, rolling over, crawling, kicking, sitting, mirrors, lights, music, colors, textures. It is stimulating and entertaining. Great shower gift."
139476,1,"I bought the twilight turtle and sea turtle for my 4 year old son and the ladybug for my 3 year old daughter and they totally LOVE it!! I'm extremely happy with this purchase for it is totally worth every penny!! My son was afraid of the dark and the twilight turtle has totally helped him overcome his fear! We showed everyone the wonderful light display at our Christmas party when it had gotton dark and EVERYONE, especially the adults all wanted one!! Great gift for ALL AGES, even adults!!"
12967,0,"I am using these for pets instead of kids, and they work adequately for my two small chihuahuas who are not into chewing or scratching.The key word is adequately. I picked these up locally for a good price, so I had a chance to know what I was buying. These have a wood frame, and a light plastic mesh. The construction means that your pet can chew his or her way through the mesh.While they work, and I even used this model back when my daughter was small - many years ago, they have their limitations. If you have strips around the bottom of your floor (most of us do), it needs to be positioned above the strip, since the top and the bottom must match exactly. That makes it a bit difficult when I'm trying to rush to get these in place.I enjoy being able to put them away and out of sight when I'm not using them, but if you want something that you are going to use more regularly, I recommendRegalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White. It is all metal construction, and can be left in place, and you open and walk through it. Much easier to use when you have a baby in your arms."
102577,1,"this is a great mobile, my only critique is that the song ends too quickly. my son loves it. almost 3 months old and he stares at it and falls asleep to the music."
77804,0,"We bought this item b/c our son was too big for his baby carrier by 3 months old and he was too small for most other seats. This was OK. He is 8 months now and I don't care for this seat. It is just so upright in the back and since it's all clothy, it has no real support and I don't like that. He always looks so uncomfy. Plus we brought it to go to restaurants but you can't use it (not supposed to) on tables that only have 1 leg or many tables are too thick to attach this too. Just was a waste of money for us. My SIL uses hers still and her daughter is now 19 months old. So to each their own but for us, he likes his booster chair MUCH better and so do we."
95652,1,Product was exactly what we expected. This is a large hammock that holds a lot of animals. It was very easy to set up and is a great spacesaver.
71397,0,"The cover works fine but, may have to wash by hand. Will use the covers as a substitute of the main covers.Thanks"
8340,1,"It is a nice warm knit sheet for the crib. Baby likes it and the colour is as shown. I like light colours so that the child is not distracted by dark colours. The only thing is that it is a little thin in quality of the knit fabric as others had pointed out. But, I am happy with it as it is warm."
121171,0,"I bought this item for my baby before he was born because it looked comfy and was soft. He is now 5 weeks old. He likes the seat fine, but after a few minutes, the vibration and music stop. That is great if you happen to leave it on, but for a baby that is just about to fall asleep, that is not good. When it stops, he starts crying. The blanket that is with it just gets in the way also. This seat is okay, but I am sure that there are better seats for the money! I am not too impressed.UPDATE: My son is now 9 weeks old and we don't even bother to get this out anymore. It cannot keep him entertained. The vibration is so soft that it doesn't do anything. I am sure that there are definitely better deals out there. On the other hand, the papasan swing is GREAT!"
158159,1,"I was looking for something that wasn't too bulky for our nursery/home office and this fit the bill! It's just the right size for a changing table pad on top and enough shelf space for the diapering essentials. The natural finish even matches the glider I bought 10 years ago. Can't beat the price either! Some assembly required, but nothing too onerous."
134969,1,"There were a number of negative reviews on this product, but I couldn't find anything else that met our needs so I decided to give it a try. All in all it has been effective for what we needed it to do which was to prevent our two young girls from going beyond our driveway and for keeping play balls in the yard.Pros:Great color. Visible for us, the kids and other people so they know our kids are out playing.Easy to set up. You insert two tubes at either end of the drive for the gate to fit into. Took all of 5 minutes with a hammer. Easy.Quick. The gate goes easily into the tubes and sets up in 45 seconds.Effective. If you mount it low to the ground (not sure how the other reviewer set it up so that balls would roll under it. this isn't really possible) it will keep your kids in your driveway.Cons:It doesn't always completely retract back into the tube. If you spend more time fiddling with it you can get it to fully retract, but who has time for that? I just retract it as far as it easily goes and then roll up the rest around the unit. Not great, but it works.It is also not a beefy set up. Kids can't lean on it. Your kids could break it if they run into it hard with their bike, and it is low enough that a ball with any bounce can go over it. But again, it depends on what you need.For the price it did what we needed it to do this summer."

41126,0,"Oh Amazon Amazon let me count the ways I love your service. While I think the product is great, it is the service, convenience, efficiency, savvy and unsurpassed understanding of ease of use that makes the Amazon Experience so outstanding.I started out a sceptic on buying ""blind"" and paying by creditcard online. You have converted me and do a phenominal job!Just by the way I went online to a E competitor for a product I never thought you would have. After 20 minutes of trying to pay them with 2 different creditcards and being declinrd on two perfectly valid cards, I realized they were no PAL of mine if it was so hard to PAY.Keep the good values coming and may you never outgrow your fundamentals!"
122134,1,"I got this for my newborn who loved to be held. She had colic very badly and cried all the time. Except when I put her in this! I used the front carrier everyday until she was 3 months old. It was also the only way I could get chores done. My baby would fall asleep, and then, wake up when I tried to take her out of it. At about 3 months, she wanted to look forward, so, I turned her around. She loved it even more. I am going shopping today, and am taking this with me. I also have a ""cleanshopper"" that goes in the cart, but, I think I like this more. I would reccomend this for sure. Also, get a travel swing. Fisher price's Aquarium take along swing is awesome."
94489,2,I have a four month old baby and these bottles are horrible. The leaking seems to be getting worse the more that I use them. I follow the directions and still terrible. I took reviews seriously when I registered should have listened...Good Luck!
139145,1,"My little one liked it very much. I got it for her, when she was 1.5 years old. It's bright, but not too much that it will mess up your sleep. All the colors are well lit. Overall a nice product. Just feels a bit flimsy. So I gave it 4 stars."
89134,1,"Pampers diapers are the best diapers from newborn to toddlers, I've never been disappointed! And subscribe and save has been a lifesaver for this forgetful mom :-)"
61121,1,"It worked for us and we recommend it to all new parents. I can't give it 5 stars, though, because it just seems so wasteful- wrapping plastic in plastic and then putting it in a plastic garbage bag...As a side note, we used the genie religiously and went through a lot of refills until we figured out the best use: only for really stinky diapers! We cut our refill use in half by using a regular pail for wet diapers, and for diapers where flushing the contents was feasible. (I will spare you the specifics of what constitutes flushable content.)"
13878,1,"Its really helpful, hygienic and easy. I really love the design of the drop-ins which perfectly fits the bottle. Really nice. I keep buying it."
50949,1,I purchased this pillow for my beautiful and pregnate wife and she uses it every night - it has been used to prop her up in a seated position while reading in bed - support her growing belly and she has used it to lean back on while in bed. Her only complaint is that neither end is comfortable to use as a pillow - so I tuck her in each night and turn the end by her head away from her(which pushes me away from her)so that she can use her regular pillow.I highly recomend this pillow - My wife didn't use it during her 3rd-4th month(when I bought it) but during her 5th and now 6th month she uses it every night.
11662,0,"Our 5 month old can sit up unassisted, but our non-skid bathtub prevents us from using the infant seats that suction to the bottom of the tub. The Snug Tub is VERY slippery and dangerous for her right now- moreso than just sitting her in the regular tub! We are currently using the infant seat tub placed INSIDE the Snug Tub. Snug Tub will probably be safer and appropriate for her when she is about 8 or 9 months old."
98018,2,"I started nursing my baby and had to switch to formula, so I tried these bottles. My baby seemed to be spitting up quite a bit, so I thought they would help. I read the instructions and followed them to a T. My baby couldn't get anything out of the bottle, so I tried myself. The baby (or you) have to &amp;quot;bite&amp;quot; the end of the nipple to release fluid. I called Playtex, and they said that to make the nipple work, your baby should only use the tip of the nipple, not the rounded area closest to the bottle.To me, this is a little backwards, since I just spent all this time teaching my newborn not to take just the end of the nipple. I'm not quite sure how you teach a 5-week old baby to &amp;quot;bite!&amp;quot;Needless to say, if your baby has nursed, it may be hard for him to figure these out. I simply use other bottle nipples with the bottles I couldn't return."
151572,0,"Such a great idea, but way too many problems. What you will receive will look nothing like the picture. There is not enough fabric to fasten around the pillow. In the picture it fastens well underneath, the buttons are actually right on the seam, making it next to imossible to fasten as well as the fabric does not lay flat and the seam is up too high on the pillow creating fabric problems.The plastic buttons are very cheap, and pop open way too easily. If by a miracle I can actually get the pillow done up, over the next day, the buttons all pop open.I also agree with an earlier review that the fabric constantly bunches and rolls, creating both a uncomfortable sleeping surface, as well as a danger for infants that reuire a smooth, firm surface to sleep on.Could be fantastic if improved on.Also, customer service from humanity organics is horrible. I hav been trying to get some help on my issues and have never received any response. I have been trying to contact them for a year now."
47120,2,"I hope to give a balanced review. You can already see that the vast majority of 4 and 5 star reviewers think this is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing but not stop raves! But there are definitely some shortcomings to this Joovy product. But one warning before you keep reading, due to our living situation (foreign country off the beaten track) we weren't able to test out a lot of other makes and models so we relied on reviews alone for our purchase. So when people do rave about the ultralight compared to other products, I can't comment on that since we have nothing to compare to, so maybe in comparison to those other product the Ultralight IS the best one out there- but it's still not perfect and definitely has design flaws that could be improved.POSITIVES: It is certainly light, my wife could pick it up and place it into the trunk of a care by herself and she is not a particularly tall or big woman. The simple design is nice and it is quite functional. The back-to-back layout is nice and keeps it narrow and allows us to get in and out of doors, subway turnstiles, crowded areas where a side-by-side would be impossible. The sunshade is thick so it actually blocks out the sun, unlike other strollers where the thin shade seems almost cosmetic.NEGATIVES: Unlike other users, I did NOT find that the stroller was easy to assemble. It definitely does not ""roll out of the box after just putting on the wheels"" as one reviewer puts it. There are pins, washers and other small pieces that need to be assembled to put on the wheels in addition to the tray and sunshade. Complicated? No. But certainly not ready to use without some work and some basic assembly skills. I do agree with some of the other 3&2 star reviews that said it was hard to make sharp turns, I did not find that it could ""turn on a dime"" like someone else said. Also I found that the stroller couldn't clear any curb or edge higher than about 1/2"" without me or my wife having to tilt the stroller back, an effort when both kids are in the stroller. We live in a crowded city so maybe in a stroller friendly suburb this would be a big issue. As someone else put it, it is a little long so anyone who relies on taxi's or has anything smaller than a full-size car (like a Honda Accord) may find it difficult to put the stroller in the trunk.But my THREE biggest gripes are:1. To collapse the stroller you need to pull the red triggers on BOTH the right and left switches at the same time. So no holding a bag of groceries or trying to open a door, you need both hands free. Again I have not been able to compare this to other double strollers, but back when we only had one child, we had 2 single strollers, both had mechanism that allowed us to fold/collapse the stroller with just one hand. Even after you pull both triggers we found that the stroller doesn't collapse smoothly unless everything is in just the right position (like the sun shade). Anything just slight off and the stroller is a unmanageable halfway open mess!2. Though not often pictured in the ads, the carseat is attached to the holder by a red strap. Yes, it does not use the carseat's locking mechanism (if you have a Graco) but is strapped in. Even with the strap on tight I found the seat a little precariously fastened. And again, unless you put the seat in exactly the same way and same position the strap will either be too tight or not tight enough.3. As with a lot of the other 1,2,3 star reviews I definitely confirm that when using the carseat attachment, the older child's seat back is tilted awkwardly FORWARD (about 60 degrees as opposed to vertical 90 degrees), forcing him/her to have to lean forward and not have any back support. If they're (the older child) willing to stand for the whole trip, no problem. But if they have to sit, my son finds it very uncomfortable and usually refused to do it. There is a non-endorsed, unofficial alternate set up (in another review) that solves this problem but it's not as safe for the carseat. We felt this totally defeated the purpose of getting a double stroller that really doesn't allow the older child to sit comfortable if using a carseat. Now if you're dealing with two older children not using the carseat attachment that may be OK. You may also notice that the vast majority of Joovy ads show the second child always smiling and standing up, probably because, even with models and professional photographers they still can't make the second child look like they're sitting comfortably!Conclusions: My wife finds it VERY tough to use this stroller by herself with the two kids, tough to push and turn, tough to fold and tough to strap in the carseat buckles. When the carseat is in my older son doesn't like to sit in the back. The reason we went with the ultralight, as opposed to a more expensive, heavier brand was that we wanted something light and easy to use that she could use when I'm not around. All the 4&5 star reviews seemed to say that this was the perfect product for that. But she absolutely has a tough time by herself and even when I'm here I find it annoying and cumbersome. In fact, the vast majority of the time if we're both here, we've reverted to using our old umbrella stroller for our son and the Grace carseat stroller frame as the stroller for our baby....In terms of the carseat strap/attachment and the folding mechanism and sitting arrangements, I stand by what I say and advise caution and at the very least to try it out yourself before buying if you can. Otherwise, for people who have larger cars, who's kids are a bit older (and don't need to use the carseat attachment) and have more wide open, stroller friendly living situations this may be a great product. Plus, who know's? Maybe compared to those other brands the Joovy Ultrasound IS the best one (I can't say), but from our experience it definitely misses the mark in terms of it's supposed niche and market: NOT easy to use and NOT super maneuverable and NOT the best option if one child is in a carseat."
17655,1,"The canopy is a joke, but I mostly use this for quick trips to the store with minimal outdoor time or at the airport so I wont deduct a point for the canopy. If you plan to use this outdoors a lot, consider getting an add on canopy product of some sort.Putting on the pieces for the 5 point harness is a little annoying(but I think they wanted to leave the option to use this as a 3 point harness at some point)Once you get past those 2 items, these are the things i like.1)The seat looks comfortable, and there is adequate back support (I don't see slouching when the passenger is in it).2)The fold/unfold mechanism is straight forward.3)It is light enough that I can carry my child in one had the stroller in the other to climb stairs when the elevator is not easy to find. It is heavier than the regular fabric umbrella stroller but it is a fair trade off to get a sturdy stroller with the higher weight limit. Has a convenient carry handle when folded.4)I can clip the diaper bag comfortably on the handles, without affecting the balance. Also comes with a decent under basket.5)It reclines almost flat, so you can change diapers on it, if you had to.I guess a kid can sleep in it with the recline, but we have not been out long enough to try that out.6)Handles are high enough for a 6ft parent to push and the frame is easy to steer with one hand.7)The spitfire is very aesthetically pleasing.If you are in the market for a good UMBRELLA stroller, you have found your product.Give it a try before buying a ""full"" size stroller and depending on your life style, it might be the only stroller you need."
7668,1,"I have been using this soap for about 2 months now. It is great for all parts of the body, including the face. I am 47 years old and have had acne problems at my age! It has actually helped. When you apply moisturizer after bathing, it really soaks in and leaves your skin so soft. It also doesn't dissapate real fast like other soaps and lasts a long time. The larage bars I have are only half used and I use it every day."
67526,1,I definately enjoy this hamper. You don't have to drag the whole thing to the washing machine because it has a removable liner. It holds quite a lot of clothing and the design is very adorable. I do recommend this item.
166919,1,Very cute hanging on the wall! Looks great with the rest of the set. I recommend the entire set.
72680,0,"So far so good, I have just stared transitioning my son to sippy cups so we don't really have a favorite yet. I haven't had any issues with leaks and we used the Born Free bottles so I was prepared for the multiple parts. I did however recieve a pink cup. I know I was taking my chances with the ""colors may vary"" but I thought I had a decent chance of getting a gender neutral color...guess not. If it turs out he loves this cup guess I'll just have to buy some at the store so we don't end up with a ton of pink cups!"
120155,1,"I really like these wipes because I can pump wherever, whenever and not need to have to be near a sink in order to wash my pump afterwards. Then I can reuse the pump if I'm still out! I've done some reading about them just to make sure they are completely safe and don't need rinsing or anything, and they are. I just keep them in my diaper bag so they are always handy."
125844,2,"I wanted to save $4 and ended up with leaky diapers 2 days in a row. Also, the tabs ripped on 2 diapers when I was putting them on my daughter. I used to think Pampers and Huggies were comparable but forget it. Pampers are just so much better. Maybe it's my chid's shape etc., I don't know, but I even tried the overnights and she leaked. I'm just not happy with the Huggies experience."
158752,1,"I am very pleased with this sleep sack. Great for summer. I put my daughter in a long sleeved onsie or jammies. I got two medium size, because I read other reviews that said the sizes are big. They are a little long on my 6mo old and she's very long. That way there's some room to grow!"
97864,2,I used these bottles for my son and when you wash them you have to take out the plastic thing to clean it..Well if you don't put that plastic thing in just perfectly it WELL leak..So it would always be leaking when I would pour the formula into the bottle..
164918,1,Having discovered ordering diapers thru Amanzon.com I have highly recommended it personally to new mothers in my area. Not only do you not have to go to the store to get them but the mailman brings them to the door with free shipping and no tax. Much cheaper than I have found here.
106451,1,"Before the birth of my first child, I bought the Diaper Genie and HATED IT! It held a *minimal* amount of diapers, it did NOT contain odors, and needed special bags (which were difficult to cut and remove). After approximately 2 months, I bought the Diaper Champ(!) &amp; I LOVE IT. It is now my staple baby shower gift for all my prego-friends! It is SO simple to use, holds MANY diapers, uses regular kitchen garbage bags (or even plastic grocery bags!), and NEVER smells. I cannot say enough about it - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
152315,0,I have not found any problems with the vibration unit.... my 10 week old baby would not sleep in her crib.. and this has really made her sleep well .
6751,1,"This item WAS a great deal until Amazon eliminated the subscription opportunity. Save $8 at Toys-R-Us! Stock up and save.However, Swaddlers and Cruisers are definitely the best diapers available on the market!"
56808,1,"I bought a different brand potty chair for my toddler, and returned it before I used it because it had so many parts, I couldn't easily pick it up and move it. I got this seat in exchange and my son and I both love it. The high back makes it easy to move with one hand, which I do more than I expected to. My son also likes the high back because he can lean against it and he uses the arm rests to help him stand up without tipping into the guard. The lip on the guard makes it very easy to lift and empty into the toilet, and because the whole potty is so smooth, it is easy to keep clean. I got this when my son was 15 months old, and our only trouble was that at that time, it was a little too high for him to sit without help on because the guard was in the way. But he wasn't ready to use it then anyway, and by the time he was about 18 months (average height), he had grown enough that it was easy to use. He just turned two and still seems to have room to grow."
5385,1,One of my valves stopped working in my daughter's Playtex sippy cup and it was great to find these replacement valves at such a low cost so I didn't have to go out and buy a whole new cup. They work just as well as the one that came with the sippy cup and I am happy with the purchase.
32056,1,"My son liked the nuk nipples and that's all he would use. This design is even better than the first because his mouth doesnt cover the entire nipple. This is the newer version of the nuk nipple, they kept it the same shape which is GREAT but they made sure it fits so that you could switch back and forth between the bottle and breatsfeeding. I highly recommend this product!"
146951,2,"I hope it is non-toxic because my 8 month old twins think this is the best teether in town. They quickly figured out how to take the edges apart. It IS a dust magnet. And if you have a spitter ... there are plenty of cracks to catch the barf and drool. So obviously there are many design flaws with this mat. But did I return it? No. Because I can not live with the alternatives for life with pre-crawlers on hardwoods. They already chewed on the throw rug ... worse evil. Those ABC mats are hideous and spending hundreds on gym quality crash mats in some awful royal blue was not going to work for me... So I have a BIG TUB of wipes next to it and I just clean it when I see it (crumbs, kitty hair, slobber and all sorts of other goobers.) Because we live on it most of the day, I just wipe baby, wipe mat. Wipe baby, wipe mat. With twins you get used to it - ha ha. Good grief baby companies ... it is SO obvious that we need a good product for the new style of living in a great room on hardwoods. Can I get some investors on it pronto?"
77350,1,It is perfect and exactly what I want. Yes I recommend this product for everyone who like to relax while his baby awake.
105169,1,"This product is great! I have not had any problems with it at all. No odor, one handed operation, and I have not had to buy any bags since I purchased a large roll of generic garbage bags five months ago when my daughter was born. I still have half a roll of bags to go. All of my friends with diaper genies wish they had my Diaper Champ. They are spending so much money on bag refills."
152068,1,"Seems to work and I have tried alot more expensive brands that do nothing. I will try another bottle and see, so far so good."
132795,1,With my first child we used the Diaper Genie. It wasn't worth the money we spent. It didn't work correctly half the time and did not contain odors. The Diaper Dekor is very easy to use and the odor problem this time is nonexistent. I've recommend it to 4 of my friends who are expecting.
29460,0,"If you want a fuller looking valance like what is shown in the picture, you should buy two. I only purchased one, but did not go to buy another only because the color doesn't match my daughter's room like I would like. I put it up and will leave it until I find exactly what I am looking for - so it is good for the time being. Had it been more expensive, I would have returned it. I give 3 stars because I don't feel like the material is that great - but what should I have expected for the price? You get what you pay for and maybe if there were two hanging, it wouldn't look as cheap."
146275,1,"My 11 month old is learning how to walk and has been mobile for months but she still loves the jumperoo. We don't use it every day anymore because I save it for a special treat (aka when I really need for her to be confined!). She's about to reach the weight limit, and I will be sad when we have to put it away until baby #2 comes along. Great toy... we've used it for 7 months and I have never had to change the batteries."
135356,1,"Although the picture is a little hard to see, this is a really gorgeous diaper stacker. It is delicate and sweet, and also very well made. Perfect for a new little baby's room. I would definitely buy this again and it would make a great gift."
4824,1,"My daughter had a mystery rash for months. The pediatrician told me to keep using diaper ointment but no relief was ever found. That is, until I switched to these diapers. Within two days of switching the rash disappeared!!! All mainstream diapers (Pampers, Huggies, etc) use chlorine in their production. That's right, they're using bleach. It is also found in the wipes. Please support this product. Its the only one like it on the market. Only the most gentle materials and substances should be on our children!!"
112802,0,my mistake...picture was a three piece set and shame on me for not reading that it was only a mug and bowl set
50147,0,"I bought this product based on my experience with prevoius Evenflo products. As long as materials and finishing the quality is there. Nevertheless the design is troublesome, specially for the baby. When i seated my son with his back against my chest the top edge of the carrying ""harness"" was against his face making it very uncomfortable for him. I tryed the three vertical adjustments to fix the problem without success, the only position to keep the baby was face to face."
17338,2,Could not get it to work where you could see anything but static
63647,1,Great peace of mind to know my grandson has less contact with common germs found on grocery carts. He loves the pictures too.
22980,1,"the design of these diapers conform to our child's active lifestyle. i'm not a big fan of their securing tabs, which don't have as much stretch as Pampers for that snug-tight fit. these don't leak out the sides or back but rather when they reach a certain saturation point, the whole of the diaper feels like a damp cloth. we noticed this when used overnight, so we now use a different diaper for overnight use."
151023,1,"I purchased this changing table in Cherry to match the storkcraft lennox crib that I bought my son. I was a little worried that the stains wouldn't be a exact match but it is perfect. The lennox changing table did not have a drawer and I must say it is worth the extra money for the drawer. The drawer is nice sized and holds lots of diapers which is what I need so I don't have to continually refill the diapers. I am also able to keep several things handy in the drawer like diaper rash cream, thermometer, etc. The changing pad that it comes with is not as thick as I would have expected but it does the job. I tried purchasing a different changing pad and none of them seemed to fit or look right. The changing pad also is plastic on the outside for easy wipe off but unfortunately a bit cold for infants liking. I put washable waterproof pads down to make it warmer.There is a lot of room for changing the baby, my son is now a year old and there is still a lot of room for him and his wipes. It is very sturdy, the shelves are a bit thin but great for placing baby items that tend to be light weight."
69705,0,"I bought this for my son, but theres really not much thats really great about this. the stickers are fun, and so is the little posters. the coloring books arent much, and only two crayons, blue and pink."
21829,2,I expected the blanket to be a lot softer then it is. My new born still sleeps on it so I gave it at least 2 stars. I washed it and combed it out and by the time I was done the blanket looked like it was many years old not to mention it took over an hour to comb. Not worth the price. My sister has same type of blanket and it is much softer. I will try a different brand next time.
79945,2,"I was so excited to get these cups, but the leak like crazy. There are 5 parts to the cup: the cup, the lid, the spout and 2 pieces to the leak proof valve... what a pain! It would be worth it though, if it didn't leak, which it does. I would not recommend this cup, in fact mine are in the goodwill bag."
111394,1,"This product prevented my kid's (&#60; 2 yrs) interest in the electric socket. He used to pull the plugs inserted and try to put them back in, which is very dangerous. I was looking for some plugs where you have to rotate the plug to insert in the socket, but could not find any. I wanted to try this, and it worked fine. You may find some issues with the product. For example, most of the computer monitor plugs, and others come with a strong neck which makes it harder to fit them in there properly. But, I am guessing this is the only product that can offer so much space in there. I saw someone commenting their kid ripped it off. If someone has a kid that purposefully rips things off (who is older than 3 years), then it is not a problem with the product. They should look for a different solution than using products like this."
118495,1,"We use this food mill nearly every day, and our baby loves all the food from bananas to prunes and green beans to cauliflower. The only food that we seem to have problems grinding is millet as it just falls through the holes. We recommend this to any family who wants to feed their baby fresh food."
115828,1,"I gave it a 5 star rating because of the toughness and comfort of this stroller. I would have given it 4.5 stars (if I could) only because of the lack of cargo space. The netting below the seat is a nice feature, it just doesn't fit that much. However, we put a small backpack over the handles against the manufactures recommendations (we must be terrible parents) and made due. Anyway, we bought this to take on a 14+ day multi-destination trip and wanted a stroller that would pack easy yet be comfortable for our 2yr-old. It lived up to expectations. I drove this stroller off the curb (fully loaded with backpack and child) every time we left our hotel in the first week (many times a day) and this thing is still working great. For an umbrella stroller, it seemed to be comfortable as our daughter slept in it many times for full naps while we were out on excursions (the reclining is a nice feature). The stuff sack and carrying strap are handy; the strap can be used on the stroller itself and the bag."
117410,1,"I bought this in anticipation of attending two college reunions in June with my 14 month old. Wasn't sure if there would be highchairs easily available. Although it is a little tedious setting this up on a chair whenever you go somewhere, it is a great portable high chair. It pretty much sits in the basket of our stroller for when we are out and about (we live in a city). It has been great at restaurants when all the high chairs are in use! The one other drawback to it is your kid is basically at eye level with the table, unlike in a high chair. We have a very tall toddler so it is not a huge deal but if you have a little peanut they might feel kind of distanced from the action.But a great travel item, for sure!"
64480,2,"THis gate sounds great, you can step over it and it installs easily. But the pressure isn't great and it often needs to be re-installed. You have to bend over to open pet door, not good if you have back problems. THe latch pinches your fingers (and your childs'!) Ouch. And the darn thing fell apart on me. This was a waste of money. Made in china quality!"
115992,1,"This cream is great, i needed the lanolin at first, but this cream is great for later use and is better to keep in the baby bag because it is not as greasy as lanolin and doesn't stick to your hands like crazy."
86856,1,"I've ysed these bottles for both of my daughters (they were both nursed as well as switching between the two didn't phase them) and woill use them for my baby boy due in June. I've read the other reviews and I can't believe the problems some have had with the liners. These things are so easy! The only time I've ever had the liners leak while ""burping"" the bottle is if I accidentally put the liner in a little crooked and ring didn't seal right. Also, I never had a hard time getting 8 oz. in., though I pre-mixed my formula each day so I had a container in the fridge and would pour it right into the bottles. I think some may be trying to mix 8 oz. directly into the bottle. I agree, that would be difficult with these bottles because when you mix formula, you always get a little extra and there really isn't a lot of extra room at the top. Also, mixing powdered formula in these liners is not easy, because they are soft. To get a proper mix, you really need a container that is tough so that you can stir or shake it effectively. Another thing others brought up was that it was hard to see what was left in the bottle because the air is out. If you really have to know how much yopur baby took, just unscrew the ring a little to let the air back into the bottle and you'll see how much is left! Yes, you'll have to get the air out again, but it really takes about 10 second to get the air out, not a big deal. All that aside, I really love this product. My mom used them with me and I really feel that for us, they worked very well. No bottles to sterilize and everything else washes up well with hot soapy water. As a mom who both nursed and used bottles, these nipples are way better than Avent. Avents are very long and almost always gagged my newborn (they tried to push these in the hospital). To sum up, these bottles worked really well for us, the convenience of the drop ins was great and I loved being able to get all the air out for my kids. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that I agree it is hard to mix a powdered formula directly in the liner, as it just doesn't shake up very well due to it's soft material. Hope this review was helpful!"
171298,1,We bought this item for my baby. He is so used to it and feel more happy when we are taking him into the tub.
168709,1,diaper rarely leaks. at first wanted to use Gdiapers only but they leak too much so now use them during the day at home only. Swaddlers I use for overnight and travel. great diapers -too bad not eco friendly.
42922,0,I have not been successful at figuring out how this wrap works. I got it a while ago and it is just too much fabric and wrapping for my needs. I needed something quick and more user friendly I know some people that are successful at it so maybe it's just me but it just didn't work out. Great idea though. I am going to borrow my friends K'Tan and see if that works better for me.
17689,1,"I really like this stroller with the exception the canopy falls off fairly easily. But really easy to push, light and doesn't get hung up when you are trying to get around doors."
9061,2,If I could give this piece of junk a zero I would! Just buy yourself a small boombox and place it near the crib and save your money. We purchased this and returned/exchanged it 3 times just hoping that it was a fluke.1. Sound level is Way wAy waY too low2. Sucks batteries down like a cheap hooker and then getting to the compartment just to switch them out is like fort knox3. Skips on just the smallest of scratches or bumps4. Over priced5. The cover that closes over the cd hardly opens. The first time when I tried to get it open (just enough to get my hand in) it snapped off.
33105,1,"I ordered these after 2 weeks of frustration trying to get my son to latch onto my one flat nipple (the other side is normal). The doctor and lactation specialists said I didn't need these, to just pump to help draw out the nipple and keep trying. I wish I hadn't listened to them because within 5 days of wearing these, he was latching on regularly with no issues, and within 2 weeks was no longer showing any nipple preference between the two sides! (Since I was also pumping that may have sped up the process.) I did give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it looks weird when wearing it, I definitely wouldn't have left the house in it. And second, it leaks a lot if you're not careful--I wouldn't realize how much milk was in it (the foam pads are not very helpful unless you only have a tiny bit of milk coming out) and then it would spill all over me from the air holes when I shifted. However, that ""wasted"" milk was completely worth it to me since I can now nurse from both sides with no problems. I just wish I had gotten them earlier!"
118856,1,"The directions were really bad, finally I just put it together by sight. The chair is and works as expected. Delivery as was stated when we purchased."
87054,1,These are easy to use and they protect my expensive leather seats. I use these protectors when transporting my grandchildren around. When I bought a Cadillac with leather seats my wife reminded me that I would be required to carry the grandkids on occasion. Appaled I looked around for something to save my seats from damage. I found these on Amazon and bought two. They accomplish the task very nicely.
141980,1,My son was chewing the paint and wood off his crib rail. This product gave him something safe to chew on and protects the crib. It took 5 minutes to install if that. I'm very happy I bought it.
84808,1,"Either way the ones they are selling here seem to be the standard ones that are pictured not DropIns as the Title says. Dropins cost more for the amount you are getting. Standard liners are not hard to use. You just stretch them around the bottle top, hold on to them, and carefully fill them. We left the tabs on the bag that they say to remove because my son never noticed them and they seemed to hold the bag on better. Unfortunately you can't mix the formula in them because its hard to measure correctly where as you can pretty well with the dropins. Standard liners though stay air free better than the Dropins. Way better. Also we didn't buy the Playtex dropins, the store brand was cheaper and just as good."
78624,1,"So cheap, so durable, so perfect, so easy. It was worth every penny. I used it with my cosco Scerena and Tumi bag. We did not even bring a stroller. This was perfect. She loved riding in it. I almost bought an$80 one and so glad i didn't. We wouldnt had enough hands to pull everything. Highly recommend it!"
118715,1,"It took no time to figure out how to use this seat. My daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements, so I am moving here from a 5 point harness Britax to this booster in a second car. The seat is easy to install and remove, and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding. I can definately see using it for travel on planes, as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry. My daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water. They are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat. Highly recommended."
162324,1,"I researched for awhile which set is best for me and fits my needs the best. This is my third baby and I found that this and the &quot;deluxe Grooming Set&quot; work just perfect. They contain EVERYTHING that i have found to need and isnt filled with things i will never use just to drive up the price. The quality seems good, but i havent used the theromoter in the other set so i cant comment on that. I would recomend to any new mom this and the &quot;Deluxe Grooming Set&quot;"
166163,1,"The Pampers Baby Dry Diapers are great. If any mom's out their have a little one who screams the minute the pamper is soiled then this is a must have. The dry protection is so great my little 3 month old can sleep 8-9 hrs straight through the night with out a change. Plus I love the straight to my door process from Amazon mom, it is one less thing I have to worry about and can spend more time with my little one."
166162,1,I have not had an issue with the baby dry diapers. i have been using them for my baby since she was born and I don't think I would switch to an another brand. I have tried seventh generation and huggies but pampers works best for me.
127242,2,Unfortunately we had to send this item back as the tray didn't snap in and the seat didn't adjust to all three levels (only 2) as promised. On a good note - Amazon was fantastic about handling the return and getting a shipping refund back to us right away.
129021,1,"Now on my second one. First one lasted about 3 years, not bad considering the price. Yes, one must learn how to push the button lightly if you have high water pressure, otherwise it will blast. The 'blast' is great for a sluggish toilet. I used to drag the garden hose in, now that the gov't governs your toilet, those small tanks just do not have enough water flow to keep drains open. End result, of course, is use of more water than the old larger tanks. Hard to beat a 2-n-1 or dual duty product."
162554,2,"I had this bath tub for my daughter and had problems with it each time I used it. The fold-up concept is great, but as the baby moves the water in the tub sloshes around, seeps out of the hinged areas of the tub, and gets all over your counter. In order to prevent this problem, you have to put so little water in the tub, your baby will hardly get wet. Also, the pad on mine came unstuck. I called the company and they replaced it but the same thing happened that time. I would think twice before purchasing this tub. If space is really a concern for you, perhaps you can overlook all of its downfalls. I purchased a different tub when my son was born and although it takes up more storage space, I love it!"
23784,0,"Pros:Love the table attachment idea - so much easier to clean under the seat this way, instead of having to move a heavy-duty free-standing high chair after each feeding (if you've got wood floors you do not want to have to subject your floors to this over and over each day).The padding for the seat is removeable and vinyl-wrapped and wipes easily.Seat comes out of the washing machine without a trace of food or staining.Works on tables with aprons.Is very secure. Never worry about it coming loose.Cons:The buckle does not release easily - frustrating baby even more when they are crying to get out.Washing is such a pain you'll only want to do once a week even though you have to live with a sloppy chair, because they don't wipe clean either. When you have to dismount the chair from the table, remove the two arms of the seat after you get those pop-out pins that you can't use your own fingers to push them in far enough to cooperate with you(there are two pins on each arm), then you have to grapple with the seat to pull it off the back support that has foam on it which is there to pad the metal bar so baby's head won't get hurt, only it also acts as a grip that ends up making you wrestle and struggle to take the seat off too. Then you wash it and hang it - hopefully it dries before you really need it again. And then it's the reverse process to put it back into working order. AYE! Honestly, this takes 3 minutes to disassemble once you get the hang of it. But it really is overly cumbersome to deal with just to get it clean.The seat does not wipe off! Come on guys, if you're going to have a chair that is so difficult to get to the washing machine, at least make it easy to wipe off. Babies mess up their seat EVERY time they eat, you've got to make these things easy to wipe down.Bottom-line.I'm keeping the seat because it is so sturdy and makes keeping my wood floors clean an easy task. But I am going to look into getting a seat cover, or making one that is easier to dismantle so I can have a clean seat after each meal.Suggestion:Get a vinyl tablecloth or large placemat for that side of the table. Food gets stuck to the table really quickly and under the arms of the top grips, plus babies bang their spoons and cups on it (not good for wood tables)."
124343,2,"I'm not entirely sure why they don't work, I just know they don't serve their intended purpose. I fixed them to my toilets and was able to open the lid with them &#34;locked.&#34; My 15 month old son could do it too. Plus, because of the design, this lock will get pretty gross, as part of the mechanism sits inside the toilet."
46004,1,"My baby loves this mobile at ten weeks old. I just have to stand next to it and talk to him about it. Thats not a problem, unless I have to go do something. If it had a motor, it may hold his attention longer."
133559,1,"I was given this as a shower gift for my recently adopted 2 year old girl. This booster seat is the easiest most convenient seat we have found. It is easy to install and easy to move from car to car. The safety belts are easy to adjust, alot of padding for her little behind, and my 2 year old has plenty of room to move her arms and legs. She is approx 26 pounds and there is plenty of room for her to grow and still have use for this same seat. We have another car seat (brand name to remain annonymous) in my husband's car which is a total nightmare with twisting straps, etc. Ugh!I would highly recommend this seat!!"
35212,1,"A great shortcut for the swaddle process. Of course your baby will not like it for the first 3 minutes, but after that and when combined with other soothing techniques, they will love you for it."
144815,1,"I have a Sealy mattress, which is a great mattress. It just has rounded corners & I could get my whole hand in between the crib & mattress. So, I looked for a mattress with square corners & found this one. It's a REALLY hard mattress, but she sleeps through the night & it fits snugly in the crib, so I think it was well worth it. I can't even get a finger between the crib & mattress, and yet it's still easy to get in & out for sheet changing. Anyway, great mattress!"
129611,1,"We love Manhattan Toy company toys; the winkel is our favorite and I cannot recommend it enough. It has been one of the best toys we bought for our now daughter. It was the first toy she was able to grasp, around 2 months old, and now at 6 months it is still one of her favorites. It's lightweight, the tubing is thin enough for her to easily grasp, and is great for her to gum on. It has become one of my go to gifts for expecting moms."
156136,1,"I bought this item before my daughter was born and chose it based on other reviews. For the first two monthes, it was good for a 15 min hands free break while cooking, paying bills etc. She didn't much care about the lights, sounds, or hanging animals. Now, at three monthes old, the seat is quickly becoming worth every penny. She loves practicing her new skills by hitting the hanging animals repeatedly and kicking away at the foot area to make the voice and lights happen. They both really grab her attention and she will play like that for a good 20-30 minutes at a time. The continuous music mode is also good when she is in more of a mellow mood.Overall, a good investment that I would reccommend to others."
147186,1,My Sister who is 7 months pregnant again with her second child has this bedding set for her son (11months old) with the green hamper... she loves it because its a unisex bed set (she is not going to find out the sex of the baby...which most people find out (pink or blue) we wanted something that can fit both boy or girl! over all we love this set and will use it for baby #2 crib!! over all the other crib sets some are too girly or more boy looking this is unisex!!! and its A GOOD SET!
135149,1,"It is easy to handle. We live in Florida and the heat here can be very intense, but with this wonderful jogger for two it makes it easy to take the boys for a jog or walk and they are very well protected with the wonderful canopy and easy clear window on top of canopy that we can check on them as we roll. The best part is the easy adjustment of each seat. One can sleep, while the other catches all the action. The best investment I have made for my grandchildren right now. Thank you!"
163137,1,The Domo-Kun Bank is probably one of the best items you can have of Domo. It is more durable than the dolls or figurines and can hold a good amount of pocket change. The artistic quality is also very high. It would make a great gift for the Domo fanatic or anyone into Japenese culture in general.
46609,2,"Contrary to what other reviewers have said, this product does not work well with a bed where the mattress sits in the frame. The drop down assembly needs about 3 inches of space, and the anchor needs a box spring to function properly.The product was well packaged but seems a bit flimsy once installed.And if you do have a box spring, you can get this for $20 on target or walmart's web sites."
173859,1,"Great product. We have a two-month old who usually wants to be held, sometimes for hours. Now we put her in the swing and she's happy there most of the time. She can sleep and play in it. It's a sturdy product with many great features.The only drawback is that it seems to go through batteries pretty quickly. We've had the swing for less than a month and the batteries are dying. It would have been nice to be able to plug it in to a power outlet."
57970,1,"For those of us that were physically and medically unable to breastfeed, this is a very helpful product. It's a good bottle warmer, it just takes a little longer to warm a bottle in this one then in some of different brands (the Night & Day bottle warmer by The First Years is much faster). Still works great, though.Sometimes bottle feeding isn't as easy as some people seem to think, so products like this are very helpful."
62987,1,"Leachco Snoogle Mini Compact Side Sleeper, Sage/White dotI am 5'5"", 185 lbs, and 17 weeks into my first pregnancy. My back was beginning to hurt, and I was constantly worried about sleeping on my back, so I was waking up at least eight times a night. I thought it was ridiculous to spend close to fifty dollars on a pillow. I tried merely sticking a pillow between my legs while I slept, but it just ended up on the floor. I looked at both the mini and total snoogle. Although the full size pillow looked great, we only have a queen size bed and I was concerned about my husband having room to sleep next to me.The first night I slept with the pillow was wonderful. My back felt much better, and I slept through the whole night. I generally use the larger U-shaped section between my legs and the spacing is perfect for relieving my back. I often wrap my arm and sometimes my leg around the part of the pillow that is parallel to my body. This position keeps me from turning over as I sleep. Overall, my back pain has lessened, and I sleep through most of the night except for bathroom trips.The other reviewers had some concerns.(1) Size: The pillow is not a full sized body pillow. If I had a king size bed, I would have considered getting the bigger snoogle. With the mini snoogle, you will mostly likely use part of it along your body and the U-shaped section either for your head or between your legs. This size is nice because I can still use my own tempur-pedic pillow, and I don't have to sleep husbandless.(2) Itchy cover: I do wish that the cover was softer, but it is by no means itchy. I will most likely be making a cover out of a nicer material, but I sleep fine on the given cover.(3) Tip poking: The U-shaped section is slightly uncomfortable when between my legs because the tip tends to hang out around my butt as I sleep. After about a week of using the mini snoogle, I have trained the tip to rest above my thigh and it has stopped poking me precariously. The other end did tickle my neck as I sleep. Now I tuck it underneath itself and it no longer bothers me.In conclusion: Get a pregnancy pillow. The mini snoogle helps with my back pain and keeps me from rolling over during the night. I would suggest it for purchase."
21462,2,"The print on this diaper is completly adorable! However, the diaper itself feels cheap and isn't very adjustable. It also doesn't feel much like an AIO."
32990,2,"I thought this was great - it did it's job. But I quickly stopped using it when the professional car seat inspector told me that they are not recommended. They prefer to use the pool noodles as they work better. Thus, save your money and have your local police inspect your seat. They should provide you with the pool noodles."
61095,2,"I would have never invested in this product if I would have asked around first. This product has good intentions, but doesn't deliver. The diaper genie wouldn't wrap the diapers. They would just rip the plastic and fall to the bottom. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone!!"
117060,0,Good idea but never used it. I got this for my husband but he never used it. I tried once but it didn't really hold a lot. It's okay but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
51301,1,"I bought this pillow when I was 7 months preg. I am petite (5'3"") and my belly was not cumbersome until that point. During the night I would find myself on my back and the 5 pillows in the bed were on the floor, on my husband, etc. I tried a standard body pillow but it was too clumsy for the bed. At one point my hubby decided he would just sleep in the guest room because the pillows took up too much space. I got the snoogle pillow and we are both EXTREMELY happy with it. He has always been a big spooner and the pillow is not so big that he can still wrap his arm around me and snuggle. (bonus for me :-) I like it because it does not allow me to roll onto my back and is just the right size for a petite person. The curves are just at the right spots!I used to wake up 10-12 times a night to rollover, or adjust myself but I'm down to 2 or 3 (including a bathroom break!) I was also recently put on bedrest (I'm 8.5 mo. now) and am so gald that I bought this pillow before my house arrest. I would HIGHLY recommend it.I took off half a point because as other people have mentioned it is expensive and the quality is nothing to brag about. The function and comfort of the pillow is great and if you are having a hard time sleeping, I would certainly purchase this."
19070,1,"This product is so much easier to use than the ""typical"" baby carrier. I love this product and it helps my little one to fall asleep as I walk the church halls with him. I highly recommend it."
131654,0,"But gets the job done if we remember to bring it. Truth is it's a bit big. Great for the diaper bag, but that somewhat defeats the purpose. I want to leave that thing in the car! Plus my daughter skirms and I fear it will shift and she'll fall off or in. I think it makes her nervous as it has some flex to it. Msybe she'll get more use to it. I like the idea of it, but it has not seen the results that I was hoping for yet."
79475,1,I love these diapers. They are soooo soft & keep my son dry. I have been given samples of other brands of diapers and they just felt thin & rough & did not want that on my babies skin. I just wish they were consistant with the wet indicator. Some boxes have them & some dont.Plus i love ordering these from Amazon. They are the same price as Sam's Club but i dont have to pay shipping or fight the crowds & I have always received them in 1-2 days. I wish they made these in size 3 & up.
166492,0,I was disappointed that the pamper's baby dry did not stay dry all night like the swaddlers did on my 5mo.
126988,1,Diapers are great. And cheaper here than Walmart. I will keep ordering from here. Good brand and good fit for my lil girl.
79625,0,"This fits our elongated bowl, so I don't know how well it would work on a regular bowl. It is easy for my three year old to put on and take off himself, but the plastic is flimsy. When he takes one hand off the handles to turn around and sit down, the whole thing leans to the side he is still using for support, threatening to flip off. My son has learned to adjust and not lean so hard on it. A timid child might be too frightened to use it. That is why I only gave it three stars. It is a fabulous idea, it just needs to be made more stable."
174939,1,"This is a study, perfect sized tub. Nonslip bottom, it's cute, it quacks. We have used this almost every night for over a year. My husband put a small patch into the bill and it keeps on trucking. My 17-month-old still loves it and so do I."
44642,1,I really love it.....HappyPrice is little high but totally worth it
130663,2,"I received this swing as a shower gift. I immediately had trouble with the swing right out of the box. The motor unit was very loud and the music was distorted. After contacting Fisher Price they sent me a new motor unit. This motor unit worked for a couple of months and the mobile quit working on it. I once again contacted Fisher Price who sent me a new motor unit. After a month or so the mobile quit working on this one too. Fisher Price sent me another motor unit. I was very disappointed to find that this motor unit (with fresh batteries in it) was not free of defects. The volume control does not work and the music is either distorted or does not work at all. Yes, once again I am going to have to contact Fisher Price. I am guessing that Fisher Price is sending me reconditioned motor units. The warranty on this swing expires in July and who knows what will happen then!My daughter is now 7 months and loves the swing when it is working. She has used it since birth. She loves to watch the mobile and the swinging motion is so soothing to her.This swing is a great idea, but the quality is questionable."
7704,1,"it is a great perfume, but no perfect. I am so happy with all experience, buying and the final product, I recommend 100%."
107127,2,I was at an open house this weekend looking at a home I might buy...you could smell the diaper pail through out the entire house. It was really strong when you were in the baby's room.They had this diaper disposer. I finally suggested to the listing agent that she might try putting some baking soda in it because everyone is going to think the problem was with the carpet!
10992,1,"My 3 year old is small for her age, and with a seat cushion underneath it's perfect. Without it she's still a little short for the table. I was ready to get rid of the high chair and this was exactly what we needed."
54574,0,This seems like it will be a great mobile but we had a very difficult time getting it attached to our crib. When it finally was attached we tried to adjust it and the small o ring between the two attached sections broke. It broke with very little effort. When we researched reviews on other sites we noticed the same complaint. Once that ring is broken the two pieces do not sit right together and many people complained that the mobile seperated and fell on their babies! Yikes. We're taking back the original product and hope the second won't break so easily. Serious design flaw.
59307,1,The item does what it supposed to...keeps my kids safe. It was a little hard to put together but I figured it out eventually.
156799,1,"We purchased this excersaucer for our 5 1/2 month old preemie (4 month adjusted age). It took about 30 minutes for me to put together, and was not difficult, even with my 2 year old ""helping"" as the baby lay next to me. When we put our daughter in it for the first time, she LOVED it. The next day, however, the paint on the spring covers started flaking off. This is the red paint others have mentioned. We immediately called evenflo, who sent us replacement covers. The replacement covers arrived in about 5 days. We had read about a couple of toys that would cut or choke the littler babies, so we used the seat lock to keep our baby facing away from where we placed those toys - facing her towards the soft frog toy. She loved it! She is now 7 months, and still loves it. She now plays with all the toys, and we have had no problems with the jester toy.We also LOVE the folding feature. We live in a small apt, and can fold it up for storage. We also tucked it into the trunk of our compact car this past weekend to take to grandpa's house. This saucer also seems the most sturdy choice, even with the folding feature. Learning to fold it was kind of difficult, but now that I know how, it is very easy, and I can do it by myself in less than 30 seconds..."
31878,1,"Our son does not mind sitting in this carseat. I like that it turns into a booster seat later and for now we just use it as our second carseat (although it's become our primary carseat lately). The only two negatives about it are:~The bottom of the 5 point harness system is not too comfy on his legs/between the legs.~If he ever falls asleep in it, there is not much support for the head."
30590,1,"As a rule baby tubs are rather bulky and cumbersome. In the beginning I washed him on our bed with waterproof pads underneath and all was okay. As he aged and we moved to a house with glass doors in the tub, the handling of the tub became a bit tricky. If your baby has long legs once he/she gets older and can sit up, the bigger kid side will not comfortably hold them. The best most comfortable use imo was from newborn until pre sitting up. But again that's only if your baby has long legs. Gotta love the hammock style support for newborns though. A lifesaver for new parents who aren't yet too comfortable handling the baby. Enables you to support the neck, body etc and have the safety net underneath."
114954,1,"This is easy to clean, portable, and comfortable for my children. I LOVE it, and it is replacing the big room-size high chair we were using that was a cleaning nightmare!"
38878,0,I bought this tub for my son when he was first born. It worked great for about 2 months. But then the foam on the inside started to loose its shape. It started to get flat. But we could still use it even after it flattened out some.
22335,1,"I'm an Army wife, and when my son was 15-months-old my husband deployed for a year. My son and I lived on the road, from one family's house to another.We flew with this and just checked it as-is. Despite several flights, and flight changes, there was no problem with it. Since it counts as a ""necessary"" item, it also checked for free along with a stroller and a car seat. It didn't even get a rip in the bag/sack it comes in. Perfect.My boy grew up sleeping in this, and it remained sturdy, stable, and safe until he was nearly two-years-old.The ""frills"" these things come with (diaper bag, changing table, mobile) are all cute and fine, but realize your personal, actual needs in buying these things. My boy loved the mobile, but he quickly outgrew needing the ""baby"" features of this bed. In our life it's primary function was as a portable-crib: and it was excellent for that."
87256,0,We got this as a shower gift. At first it worked really well with our son but soon we discovered that he had a minor case of Reflux. This does the job of cutting down on the air but it's hard to get all the formula into the nipple toward the end - so he did get some air. The nipple is nothing like the breast like it says that it is - it was too big for our son's mouth. It was easier to clean since all you have to do is remove the liner. But buying the liners all the time can get costly. I would seriously recommend get the Playtex Ventaire's because it cuts down on the air alot more and the bottles are angled to as much formula into the nipple as possible and the nipples are much easier for baby to suck on (make sure you get stage 1 for newborns and stage 2 for older babies).
113234,1,"I have been using the diaper bag for 1 year....the corners are starting to rip, probably can be used for a couple more months but as much as was, I am a bit disappointed. It does clean up very easily and the bottle holder is very thick and does a nice job keeping the bottle warm or cold. Love the inside 3 pockets and the end pockets, great size for cell phone or tippy cups. Holds plenty of gear for 2 kids."
130234,1,"I was hesitant of buying this swing, in part because of the cost, in part because of the amount of space it was going to take in my tiny place. My wife Sharon convinced me of buying it, and I couldn't be more happy about this. Daniel (now 5 months) loved his swing from day 1.Since we have had the swing, we've been able to sit down and have dinner without him fussing, and anytime we have problems getting him to take a nap, we just have to sit him in his swing and he goes to sleep in minutes.The swing can go back and forth, or side to side. Ours prefer side to side, althought sometimes the other motion will calm him down. The swing also includes a mobile, which works great in the first 3 months, and lights, which works great after 3-4 months.I've read complaints about being noisy, I can assure you this is not a big problem. Only downside of the swing is its size (it takes appprox. a 4' x 4' square). Battery life is pretty good, but make sure you always have four D batteries at home, once you've used the swing, you will not want to be without it for even a day.I would recommend this swing to all new parents, it's worth the investment."
104083,0,"These disks are OK, but I was really looking for something that was stick-on for the lid of my Diaper Genie. I ended up having to duct tape the disk to the lid and place one in the bottom. Works OK, but not was I was expecting."
66140,2,"I bought these bottles with the hopes that they'd reduce my baby's gas and fussiness. I thought these were the answer based on all the great reviews they got on this site. However, the stage 1 nipple was way too fast for my baby, and it caused her to spit up nearly everything I had just fed her at every single feeding! I kept thinking she just needed to get used to the nipple flow, so I stuck with it. But she just got fussier and fussier because she was spitting up everything at each feeding. I went back to the Vent Aire bottle I started out with. The stage 1 nipple on the Vent Aire is slow, but my baby keeps all her formula down now."
172709,2,waste of money the shower worked very poorly when it worked now it dosen't work at all. the baby sling was awkward for my baby to use we tried using it without the sprayer and that worked ok. blah
181115,1,"My baby has been using this play gym since he was just a few days old. He loves it! And, because as parents we love to see our son happy...we love it too! It is such a joy to watch him play in his gym, because he will move his arms and legs, smile, coo and squeal in delight at the colorful toys! He ""talks"" at the bright butterflies and will stare at the lights for a long time! He absolutely loves the monkey, too! There are so many things I love about this play gym! It is bright, colorful, soft, comfortable (our son has snoozed in this gym a few times), stimulating and keeps our son occupied for quite a while. It comes with so many toys that you can move around to switch things up or take with him for diaper change or in the car seat. The music is pretty fun and the rainforest sounds are very soothing. My son is now 2 months old and he still loves it whenever I place him in his Rainforest gym! And, I'm sure he'll continue to love it as he gets older and is able to use the ""play"" mode and discover more about this gym's features (crinkly leaf, different textures and embellishments on the mat). This is well worth every penny we spent and I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a play gym for their baby."
143652,1,I found these very helpful when my baby had not yet learned to latch on properly. It saved me hours of pain. I would have loved to know about this product before so I could have used them with baby no.1
66620,1,"I have never had a swivel wheel jogging stroller before, or a double jogging stroller for that matter. I did have an instep single jogger with my first baby 7 years ago. I finally upgraded with the birth of my 5th baby because my oldest 3 are in school and I can actually utilize a double jogger. I'm training for a half marathon and I wanted to find the best quality stroller for the best price. I feel like I found that with this stroller.Lots of reviewers complained about the recline of the seats, and they are reclined. My kids don't seem to mind. For walking, I have had the front wheel in swivel mode, I really like it. It is smooth and almost feels like I'm not pushing anything. When I'm walking actually one of my older kids likes to sit on the foot rest, so in essence, I have a triple seater.For jogging, I lock the front wheel. I recently jogged with it through my neighborhood and was a little disappointed. The front wheel rattled a lot. In all honesty, I think its because I was unable to get the wheel attached to the stroller tight enough. When I was attaching it, I got it tight but then it was too tight to lock. So I loosened it so I could lock it, but now I think its too loose. More a user problem than a stroller problem I'm sure. I'll just have to get used to reattaching the wheel.Unfortunately I have had a hard time fitting this through doorways. I'm not sure if the doorways in my house are the standard size I'd find out shopping, but I haven't dared try it yet because it doesn't fit through the doorways at our home.The bottom bag/pocket is large and as some other reviewers have said, it is low and stuff can fall out. I really appreciate all the other little nooks of storage that this stroller has; a mesh pocket on the back of each seat that zips, little pockets inside the seats for the wee ones to keep their treasures, and the parent ""tray"" is nice. It will hold two water bottles and I found that it will fit my big camera in place of one water bottle which is PERFECT! The ""tray"" also has a zippered bottom and a mesh pocket on the side, perfect for keys and cell phones.I wasn't sure what to expect with the adjustable handlebar, but it was an appealing bonus with this stroller. There is just a button on either side of the handlebar that you push in and the bar goes up to a high, middle, or low position. It is very helpful for long stretches of pushing, we can easily take turns at the helm and neither of us has to hurt our back in the process.The shade is another bonus. It is quite big, so nice for those of us in sunny Texas heat with fair skin.All in all, its not perfect, but truthfully I don't think they make a ""perfect"" stroller, especially not in this price range. I would gladly recommend this stroller to friends and family. I'm so glad I got!"
123488,1,"Since, this play yard is larger then the other Pack N Plays it provides a much better play area. My grandson loves the activites on the sides and bright colors. This play yard is worth purchasing."
146753,1,Bought this for our 3 month old boy just before Christmas cause he gets bored easy and we were looking for something to keep him occupied. This was the perfect gift! At first he was overwhelmed with it but within an hour he was checking out all the toys on it. The real surprise was how much he got into it within a few days. His feet barely touch the floor but he was jumping in it like crazy and just loving it. He's figured out how to spin himself around and loves looking at the lights and toys. Everything else we have bores him in about 15 minutes but he stays in this for over an hour sometimes! Can't say enough about how great this is for us. The seat height adjustable so we should be able to use this for quite awhile.
72792,0,We used this digital temp tester early on with my daughter. The temperature gage worked great up until the year mark. Right around then you were no longer able to see the screen.
61222,0,It worked great for the first 4 months but after I started my daughter on rice cereal and baby food FOR GET IT!!! Either my daughter has off the scale body functions or this product was only made for wet diapers. I clean it out twice a week and still it smells so bad and when I put diapers into it a lot of the time it won't twist up so I might as well use a trash can with a lid. I will still use this product for wet diapers only. So it is still useful. After all even a little help is better than none at all and I'm not so lazy that I can't carry a few diapers outside. Just wish this product lived up to it's promises. I gave 3 stars only because it's not a complete waste of money.
65045,1,"Great work of art. It blends perfectly with my living room theme of mid century pieces. It's quite big, so find a perfect corner for it. It's very well balanced and I like to watch it move slowly around all the time. Great item for the price."
102547,1,"wonderfull, iam loved this product and arrived my home quick, i am hope buy more things in future, thanks.I am will buy more"
123182,1,"As a daycare provider, I own a lot of play yards. By far Graco is the best manufacturer of quality play yards! I own the very first pack n play that Graco made...and I still use it every day. It's as good as new and I bought it over fourteen years ago!I just added this larger model to my inventory...and I am very pleased with it. It is more spacious than the standard models and easily accommodates toddlers. The toys are entertaining for the younger folks. (although since I use these beds for naps, I would prefer no toys)I know some people find the pack n plays difficult to fold and unfold, but I don't find that to be true. It just takes a bit of practise and once you get the hang of it..this bed takes seconds to put up or put away.I highly reccommend this item."
21983,1,very easy to use and store milk! So happy they make these!!! The product makes it easy to pump milk and store it right away you don't have to pour into a bag from a bottle.
176331,2,This is the biggest waste of money. I am so ticked that it costed as much as it did and doesn't even work. It's obnoxiously loud and I'll will never buy another medela product again. This product should be taken off the market immediately.I've said my piece.
74202,1,Love this stroller! I get a lot of people who stop me to find out what brand it is! I had an older Swan Sit and Stand and the thing was a beast - heavy and it didn't fold very compact. There's not a huge storage basket so if that's a concern for you this might not be your stroller. My two boys love it. My older son likes alternating between sitting on the bench and standing (there's a restraining strap across the back that he likes to lean up against) and my younger son enjoys the front seat and the food tray. There are two cup indentations in the tray - I use one to put his Cheerios in and that makes for less mess. I also like that the foot rest is adjustable so I can put it up for him to rest him feet on. The canopy is also moveable so it helps to block the sun at different angles. It steers easily and while it's not exactly compact when folded -it's better than my old sit and stand. There's no perfect stroller but this one is a keeper!
59161,0,"My mom got me this for a present because it used to be that you had to heat your bottles for formula. Now you can feed the infants room temp, warmed, or cold. I make the bottles as I feed so I feed room temp. and actually, this is what my baby likes most. Sometimes I buy the ready to feed and store the bottles in the fridge so I warm them, but honestly, it takes a lot longer to do that than to just make the bottles.I think that this warmer actually takes longer to warm the bottles than to just put the bottle under hot water. Just my opinion."
87040,1,"Must have buy for parents with car seats. When my son was first born, I didn't know anything about seat savers and I had his car seat directly on my seats. When I pulled everything out to clean in a few months, I noticed deep lines in the seats where the leather was stretched. I immediately bought this seatsaver and I am happy with my purchase. I think it might actually save my seats when/if I ever get these car seats out of my car! I have one now for my son's booster seat and my daughters car seat."
129461,2,I regret buying this toy for my baby. It frustrates her to tears so ended up tossed aside. I bought it BC it was so highly rated but was a waste of precious money.
93867,1,Supergate III is easy to install and works wonderfully. Easy to open and close with one hand. Swing installations works the best. I have it in my doorway to my kitchen and it stands up to my son's power pushes!
71928,1,"Cute pattern, teal and gray and graphic. Easy to install, goes up to 30 lbs (hooray!), and has a super cool recline-adjusting knob *thingie* that allowed me to toss the pool noodle back to the, er, pool. Soft, washable, and affordable. I mean c'mon, who really needs a $250 infant seat anyway?"
140637,1,"I have this border up in my son's room. The bottom half of the wall is dark blue (the blue in the border) the top half of the room is cream. We got creative, we painted a few light orange squares in the cream area. Then we cut out squared portions of the border and placed them on the squares, creating a frame. It looks great. I even used a fish net as his valance, and placed stuff animal crabs in it. We also cut the waves off the top and bottom of the wall border and placed them around the window, creating a wave frame. We had fun with his room and it looks great. Oh and it wasn't hard to put it up just smooth with a wet towel and an extra person is a plus. Enjoy."
80858,1,"I received this hamper today. There were no paint chips at all. It looks great in the nursery, and is larger than I expected that it would be."
90979,1,I have used Pampers baby dry for my elder daughter till she was two and a half years old and had no issues with it. the diaper holds up good even during the night. I have a second child now and i continue to use it without any problem.
178608,1,"Like the title says, I honestly cannot rate this product highly enough. I know that the BabyBjorn is more expensive than most carriers but I would gladly pay double for it. My son loves to be held and carried and will not sleep for very long if I put him down. Luckily, he has taken to the BabyBjorn so I can carry him around, he gets sleep and I get work done. Plus it distributes the weight evenly so when I use it my back doesn't hurt as much as it does when I just carry him. At first the instructions to use it seemed daunting, but it only takes a couple of times putting it on for it all to make sense. There are a few things that have been worth their weight in gold since my baby came and this is definitely one of them!"
74891,1,"Easy to put together, easy to install. Will never use the wooden/rope gates again. With the tension adjustment, this gate cannot be pushed over and the adjustment is done with a slight turn of the end piece. A great improvement. Our family now has 4."

58324,0,"I Bought this for my baby before she born and I could not wrap her very well, for the blanket size. I just liked the color, and it was cause i pick up the right color."
3206,0,"I do like this product and use them for my twin girls, however, the sides of the wrap are really low so they end up getting their arms out really easily. This pretty much defeats the purpose of the wrap if their arms are out, right? They do work for a while, but if the girls start to squirm, it doesn't do the trick. I like the idea of the wraps, but would try and find one that keeps their arms in a little better."
183406,1,"We received this swing as a gift from a good friend for our now 6 week old. She has loved this swing from the day we brought her home from the hospital, but while the swing does wonders keeping her entertained through motion, it definitely has some cons. The mobile on it is absolutely worthless. While the bears are cute, they offer absolutely no visual stimulation to our child, and barely even move with the swing. The tray on the front of the swing is a hassle, I'm constantly afraid that it's going to be closed, and press down on her foot, and it's ridiculously hard to open, popping up with such force that the whole swing shakes, waking up our child, defeating the whole purpose. I do like the music selection, though there is one song that is rather strange that starts the first strains, stops, and restarts. However, the nature selection is absolutely horrid. It doesn't in any way, shape or form resemble soothing nature sounds, instead sounding like horrid tv static. I have problems turning the swing off, having to press the button multiple times for it to finally recognize, and another drawback is that it is battery operated, and eats through them quickly. Not a great thing in the middle of the night, when the swing is the only thing keeping our baby content, and it all of the sudden dies.It cradles her and supports her head wonderfully though, and she really does love the rhythmic swinging motions, both at 6 for falling asleep, and 3 for just staring around the room."
149969,0,I unfortunately got to use this product once for about 30 min bc my daughter hated it. The only thing i would say negative about it is that it is flimsy and the top is uneven so it was too hard for my daughter to do activities. I do not reccomend this product!
38367,1,"I love this bath-time blessing. I was having a hard time finding a way to get both my infant, and my toddler safely (and happily) bathed. My son now asks me to ""put baby sister in the boat"". They entertain each other beautifully. The bather stays put very nicely. I have no worries having them in the tub together. By the way, my son is 2 1/2 and my daughter is now 6 months. I felt comfortable with this set-up about a month ago. So far, I have had no issues with mold, mildew, or odors. The hanger is very handy for drying."
29259,1,"we keep one upstairs and one downstairs. they won't slide around on the floor, and they store away pretty easily."
60423,1,"After reading reviews of other tubs, I placed the EuroBath on my babyregistry. From the very first bath, my son loved it! Even at such a youngage, he was very safe. The angles of the built in nubs held him verysecurely and at an angle so that rinsing his hair caused the water tofall behind his ears (ie. not in his eyes). He has always had enoughroom to actively splash in the water. All my husband and I say to himis &quot;splish-splash&quot; and he gets wildly excited! He is 7 months old nowand is a whopper at 30&quot; and 25 pounds! He still lays comfortably in thereclined position so I can wash his hair, but I then spin him around andhe can sit on the other side and play with all his toys. Well worth everypenny."
162302,0,"We bought this kit and found only the thermometer and nail clippers useful. I havent had an opportunity to use the medicine dropper and spoon since most of the medicines come with droppers included and it is best to use those droppers for accurate dosage. It is a disadvantage that the thermometer doesnt beep, so I have to place it in such a way that i can read it. It is best to use the aspirator you get in the hospital. That is much better.."
164296,0,"The Pampers Baby Dry work well for protection but there were a couple things that turned me off. First, they smell like baby powder. This feature was nice for newborns, but now that my daughter is 15 months old - I can do without the baby powder. Second, the material in the diaper turns into a squishy gel-like texture once fluids are absorbed. Neither of these complaints would be a deal breaker but for about the same costs, I prefer the Huggies snug and dry brand."
32537,2,"We bought this gate as it seemed designed to work with the bannister at the bottom of our stairs. Wrong. Meanwhile the photos on the box both show this gate with one or two ""optional"" extensions. This is the most expensive gate on the market to begin with and it's too small to fit anywhere without an ""optional"" extension, at another $35. It went straight back to the store."
115823,1,I like the quality and design. The only complaint i have is a canopy. I had a hard time to install it. There should be a better way to put it on or remove it.
112939,1,I love the dresser but it was very complicated to put together. It looks very classy and looks wonderful in the room. very heavy and seems that it will last for a very long time.
4062,1,"Well made bed rail looked at them all. Thought this looked the best. Also have had this brand before and it served 3 kids well as they transitioned to the big bed. Was traveling and had this shipped to destination. Amazon did an awesome job once again getting it there on time as promised. It did take about 30minutes to put together, I guess my only suggestion - preassembled in a larger box would be NICE, but then it is supposed to be PORTABLE so I guess it makes sense for it to arrive in a small box. Small print on the instructions - get your magnifying glass ready!"
105979,1,We got this on an exchange when we brought back our Diaper Genie after 2 DAYS OF USE. Diaper Genie was a great disappointment. The Diaper Champ has been a dream! The fact that we don't have to buy refills is such a savings. We haven't had any problems with smell and the ability to use it with one hand is such a bonus. This product is by far the best. Wish we started with it. I will get it for any new Moms.
97559,1,"I got this for $100 on sale through Amazon, and it was a steal at that price! Zooper includes all the extras -- rain cover, sun cover, footmuff, carseat adapter bar -- that other companies nickel and dime you to death on. It fits our red Graco Snugride perfectly (and is nearly an exact color match to boot!), and is very easy to attach securely to. It folds up fairly small -- not as small as a typical umbrella, but it fits neatly in our '99 Toyota Corolla trunk with room for lots of groceries, which is good for us.The basket is hard to get into from the back (esp. when you have the seat reclined, which you have to do for a carseat), but we use a hanging diaper bag on the back (the carseat keeps it from tipping over; we'll have to be careful of that when the baby's bigger and sitting in the seat proper). We only drink water, so the net bag holds our water bottles perfectly -- this is NOT the stroller if you want a place to put a fountain drink, that's true. There's a little pocket on the back of the canopy which is good for paper/ tickets/ smaller items.We found it wobbles on uneven pavement, but is great on smoother asphalt and indoors (we're city dwellers, so we don't go to the mall much). However, this wobbly-ness puts our baby right to sleep, so it's great when nothing else will soothe him.Good for taller parents too -- I'm 5'8"" and my hubby is 5'11"" and neither of us has to hunch to push the handles. Oh, and the hook handles are handy for putting light-weight shopping bags over in a pinch. We had no trouble steering -- my husband steers one-handed going downhill because his feet kick the back of the stroller then.Overall, a great combo stroller. Will report back once we're no longer using it with a carseat, but for now it seems as though it'll last us until he's walking everywhere on his own"
66937,1,"Was easy to install -- much better quality than the other baby gates we bought at Babies R Us. In fact I was soooo disappointed with the gates at Babies R Us, I did quite a bit of research --> found the Cardinal website to be very informative, with videos, about how their gates function. I rarely write reviews, but I think these Cardinal gates are much better than other baby gates on the market!Easy for my wife and I to quickly open and close -- with just one finger. This gate is perfect for a high traffic area.Agree with some other reviewers though, you do need longer screws if securing one end into a stud through drywall. I just used a couple drywall screws -- worked great."
90374,1,"Love the Baby Dry diapers w/o dry max! Cruisers have the new dry max which broke my son's little bottom out with sore like blisters. Glad Pamper's is still making this on w/o dry max!Best part about his diaper box was the price! With subscribe and save program and signing up for amazon mom I will get 30% off diapers and free shipping. This price simply cannot be beat, even at membership clubs!Great job amazon! Diapering baby just got cheaper!"
26307,1,I was worried when I ordered this that it would not fit my Graco Ultra Car Go Booster seat. All the reviews were about car seats and nothing was mentioned about the taller booster seats. I received it yesterday (11/30) and the booster seat fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare. I can see already how helpful this will be for me to travel with my two year old this Christmas. I even have room to carry a diaper bag and a backpack to use as carry ons.
102924,2,When we tried it out at the store the push button wasn't working to dispence the diapers. We purchased it anyway because it seemed the easiest to use (only need one hand - unlike the genie). We got it home opened the box to try it out and the button to dispense the diapers didn't work on this one either.I would NOT recommend this diaper pail because even if it does work when you get it home I can't see it lasting long. -Cheaply made-
19830,0,"I have used these bowls at my parents' house and on their high chair it is a great product. At our home, they are sadly useless. Our high chair tray as a matte finish to it and the suction does not attach. Their high chair tray has a glossy finish. Think about the surface you want to use these most often with before you purchase them."
124557,1,"my 9 month old son love these cups, the quality is very good and the colors are beautiful, he plays with these everyday."
103325,2,Poorly made and I broke 4 of them in the first year
129682,2,For my last child I had to use nipple shields for a while and they worked fine. I don't know if my experience is unique- but I just ordered these with my second child and they were far to big for her- they made her gag. Could not continue use of product.
161165,0,"I honestly have used something, anything from this kit maybe 4 times in the past year and a half. I keep it in the diaper bag and forget I even have it! The case is handy. The clippers are very nice, brush and comb normal. Other than that, are you really going to use that toothbrush? It's not really sanitary.Overall, it's a nice little handy kit if you remember you have it!"
172240,1,"I used this seat when my dd was under 15m. Now, I am using it for my son. I never really had a big issue with it, just small ones. a) It doesn't turn well in water(mainly I think cause of plastic and friction) but that didn't matter to me cause I don't really find myself NEEDING to turn itb)instructions- I don't remember if it came with instructions but when i would put it on the tub, I would lean on it to force it onto the tub. After doing it this way for dd for a year and for ds for awhile, my hubby informed me that there was a handle underneath to open it. I am the type that reads manuals from cover to cover. I don't remember that at all.c)water drainage- when I am done with it, I have to lean it foreward and let it sit for the water to drain out. Now, I have been using it since 2004 and NEVER HAD THE MOLD! It' just takes a good minute for all the water to drain. I just lean it foreward and let it sit there until the next bath or my shower then move it.All in all, good bathseat with few small hangups. I love it and am continueing to use it and have used it for about 2 years"
168396,2,"Nice size, good for the money for pampers diapers, but just did not work well with my daughter. Does not have band around the back of the diaper so with my daughter the poop goes right up the back. I just use up and up at target which do great with her and my money."
17240,2,"After having the product for only 9 months, the product spontaneously began smoking and caught on fire. Luckily, my wife was home and smelled the smoke and was able to disconnect it. This could have been a major catastrophe had it not been caught, as we have three dogs at home that would have been burned to the ground with the house. VERY SCARY product! Buyer beware.-DS"
48836,1,"The superyard-I was very impressed by how much room was available! I have a little maltese and he loves it, there is room for him to sleep, eat and play and it is so easy to clean...super! It is a tad bit difficult to open and close but besides that it is just what I need, I don't have to worry about Monty running into the neighbours yard again. Fantastic!!!"
138988,0,"First off, the positive- our daughter loves this thing- a key component of her ""settling down and falling asleep"" process. It makes a great night light and goes off by itself after awhile. She can identify one or two constellations, but don't expect much in that regard. It mainly looks like a bunch of stars on the ceiling and walls. Orange isn't very useful and quit working shortly after we started using it. She likes green the best.But it gave out after two changes of batteries. After putting in the third set, it just wouldn't turn on anymore. I guess I expect better for the price. It should last longer. I'll leave it up to readers of this review to decide whether that expectation is reasonable or not.."
3906,0,"The good side of this pouch is that it's soft and flexible so it doesn't get in the way when your folding the stroller up. The bad side is that it doesn't hold drinks to well in the little drink holders on top. Bottle drinks are OK if they're not too big. Cup drinks will actually work but can easily flip over or get smashed, making a wet mess. All in all, it was worth buying, it's very handy to have some extra space on the back of this stroller for carrying extra items."
25104,1,"We bought this gate to keep our dog out of the bedroom area of our house. We have a 4 month old though and will probably be using it for the same purpose for her. It came mostly assembled already, which was nice. My only gripe (and the reason why it lost 1 star) is the cheap plastic wrench that comes with it - it slips of the adjustment screw quite easily and is not long enough to get adequate leverage."
175789,1,"I have several bags to keep at the school my toddler attends, and this holds her stinky cloth diapers the best. I have to take home the bag every night, and if it's not a great bag, the car can reek the whole ride home. This one does not let one molecule of odor escape when cinched up tight."
179075,0,"I thought these bottles would be excellent. I can't find a nipple to suit my baby. She is ten weeks old. The stage 1 nipple is sooooooooo slow and the stage 2 nipple is really fasts, she chokes and cries. I don't know, I think I'm going back to the disposables (PlayteX). But they are a pain because you have to either buy the drop ins, which are expensive or the liners, which are a pain in the butt. Who knows. I'm not sure which direction I'm going in."
22170,1,I ordered these bags online because I could not find the medela bag with the yellow adhesive stick tape. When I received my order I was greatly disappointed to find the newer bag that does not have the yellow adhesive stick tape. Thanks anyway.
144649,1,"This is quite simply the best backpack I have ever owned, AND I get to carry my wonderful son at the same time. The balance of the pack is top notch and it is so well padded that I almost forget I have it on. My wife and I brought our 13 month old son to Hawaii and did multiple mile hikes with the Rumba.HIGHLY recommended."
160253,0,"This isn't a horrible idea, but my son actually couldn't stand to be swaddled. I couldn't even keep him in a regular blanket. He liked to sleep with his hands up by his head. Mainly I tried to use it just to keep his feet warm. The velcro just wasn't strong enough to keep him swaddled."
107636,1,"This is very portable and convenient. Initially I was apprehensive about using a breast pump, but I knew this was something I would eventually need. It was easy to use and to my surprise, there was no discomfort or pain. I feel that it's better to use a manual pump than an electric pump because of the control factor. You get to set your own pace. I also like the fact that this comes apart for travel ease."
172880,1,"I do like these. My son is still chewing too much for the green spouts--hello, toothmarks! so I got these. I actually bought them to go in my Klean Kanteen sippy top, and of course they're perfect for that. I haven't had a leak problem with these yet, and they're soft so they don't hurt DS's mouth if he whacks himself."
144016,1,"Love that we had an option to drilling in our 2 ballisters, but first the production descrpition should clearly read that the kit in only for one ballister (maybe I missed it or maybe it just needs to be called out for moms with fuzzy brains?) We were in tghe process of installing the gate and realized we needed to order a second kit pronto, so install was delayed. Second the product instructions are horrible. We saw from other reviews that the diagrams are swapped, but there neds to be much more detail about the alignment of the connectors and screws. It took multiple tries to get it alligned, but we are so happy to know that when it comes down to take the gates down that our banister is still intact!"
10867,0,"I have 2 packs in different sizes. On the package it's advertized as a burp cloth. I've used it over a pillow on my lap, but it's too stiff to use over your shoulder. It's good at trapping moisture and keeping the surface beneath from getting wet or damp. It stayed strong after several washes. I used to lay my daughter on it to protect her mattress or sheets, but I find that it doesn""t breathe well enough and when she had baby acne it made the break-outs much worse."
145520,1,"It took a few tries before my 4-month-old got the hang of this jumper, but it is now her favorite toy! She's small for her age, and doesn't quite weigh enough to touch the floor yet, but a coffee table book under her feet does the trick. I really appreciate that the bouncer adjusts as the baby grows, and we are looking forward to using this toy for a long time."
68026,2,"I purchased one of these for my MacLaren stroller so it wouldn't get dirty in the cargo hold when I gate checked it. During the flight from San Diego to Syracuse they thing was basically destroyed. A 6 inch hole had been created at the seam on the side of the bag and the fabric had started falling apart (all the threads separating). Luckily where I was going I had access to a sewing machine and I reinforced all the seams and repaired the hole (a tight fit getting the stroller back in the bag). That didn't really help though it got destroyed, same thing with the fabric fraying at the seams, on the way back and I had to throw it away. At least by buying it online I saved a few bucks. They are not made to last though so don't get too upset when it doesn't."
179916,1,"I registered for this blanket and received it as a gift for my daughter without realizing what a life saver it would be. I actually now buy it for all my pregnant friends. It is a fool proof swaddle that has no velcro, zippers, or other closures. If you secure it tightly, your little Houdini should stay put. My 2 month old daughter will only sleep for any length of time if I swaddle her, so I love this blanket. I have the SwaddleMe from Summer Infant as well, but find that the velcro is too loud and wakes my baby up when I am trying to get her back down to sleep after a night time feeding. This blanket is much better for my purposes. As she's getting bigger I am transitioning to the Woombie. Another great product!"
90781,1,Pampers baby dry is the only brand that works for my baby... them keep her dry and we have never had leaks!
147941,1,"It's been 5.5 months now and this seat has been one of the most utilized pieces of baby gear we have. My little one has just about grown out of it but I wanted to pass along the recommendation since we've loved it so much. From the beginning, when we needed to put the baby down while we eat dinner or take a shower, this chair would be the perfect distraction. The vibrating option was very soothing for him. We hardly use that anymore since now he's easily able to swing at the monkey characters and set off the music and lights on his own. In the beginning we'd set the music and lights to loop, then when he was more active we changed it to light up when he triggered it.We would bring this chair with us to friends' houses for when we needed to set him down to eat dinner since we knew he'd be entertained. It has been great for that! We opted to go with this chair over a swing due to the limited amount of space we have and I think it's worked really well for us. I would definitely recommend this item."
142488,1,"I love this car seat because it is sporty, easy to use and convenient. I can easily lift my child into the seat or he can climb on his own. The arm rests fold down or up easily and the cupholders on both sides are great. Plus, it is really comfortable with the memory foam. It would also be great for someone who needs to take it to travel because it is lightweight and comes with a nice travel bag."
29917,2,It couldn't even suck a small bug inside it! To make matters worse the handle falls off easily also...I absolutely got NO milk in the bottle! If you have money to throw away go ahead and buy this...
161587,1,"I didn't have to read the instructions... I just used common sense!1. You need to extend the tub fully before use (until it snaps..I didn't find this difficult at all!). We left it fully extended because we have plently of space. Even not fully extended it is a large tub.2. You must fill the tube where you plan on using it. (which common sense would also tell you to empty it where your using it... so obviously the best place to use the baby tub is the bathroom tub! I don't know why anyone would think they could carry it full of water across a room! Also, why would you use a baby tub in a sink? Use the sling part in the sink!3. The suctions are great! It keeps it in place as it should be. I have had no problems taking the tub out. My 9 year old tries to pull it straight out... but he's a kid. You must pull each suction up separately (the suctions have tabs on them for this very purpose).4. Most importantly, my baby is happy in this tub (he's three months old) He doesn't slide around when the sling is placed properly.My final opinion on this tub is if you don't have a lot of space, you should get a smaller tub. If you don't have common sense... get a different tub. We LOVE this tub and it was worth every penny to us. We will be using this for a couple years until he outgrows it!"
65307,1,"I purchased this console for my phil and teds e3 and it fits perfectly. I finally have a spot for everything like keys, sippy cups, bottles, digi camera that I take everywhere! My only prob is that the holes for the bottles could be a bit bigger, not all water bottles fit in there, than again I tend to carry the really big ones. I like that it is all the very durable fabric vs a hard plastic console and washes up nice, after a coffee incident, which I now know is not the best thing to take along for a bumpy stroll."
851,2,"I useally buying dipers from amazon.com. However, the dipers on this box are looks like old. Also, I can see the brown spots on the surface. I really want to return it, but I already opened and used some. Check your diper all the time!!"
20171,2,"Hi all,I wouldn't rate a product so low in the face of 139 great reviews. But this is when things go very wrong :(. I bought a 3-pack of this product and while trying to hand-wash them , cut my finger . Calling customer service was worse!!! Ask for the supervisor and she didn't even cut it for a rep!!!! She forced me to choose between coupons and a refund only after returning the bottles, not fair!!!! Somewhere on amazon, I read evenflo customer service was so nice, replacing bottles and everything...I would strongly recommend checking the bottles before washing or using them..horrible molding!!!! Avent ones are so smooth to handle...not a rough spot..What's wrong with Energizer Customer Care???!!!!"
111346,0,"My husband and I bought these today. They're wonderful for baby proofing...and adult proofing! We couldn't get them out. Hopefully, we won't need to use the outlet we've put them in already."
92239,1,"I've had trouble breastfeeding since day one. My daughter is now 4 months old and has been breastfeeding with zero formula supplements since 7 weeks. The First Years Breastflow bottle made the transition from partial formula supplementation to exclusive breastfeeding much, MUCH easier for both me and my daughter.These bottles have a brilliant design and there is no bottle like it out there on the market. Other bottles claim to be ""natural nursers"" and ""most like mother,"" but they do not hold a candle to the Breastflow!! At first I used the Playtex Drop-Ins system with my daughter, but she took a bottle so often at first that she began to refuse the breast and had a difficult time opening her mouth wide enough to latch on properly. The Breastflow corrected both problems, because A) the milk came out slowly and steadily like it does at the breast (it comes out to quickly for her in other bottles), and B) the unique nipple forced my daughter to open her mouth wide as if she were at the breast, making the transition from bottle to breast a lot easier.The only con I can think of is that the nipples are a bit hard to figure out, so if you leave your child with a caretaker who doesn't know how to fit the nipple together properly, the bottle could end up leaking milk.Other than that, these are totally worth your money. We must have 10 of them at home! They are definitely the best bottle for breastfed babies, in my opinion, and I hope they work for you, too."
500,1,"Exelente I love these diapers. They work well with my daughter. No leaks here! But I used to buy them on the Subscribe and Save program, and that's no longer available. Now the price at Amazon is just as high as anywhere else. I am upset that it's not a good deal anymore."
89124,1,they work great. no need to buy the most expensive types these work the best. they are thinner than the other pampers which make them more comfortable while still doing the job.
69896,2,"The Elastic part is tape and my husband accidetly stuck it to our daughters legs. When I changed her diapr next she screamed because the tape was on her leg not the diaper. This could happen to anyone, nd I'm sure it's not good for a new baby's skin."
93614,2,"It is supposed to reward with music but for the new at potty training every time you fidget just a little the music starts and by the time it finishes it only starts again, by the time something does happen the child is tired on the music and does not realize its a reward!! Also sudden loud sounds set it off, like the toilet seat falling. I was not impressed at all."
72550,1,"I know some people may not agree with our method, but it works like a charm. We put A&D on our son every time we change him and he has only had 1 diaper rash in 6 months! The only reason he even had one was because he had a horrible reaction to sweet potatoes. I know it may sound expensive to use A&D every time, but realistically I've only used one of the containers every four months, so its not too bad and I've found that it is cheaper to buy to two tubes and just refill my big container whenever needed. Hope this helps someone out there!"
166865,1,"This is an awesome sleep sack! No worries about loose blankets in the crib or baby being too cold. I put this on my five month old son over his footed pajamas and it works great to keep him warm and comfortable at night. It is very well made, and so soft. My son loves it!"
149087,0,"A lot of reviews said that this pillow was great and comfortable but a few mentioned the seam. I still bought it thinking that maybe it wasn't so bad. After 3 nights of trying it out, I can't get over the seam issue. I'd wake up with a sore neck and shoulder from the seam just cutting into my neck. It did help with my hips though. It was really comfortable having the front and back support but the seam...the seam just ruined it all."
57646,0,"I purchased these for my 9, 7, & 4 year old. They are really too small for my 9 & 7 yearold but it is almost too small for my 4 year old. So really more for very young children. They are very cute and besided being too small would be perfect."
56180,0,"This bag has decent construction and fits the booster seat well, but that's about it. For air travel, it's better than nothing, but also has some disadvantages. It doesn't do anything more than cover the seat--there's no foam padding or anything like that to provide extra protection for the seat against damage caused in baggage handling. (But what do you expect for around $20, I guess?) More importantly, the strap is not removable, and there's no way to secure it to the bag so that it doesn't flap around. This greatly increases the chance of the bag (and seat inside) getting lost, damaged, or delayed during airport baggage handling, as loose straps can get caught in the automatic baggage handling machinery. Be sure to identify the bag as containing a car seat when checking in at the airport, as most major airlines will have a separate handling procedure for car seats that might spare you the inconvenience of a damaged/lost bag and seat."
25790,1,"Let me start out by saying that you can never be 100% with anything, at least that's my belief. You chose what is important to you and if it has all that, winner! I love this stroller! Originally my husband drove me out of my mind because he hated the idea of all the strollers that were around. Now I bought this stroller 4 years ago! That's right! My one request was a bassinet. My husbands request, that it looked cool. After months of searching I found Rockstar baby and fell in love with the line. I used the bassinet for months (my son was born 8lbs 2 oz, 18.5 in long) and of course the car seat adapter was fabulous! We got stopped all the time so people could ask us about it. Then when it was time we used the stroller attachment. It's compact, which I love, very light and easy to use. It turns great, and because of the air filled back tires, and the smooth reclining my son has used it to sleep in many times at Disneyland and other outing. The only real downside I could ever see to it is that it has little storage capacity. However, that is not so important to me. I didn't want one of those giant strollers, I love it and am excited to use it for baby two in a few months!!"
174864,1,"My girlfriend's son is an EMT and I thought what a wonderful gift for his wife's baby shower. It was a tremendous hit. Everone loved it. It helps ""Dad"" to participate in the excitement and arrival of that special child."
79347,1,I purchased the Isabella Crib Set and I am very happy with it. The bedding is very well made. I was very surprised by the quality and details. I looked at several other bedding sets but I loved the Isabella set the most. It is a little pricer than the others but it is well worth the money.The picture that is displayed for this product does not do it justice. It makes it appear white with more of a hot pink toile and it is actually Ecru and a very soft pink toile. I think that it looks very elegant. With a cherry wood I get a Victorian feel in the nursery. Or at least that is what I am told. Everyone who has seen my daughter's nursery loves it.
60433,1,I registered for this tub on line and when I received it I was put off by it's size. I was set on returning it till I realized that it fit perfectly on the bottom shelf of the changing table. Then I gave it a shot and I LOVE IT! The bottom support that rests between my son's legs works perfectly and is very comfortable for him. The side supports hold his upper body in place. I lay a hand towel underneath him for cushion and leave a little to hang over the crotch support and fold it back over him so he doesn't go pee and spray us both. Despite how secure he is I do not take my eyes off of him even for a minute and I make sure I have everything I need in hands reach including the cordless phone before our bathtime adventure begins! WE love bath time!
168246,1,"Several months ago when I was starting to build up my diaper supply for our baby who was then on the way, I intended to buy only Pampers Swaddlers and then Cruisers when she hit that size range. Then I started reading reviews and talking to friends who had small babies. I heard and read all these awful things about the Dry Max chemical that Pampers was using in their premium diapers. I ultimately decided that we would use the Baby Dry diapers instead to avoid the chemical diaper rashes that people were reporting. When I was given the opportunity to review these swaddlers, I figured it would give me a chance to see if I could actually use them on my baby without giving her an awful diaper rash. I was surprised when they arrived and there was no mention of Dry Max on the package. Then I did a little research on the Pampers website and it appears that they are no longer using Dry Max.Our experience with the new Swaddlers has been very good. We like the way they fit on our little one. We haven't had any issues with leaks or diaper rashes and that makes us all happy. My husband and I like the yellow indicator strip that turns blue when the diaper is wet. That's not a must have feature for us but it's a nice touch.I think these diapers are certainly nicer than the Baby Dry diapers. They are a better quality and they offer a nicer fit. The lining of the Swaddler diapers is a mesh that I think is a bit odd. I'm really not sure what benefit, if any it offers, but I prefer the lining on the Baby Dry diaper over it.Overall it's a good diaper and one I will certainly be purchasing in the next size up once we work our way through our stock pile of Baby Dry diapers."
27130,2,"A day after receiving my belly band I went to my prenatal visit and was instructed by my Dr NOT to use this product. It decreases blood flow to baby, for the same reason u can't sleep on your back. His exact words were, ""these things should be banned"" ... Sorry to be Debbie downer just think all mommies should know."
98560,1,"I purchased this seat for my son who is almost one year old and was outgrowing his infant seat. I want him to stay rear facing for a while longer since that is a safer alternative and this seat allows for rear facing until 33 lbs. The fabric is very soft and the colors are great. The seat is installed in the backseat behind the passenger seat and there is still room for the passenger to sit (05 Honda CRV). My son seems very comfortable in this seat, the side impact wings are like pillows for him where he can rest his head. The wings are not in his way of looking out the window or at his friend in her car seat (Evenflo Triumph) when riding with us."
160663,1,"Never have to struggle with crib sheets again! This is the best, truely, I recommend it to all my new mom friends. This is the best sheet ever. It is so easy to strap on around the rungs of the crib and that is it, nothing else to struggle with."
34614,1,"I keep reading about the cost complaints but dang bebe's cost money and storing milk is expensive if you want conveniece. I love this storage system and have had NO problems and it is not messy nor clumsy. You just pump, close the lid and toss in the fridge or freezer and when you are ready you warm in running water and pop it into the Nurser system bottles (which are latch on friendly) and voila. We are moving. The liners are tough and there are 4 AND 8 oz liners. Sure you need a few boxes if you are a working mother and double pump, but hey that is the sacrifice for feeding your baby the best you can."
76446,1,"My baby seems to like the positioner, and we have the peace of mind that she will not roll over and get herself into an uncomfortable position. Thanks to this item, all of us can get more sleep!!"
140889,2,"I purchased this pump for its comfort claim. I was having to pump every two hours and my manual pump wasn't cutting it. The Embrace didn't cut it either. After 5 attempts to use this device, I noticed the raised silicon piping on the cup was causing my skin to blister and tear from the constant ""massaging"". I tried rotating the cup so the star shape wouldn't be in the same place every time, but it continued to cause blistering and brusing.Fortunately, I had purchased the buyer protection plan at BRU and was able to exchange it for the Medela Pump In Style. The hard plastic cups on the Medela may look less comfortable, but there is nothing added to cause irritation. I highly recommend the Medela over the Embrace, especially if you have irritated or sensitive skin."
94474,0,"I registered for the Avent line because I was going to breasfeed and bottle feed. Avent bottles were great because you could pump, store, and feed all in one. Overall I was not pleased with these bottles. Conveinient yes, but that was the best thing about them. I read the instructions, and half the time they would leak. I would retry capping it but sometimes it leaked sometimes it didn't. As for the flow, the newborn nipple was to fast for my son. Most of the time he was gagging, choking, or the formula was pouring out of the side of his mouth. He did not latch on very well to these nipples. He developed a blister on his top lip from the hard silicone. Some babies may latch on better than others. Some may suck faster than others. My son took in a lot of air which lead to a very gassy, fussy, unhappy baby. After about 3 1/2 weeks I decided to try a different bottle. The playtex drop ins. We are having a lot of success. We still use the Avent bottles to make and store formula so it wasn't a total waste. My advice would be to buy a few and try them out before you invest in the whole line."
121251,0,for tye price i was epecting a bigger bag. all the compartments are great but really not big enough for two kids other than an afternoon out.
62250,1,Veryy Fast Shipping.. Thank you. Will order from you again..Johnsons washcloths work great.. i couldnt find them in store anywhere i went.Its great to bathe baby when the umbilical cord hasnt came out. I used it for both of my newborns. I would recommend this to all mothers (mothers to be )
29758,1,THIS BAG WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GIFT AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT LIKE 3 OUTFITS FOR THE BABY AND ALL HIS AMMENITIES IN THERE AND STILL HAVE SPACE. IT IS SUCH A GREAT BAG TO HAVE. IT HAS TONS OF SPACE. YOU WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BAG. IT IS A GREAT INVESTMENT.
181698,1,I selected this item - Munchkin Deluxe Care Cart - as a baby shower gift for a relative. It appears to be roomy enough for all that is needed during the changing baby times at home. The fact that it can be moved around is an added bonus. My relative was happy to receive it.
16834,1,"Second product with the same characteristics I purchase. My toddler girl is now safe since she decided to ""steal"" our queen bed."
86670,1,"Bought this for my daughter's baby shower. Not sure how practical it will be, but should make some gorgeous pictures with the baby in it. Filled it with baby essentials. Got a lot of compliments and oohs and ahhs...Nicely made basket, has a decent pad on it and the gingham fabric is lovely. I am happy with the purchase and the price."
60674,2,"We thought this would be a great item to have. Unfortunately, we were wrong. Our biggest problem was that we couldn't get the bags installed correctly. Everytime we put in a dirty diaper, closed the lid, and turned the knob, it didn't work. It would cut through the bag instead of twisting it. My husband got so frustrated with it, he refused to use it. Plus, when you calculate how many dirty diapers a baby has in a day (especially a newborn), a 25 count refill really isn't economical for people who are on a tight budget."
155869,2,"This product was recommended to me by a co-worker and it also comes with a 'foot' but when I ordered both, I received 2 hands; but in all fairness, the seller had indicated that there is a possibility that I would not be able to get the foot and I was fine with that. My son has yet to take an interest in this product at all. We tried all types of ways to get him to use it especially now that his teeth are breaking but he tossed it on the floor several times and he started to cry each time we gave it to him. It is not ideal for younger babies as it is simply too big. I am not sure if the foot is better but the hand did not work for my son and at all. We had invested in other teething toys which seem to work so much better than this one. This is filed under ""oh well, I tried, but it did not work for us""."
15204,1,"Just bought Diaper Genie II 2 months ago and it's already clearly better than the one we were given 2 1/2 years ago when our daughter was born. She's not interested in being potty trained yet and the other one smelled so bad we had to do something. We had the Genie that twisted on the top with the lid closed (not the original that you twisted with the lid open). When the lid on that one was open, sometimes it flipped the whole thing over, it was so heavy. Version II is easy to open, easy to operate, easy to clean out, and doesn't smell anywhere near as bad as the one we had. You get a little whiff if you don't get the diaper in fast, but getting it in fast is pretty easy to do. The cutter works great on the II - I had to use scissors on the old system because the button cutter just didn't cut it (literally). I wish there was an easier way to carry the unit and that it didn't open in the middle, but I'll take that over the old unit anyday. Oh, and Borax really does help cut the smell in the container if there is some when the pooey diapers are taken out. I wish I'd discovered that 2 1/2 years ago!"
150301,1,"I had one of these several years ago, and it was indeed a lovely sage green. I ordered a new one this year, and while it's just as soft, just as durable, and just as wonderful a changing pad cover as the old one, the color is absolutely not sage. It's a bright limey color. Definitely not what's pictured, nor what i had before.It's still a great changing pad cover, but just be warned, the color is far brighter than anything you'd expect from something labeled 'sage'."
95679,1,I am actually using the hammock as a ceiling wall corner laundry basket. So far it has worked perfectly and I have no complaints. It sags low with a bunch of clothes but has had no problems holding weight or staying on the wall. The key is to place the corners teh right distance apart.
171284,1,"I have a two year old and 6 month old, and they were both bathed in this tub. My youngest still is. My sink is small and shallow and this tube still fits over it. Being able to use the vegetable sprayer makes baths quick and easy. Both of my kids loved the hammock, but since they both loved to kick and splash, they moved out of it after about a month to 6 weeks. By the time my son was big enough to sit on the straight backed infant side, he preferred the big bath tub. But now if I want I can even put this tub in the big bathtub and bathe both kids at the same time. I received this as a gift, so I'm not 100% sure on price, but I think it's one of the less expensive and it's definitely worth it."
137689,1,My grandson had one of these and loved it so I got one for our new grand daughter too. It is great fun for them to find the moon.
160237,0,"I liked it okay, and we did use it a lot, but I found the small to be way too big for a newborn. Plus, it wasn't snug enough so if baby was slightly awake, he would be out of it in 30 seconds.I like the quality of it, though. I think it just works best to use a regular blanket at first, though."
19241,1,"The Snuzzler was perfect for my newborn weighing 7 pounds. I used it in the SnugRide car seat & since they are sort of narrow, we couldn't use it for more than about 6 weeks. It would probably be useful for a longer period of time in a different car seat. My baby simply ran out of room to mover arms around as much as she liked. Luckily, I could use it on the bouncy seat. Baby is now 3 months old and it still fits great and keeps her head and body from leaning to the side."
143689,0,"There isn't much selection when it comes to choosing an extended shade for your stroller.This shade is made of what I would describe as women's swimsuit material. There is the potential for it to be too flimsy in the wind as other comments have noted, but so far I have not been in that situation. The velcro tends to snag the shade material, damaging it.Easy to put on and off, although you can't fold your stroller with it on. Can somewhat be extended to varying degrees but not as nicely as the photo shows.Overall, does the job. Nothing fancy."
53932,1,"I had this for both of my kids and thought it was a good product. My daughter especially loved the vibrations and nature sounds and slept in it well for catnaps as a newborn. My son was a very large baby, so he outgrew this product fast due to the containment where his feet were. I did like having this product in the summer/fall because I could take my July/summer baby outside with me and he was protected by the screen/netting so no bugs or even light breezes bothered him and we could both still get fresh air. It wasn't useful in that way for my daughter as she was born in February. I would recommend buying this (if you can get a deal on it) for a spring/summer baby so you can use it outdoors and take advantage of all of its features. If you have a fall/winter baby, I would invest in something more open and that does not limit the baby's length since the enclosing features are not necessary. I have had friends say that the enclosing features are nice if you have a dog/pet or even older siblings that like to look in on the baby a lot, so perhaps it would be useful for that too."
126996,1,We have stuck with Huggies since my little girl was born and i couldn't be more happy with the Huggies brand and their product of diapers. This size of huggies isn't any different and I would recommend this to any parent thinking of changing.
132658,2,"this product does not keep the odor of dirty diapers contained!!!when baby was newborn it was ok, as we all know when baby gets bigger so does diaper odor. with my first baby we had diaper genie it did keep in the odor."
60984,2,If a baby stayed in newborn diapers forever than this would be a great product. As your child grows so do the size of the diapers. I was buying more and more refills because the diaper genie filled up really quick. Save your money and throw them in your regular garbage pail.
110937,1,"I love this product!! My 15 month old is struggling with getting in molars and the side teeth. Her regular teethers don't get those hard to reach places. This product does, and it freezes perfectly. I add a little Orajel training toothbrush. Because it is a teether and tooth brush in one, I put her in bed with it. It relieves the pain while brushing and cleaning her teeth. I love it and so does she. I do freeze it with the Orajel and because it's flavored, it allows the orajel to freeze inside the teether, which provides longer lasting pain relief for her swollen sore gums.Now for the ONE THING that makes it a pain in the neck: It's small..... be aware that if it gets dropped or misplaced you could very easily spend an afternoon looking for it. This is my third one. I made the decision to buy it yet again simply because I decided that the benefits far outweigh the risk. In the morning, my daughter will throw things on the floor when she gets frustrated to be let out of her crib. Her teether was the only thing small enough that took me forever to find. I'm not even going to explain what happened to it when the dog ate it.Anyway, this is a simple thing to solve, but only while she isn't sleeping. I bought a pacifier clip and attached it to the teether so she couldn't lose it somewhere, the dog couldn't get it and it didn't get misplaced. If she sleeps with the clip, she will stay away pulling at it because she rolls over on her tummy and it pokes her hurting her."
137854,0,"I bought the twilight turtle for my son as he loves to look at lights on the ceiling. The turtle is a great concept, but the light is not really powerful to make the stars really stand out on the ceiling if you place the turtle on the floor (as the directions say to do). I put the turtle on the dresser, and that has helped the stars show up more. It is an OK product."
125798,1,"Just writing a quick review to let all interested know this is a great pump for the price! With my first son (about 7 yrs. ago) I bought the Avent manual pump, definately wouldnt recommend that. I needed a pump that worked but couldnt afford a really nice one and knew Medela had a good name. I couldnt afford the dual electric pump and ended up buying the swing pump. It worked but it took FOREVER and i could never get hardly anything, so i just pretty much gave up on pumping:( Now with my third son I decided to try pumping again and read all of the reviews for the Avent Isis iQ and eventually decided to give it a try and was very pleased. I get a fair amount more milk much quicker and you can customize the pumping cycle. You have a ton of control over how everything works and can customize it to the way your body works. It is still pumping and it still takes longer than i would like but i definitely feel that my time spent is worth it now rather than a waste. It is a very good product and i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a breat pump. Oh also, you have the option to use batteries or plug it in so that is really nice as well:):) Good luck!!!"
65358,1,"I bought this product when my daughter was beginning potty training. I feared that during the long road trip to Grandma's house that she would need to go when there wasn't anywhere to go. Thankfully, she did better than I expected. We've had to use this a few times and are really happy with it. It is small. This is definitely for little kids (toddler or small preschool). The bags are nice because it can be disposed of later if there isn't a place handy. I love how it's so compact in the car!"
116340,1,"I am so thrilled with this changing table.....it fits well in our house, it looks great and it does the job perfectly."
138973,1,The turtle is lightweight and projects three colors of stars. I only wish it had an a/c adapter so it would stay on all night. Room must be completely dark for the stars to show clearly and for best results place in the middle of a room slightly elevated above everything else. Overall a good product so far.
41325,1,"It so awesome to have these wonderful diapers delivered to my home. They never leak, keep the baby dry, and are worth paying more than you'd pay for Huggies which get all bulky and don't keep baby dry."
164617,1,It fits well and can be on baby all nights. It's a great product and i'll recommend for all parents.
103110,2,"My neice used this seat and my sis-in-law loved it, so I bought one for my daughter. She ended up with scratches on her legs that she received from this chair when trying to reach out for toys floating in the tub. I put the seat away for 2 years and tried it again on my son. After 1 use he recoved a huge scratch on his thigh!! Maybe I just received a faulty one, but I felt complelled to submit a review. I am now looking for an alternative seat for my boy (who is 8 month old)."
71785,1,"We only use this when we're out and about, but so far, it works great! We have left it in the car and use it between stores. My 2 year old sits on it like any other potty chair or toilet. The absorbent pad works great - you wouldn't even know there was liquid in the bag."
73132,1,"I LOVE the Floppy Seat. It's so easy to carry along and keeps my 20-month-old daughter comfy, clean, and safe in public high chairs, shopping carts, etc. We've been using it since she was old enough to sit up well on her own (i.e. since around 6 or 8 months). It is self-containing and you can machine wash/dry it as often as needed. When my 6-year-old son was little, I never saw one like the Floppy. I bought another type and RARELY used it because it was such a royal pain to put on a cart or high chair. The Floppy is awesome. I recommend it for all new parents, especially if you'll be dining out often or having to take your little one to the market with you."
38063,0,"This is a fine product for the price. The quilt is really cute and all accessories are holding up very well. However, the bumper doesn't tie at each corner, it does fall short at almost every side. The crib skirt is pretty flimzy and difficult to put on. But it's a pretty set and I think worth the low cost. Also, I wouldn't describe the blue as any variation of navy; it is much lighter, more like cornflower."
133671,1,I saw some earlier reviews on these that said they break. I was hesitant to buy but I couldn't find anything else I liked that was so cute. I put it up by the top of the door and have not had any problems with it at all. I can see how these could break if the legs and arms are pulled too far apart. There doesn't seem to be much flexibility to it but I do not take it on and off very often so it works well for me.
84879,1,"I ordered this item for my 6 pound Yorkie who likes to piddle when I'm not home. It is large and confortable, lots of air-flow. It was easy to assemble and looks attractive in my room. The only down-side is that I was unable to find a pad for the bottom, but I folded up a towel and that worked. Also, the ""bamboo"" is plastic, but it's not bad. I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to contain a pet but doesn't want to look at a plastic or wire kennel. It comes in a dark or light finish for any decor."
123676,1,"This is the best play pen you will find. Entertaining, sturdy, large square size, good value for the money.Would recommend to a friend."
156291,1,"We loved the sleep sack for when our little one is a baby and I love that they make one for walkers. It does run big near the torso area, but I think that it's good because not only is there room to grow, but I also don't want something super snug since you wear it over pjs. It's so comforting to know that on cold nights my little one is warm and cozy in this as opposed to having kicked off the covers. A great invention! I just placed an order for a 2nd one."
116467,0,"I have wanted one of these diaper bags since my first daughter was born, but never wanted to shell out the cash. I finally gave in when I wash shopping for the arrival on my second daughter.We have been using this bag for 2 months now, and while it is extremely cute and fashionable, there are a few things I would change.1. While the shiny plastic works well for the outside of the bag to be able to clean it easily, it does nothing for a struggling mom with her hands full. This diaper bag is always sticking to doors when I am struggling my way out of doctors offices, etc. It's just annoying.2. The bottle holder cooler only holds a bottle, not an ice pack or anything else, but I have another bottle holder cooler that holds a bottle ice pack, and paci.3. The changing pad should have velcro or snaps to keep it folded. The tie straps are such a pain when you have so many other things to accomplish on a bathroom trip with an infant and a toddler on a long shopping trip day or any other long getaway day.There are plenty of pockets on the inside, but it would be nice to have a few on the outside for convience items.If I had to buy another diaper bag, I would buy a better designed one who kept busy mommies in mind."
177087,1,"This gate was easy to install, looks clean and is very strong. Our 13 month old daughter has taught herself how to pull up on this gate and shake it like a little prisoner.. very cute and the gate does not budge...would buy it again if I had the need."
93958,1,"This product is absoultely wonderful. It fits perfectfully on my son's Evenflo carseat and always keeps him comfortable and warm. I couldn't imagine having to take him in and out of a snowsuit every time we go somewhere. It is so easy to just put him in and zip him up, and pull the hood over his head. When I get him in the car I just upzip it halfway, fold the hood back, and go. I was also very greatful for this one night when I accidently locked my six week old son and myself out of the house in the twenty degree weather. We were outside for almost twenty minutes before we were able to get inside and I was very worried that my son would get cold. When I got him inside, I unzipped the wrap and ride. He was still asleep and felt as warm as ever. The price is a bargain compared to similar products and is truly a value. I just hope that my son( who is big for his age)does not outgrow his carseat before the end of winter so we can continue to use this product!!"
97988,2,"I thought that these would be great, but could never get them to work right. Sometimes they would flow sometimes not. I would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over. To many pieces, to much trouble, I would be upset and my baby would be also! Switched to Avent and loving it!"
141411,1,Great 1st birthday present...my son loves it. It's really sturdy but on tiles the wheels do go pretty fast. Alot for baby to see and do.
78708,2,The thing about this strap is that it uses the latch system on the car seat. So you have to adjust for the suitcase. Then adjust for the car. Then adjust for the suitcase again. I am travelling alone with my son. There is no way one person can work this. So unless your going to be traveling with someone I do not recommend it at all.
141575,1,"This toy has lots going on so my 6 month old doesn't get bored. She loves taking the phone off mommy plays with her by putting the phone back on when she puts it down. There is a button for volume and also for music or learning. I am a lil confused on why they put corn on red button, apple on the orange button and pumkin on the yellow button but there are so many other things going on that it doesn't make a difference."
137154,1,"I wanted something we could use for the bassinet and the changing table later. It's perfect! Soft, and perfect for cushioning anything for the baby. Can't wait to start using it! Nice quality as well."
168262,1,"Pampers have always been a step up from the other brands for us (now on our third child). They keep the moisture away from the skin to minimize rash and don't have blowouts near as often.The added wet indicator line (changes from yellow to blue when the diaper is wet) is a nice addition that I wasn't expecting.We've bought Pampers with each of our newborn children, and I recommend them to all other parents."
152319,2,The vibration unit only works if its inches away from the main unit (not 15 feet like the box says). I tried different batteries and even returned the unit for another one. The new one did the same thing. I tried contacting the first years via phone and email. Nobody EVER answers their phones and I got no response via email. POOR product and POOR service. Too bad because I think it's a good idea.
123570,1,"I have three kids. The first two didn't need a playpen, but my 8 month old baby is the most adventurous yet. Everything goes into his mouth - dust bunnies, little scraps of paper my other two kids overlooked when they cleaned up after playing with paper, anything. I'm worried he will eventually find a little toy like a Squinkie, or something will fall off of a counter, and he will get it. He also pulls the kitchen chairs over on him, so we have them bungie corded to the table legs. Of course we will still give him supervised time to roam, but we needed him to have a safe place to go other than his excersaucer. Now that he crawls and cruises he is not content in his excersaucer for more than a couple of minutes. He would much rather play UNDER the excersaucer. We let him check out the playpen from the outside before we put him inside so he would be intrigued. So far he likes it. He is able to cruise in the playpen and gum the top rail. I purchased some new toys to put in it too so he will have something new to play with in there.Each of the sides has a toy on the mesh. I've checked out two of the sides. One crinkles when it is touched and another is a mirror. They seem to each have elements that are popular in baby toys.I also got another of the same playpen for my parents house. They have a dog that chews his toys (and the baby's) to bits. And their floor is not clean enough for a baby to crawl on.The playpen sets up and folds down just like the smaller Pack and Plays. It is essentially the same thing. It is a square as wide as the longest side of the Pack and Play."
153790,2,"having been out of the 'baby stage' for some time, a description like 'gateway to go' with no picture available leaves me completely in the dark. Have pity and if no picture is available, write a better description to go with an item"
158722,1,"With SIDS to worry about, I really do sleep more soundly at night knowing that my baby is warm but not at risk of being smothered by a loose blanket. The bottom-to-top zipper really is convenient for diaper changes, and while the sleepsack did shrink somewhat in the wash, that really hasn't affected its fit on our baby. We went from a fleece sleepsack (infant size) to a cotton one (medium) when the weather started getting warm. Our baby is big (14 lbs and 25 inches at 12 weeks), so we got a medium (one size larger than recommended) hoping it would fit all summer. We shouldn't have worried. The sizes are very generous, but even a very big sleepsack works - there's enough room to grow into without being loose enough at the arm- or neckholes to cause tangling or a smothering hazard. It's perfect for summer nights that are just cool enough that we want to be sure that the baby's feet and legs stay covered, even if her nightgown rides up. Overall, I wouldn't trade the sleepsack for a regular blanket, and I highly recommend it to all parents of infants."
171366,1,We received this tub as a shower gift and it is wonderful! The hammock feature is fantastic..it really holds our daughter in place without the fear of her slipping under the water. The safety feature plug on ours does work...it did turn white when we put hot water in to test it. In fact all of the features are great..I recommend this tub to everyone!
63128,1,This tubing was just what I needed for my Medela Pump In Style Advanced backpack. I just had to plug it in and start pumping. It had the connectors and everything. Perfect!
11360,1,We have used this monitor for almost two years without a single problem. I keep it turned down low as it will buzz if you turn it up too high. It hasn't failed us yet.
10066,1,"I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big. She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in. I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat. Hopefully she will grow into this one. She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side."
80173,1,"I really like Joan Baez' &quot;Diamonds and Rust&quot;, and I also really like the version by Judas Priest, even though it would probably make her spin in her grave if she were dead. So if you like Lennon, and if you like variations on a theme, you'll like this album.I generally don't like Lennon, and I'm not too crazy about Mary Chapin Carpenter, but the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Grow old with me&quot; is worth the price of the album. I had no idea that Lennon was capable of such grace. If you like Chapin better than Lennon, you can get the song on her &quot;Party Doll &amp; Othe Favorites&quot; album."
133261,1,"I purchased this kit to have a second kit at work so I didn't have to lug one home each night and potentially forget it. It comes with everything you need to use the Symphony pump, just plug and pump! Does the job well!"
18612,1,"After my third attempt to find the right stroller, I ordered baby plant solo sport and love love love it.. Cool, easy to use, comfortable.."
65186,1,"We love the Britax Roundabout so much we bought two of them. Grandma bought another model and now wishes she bought a Roundabout as well. We highly recommend a Britax Roundabout. It is safe, easy to use, and stylish."
92426,1,"It took me 6 months to find a plain red bumper pad for my son's crib. We are doing a pirate theme nursery and after hours of searching on google, I found plain red. The cost was good and it got here quick and in perfect condition. I even found a plain red crib sheet in the exact same color, from this same seller."
16277,1,"I've used this blanket a few times now and absolutely love it! We had a few water spills and it just slides right off! Easy to use and carry around, although heavier than I expected. We love it and would recommend it to everyone!"
66941,1,"We use two gates in our house to keep the dogs where they are allowed to be. Needless to say, it gets really old trying to get from one end of the house to the other (we call it the panama canal). For years we have put up with two plastic gates that use an odd side lever that expands the gate to press against the sides of the doorframe. It is awkward to use this, so we often end up trying to step over the gate. After falling on my face twice in one week, I said enough, there HAS to be a better option out there. After a lot of research, I came across this gate and tried one. The difference is night and day. This gate is all metal and extreamly easy to open with one hand. You just pull up on the ring and twist in the direction you want the gate t swing. You can give the gate a gentle push and it will swing closed and latch itself. I love it so much I am ordering another one right now to replace the other gate. The only cons have been mentioned in other reviews - you'll need to supply your own longer screws if mounting through drywall, and it is a bt loud when closing, although this can be lessened with some cheap stick on felt pads. Buy this gate - you will be glad you did."
78489,1,"These blankets are nice and soft. The baby I bought them for loves them. They're a great size, too."
89966,1,I have used nothing but Pampers on my boys since they were in the hospital and they are now 19 months old. They work fabulous!! We have had no problems. Highly recommend these diapers!
67754,2,I bought this based on looks recomendations and description. What I got was a glorified pack n play bassinet type thing. The only difference is the side is down on one side to allow you to roll over and pat your baby. I was expecting an extension essentially to my bed with both mine and the baby's matress at the same height this is not so. So I still have to pull her out of her bed abd put her in mine to nurse and then wake her up to put her back in. Plus I have a 4 poster bed with rails down each side at the base of my matress so the sleeper does not push up flush to the bed as it said they should warn about this.
130266,1,"Both my son and I loved this swing, however.... after much use the mobile no longer worked. Still, my son loved the fact that he could rock from side to side and back to front. The music is very calming ( it put me to sleep also most times), and the lights really caught my son's attention ( lots of options!). This swing is altogether the best gift we received for our baby and I would buy it for any expecting parent!"
10534,2,"I ordered these with the expectation that the fabric would be a quality, tight birdseye weave. They are instead a flimsy gauze with poorly finished edges. I washed them three times and they are still not soft as I would expect. Gerber should be ashamed."
91596,1,"We always liked Graco products and have had several for our twin girls, now age 5. We used Graco infant seats, stollers, and now this booster seat. This seat does all that it supposed to do. My girls love the pattern, the cup holders, slide inside which is good. The cup holders could be a little bigger but safety is most important. Amazon had the cheapest price for this, with free shipping and no tax."
133622,0,Talk about the need for frustration-free packaging! My husband and I almost got a divorce over trying to take off the plastic. You have to - get this - USE A SCREWDRIVER and UNSCREW the hinges to fully get the plastic covering off. We gave up and got in a fight. What a cruel thing to do to a buyer. I was so excited to see this cute toilet and kept saying to my daughter: Want to use your new potty? Just wait 45 minutes for mommy and daddy to lose their minds and get this plastic off. *sigh*
131657,1,"So my son was refusing to go potty outside the house because public bathrooms are gross and the seats are way too big. He loves his new seat and is excited to go potty wherever we are now. So thank you Primo! I can leave my house now. Just remember not to place the seat inside the seat like other toilet reducers. Always place it over the front lip of the toilet. I give it 4 stars because it doesn't have a splash guard and if he's not aiming right - well I won't go there, but needless to say its messy."
93358,1,These blankets are very soft and wash well. No shrinking. They are thinner than the Carters receiving blankets but they are still great. They are lighter weight so it's nice to cover baby's car seat with them when you don't want people touching him or her. They are great in the summer when you just need something light in the air conditioning.
151353,1,Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror is great. Easy installation on the back seat (head rest required). Very easy rotational and 2-dimensional adjustability. I rate this product a 5/5.
51666,1,Perego by far makes the best high chairs. This is my second one my son used his until he was three. The material is lovely and cleans very easily. The positions are what makes the high chair so great. My daughter loves to play in it after she eats and has even fallen asleep in it which makes the reclining position so great. This high chair is more than worth the money.
157390,1,"I was unsure when purchasing this dresser/changer if it would be tall enough for me and my husband based on the measurements, but it turned out to be perfect! The cubbies are nice for holding baskets for readily used items and the drawers are a nice size. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that some of the ways the drawers/tracks are constructed were very difficult to assemble. It took me about 3 hours to fully assemble start to finish and I am very mechanically inclined. Once put together, though, it's very sturdy. The finish seems easy to clean which is a bonus."
114496,1,"I really enjoy this product. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the insert & cover fall off fairly easy, so for traveling it is best to leave the tray off. I was interested in the actual tray being covered for sanitary reasons, but overall it is exactly as I had expected!!"
52583,0,"I have the Fisher Price Deluxe Take-Along Swing, which, from the looks of it, is nearly identical in construction to this swing. I'd heard that the weight limit was previously listed for the Deluxe Take-Along Swing as 17 pounds, but Fisher-Price's customer service rep assured me over the phone that the weight limit had been revised and that for all their swings, it's 25 pounds. My daughter is 15 pounds 12 ounces today, and we're on number 8 (speed), the last one, so I don't see how it will continue to function well adding another 9 pounds to it.Other than the weight issue, I've been very happy with this swing and so has my daughter - it's been perfect, worked beautifully, not loud, not dangerous, good size for a small condo or apartment, foldable/portable, soothed the baby perfectly, and the seat is washable (hallelujah). If I'd known the weight limit wasn't accurate, I might have considered a full-size swing, but it has served its purpose.Another caution - I would imagine this swing might not be the best idea for babies about 5-6 months old and older, just from watching my daughter in it, who is 6 months old now. She's OK if she's tired or if she's watching Baby Einstein, but if she's restless, she is now able to reach back and grip the rear bars. She's able to stop the swing, which sort of defeats the purpose, and who knows, she could try to climb out as well. So I don't see myself using this much for very longer just because she's probably too old for it, but I know other people have babies that are younger but weigh the same as her, so I thought my review would be helpful..."
115384,0,"My son is almost 2.5 years old, and has been potty training for about a month. We have two potty seats---one for upstairs, one for downstairs. This one is decent--we have no problems with it fitting on our elongated toilet.However, be prepared to clean up pee if you use this with a boy! He has to sit just right in order to aim down and not get pee on the seat--I don't think the pee guard is high enough for use with boys. Also--if he 'aims' just right, pee gets under the seat, causing a mess on the regular toilet seat. I have to clean both seats every time I take this one off for adult use. It's easier for him to use it when he isn't wearing anything below the waist--he's better able to get his legs spread further apart for better support and aim.I think this would be better for girls--but someone has to get it right for boys!"
155322,1,"Wonderful invention, but the zip ties are more dangerous than the balcony. We left them long because cutting one of them has already broken skin. May be helpful to make the ties face the outside of the balcony."
8499,0,"I bought this to cover a tile edge in my step-down living room and to line my daughters window sills since they are only 6 inches from the ground. The padding is great and really protects her from bumping the edges, but she can pull it off very easily. Now she just tries to pull it off and chew on it, so we are costantly re-applying it. But it has helped prevent many bumps and bruises along the way."
45060,1,"Is a great product, perfect for 3 month old babies. The only thing is that smells kind of bad.. but once you wash it 2 or 3 times the smell goes away."
65983,1,"These bottles are as great as everyone says. A friend recommended we try them. Our daughter was small when she was born and was very collicy. She had reflux and in general was just hurting from gas, etc. every time she ate. We were using the small Avent bottles at the time - and not to knock them b/c if we did not have our specific problems they would have been fine - however switching to the Dr. Browns made an almost immediate difference. As she has grown we have continued to use them and have now moved to the larger sizes, again after first trying the Avent bottles that I already had. She just can't take the extra gas going in her belly yet. (the pediatrician says once she's rolling over on her own she'll be better with the gas). The biggest downside is cleaning all of the extra, but necessary parts. I now just rinse the parts under hot water after each feeding and put them in a dishwasher basket and that has been working great. As others have mentioned, I have had a few problems with the leaking... however I was not using the little travel caps they provided and once I started to do that, I have not had any more problems. I am sure these are not necessary for everyone's child, but they definitely worked for us and our situation."
93929,0,The service was excellent. I can't really tell you a lot right now. I purchased this for my 19 month old grandson for Christmas. It is wrapped and under the tree. I'll try to give more updates after Christmas.
120426,2,I think this monitor has the right idea but unless your child sleeps in the middle of the crib directly on top of the monitor pad you will get false alarms. My twin boys are 7 months old and the only reason they ever wake up in the middle of the night is because the alarm on the monitor is going off. I had to set the sensitivity on the monitor all the way up and just like before we still get woken up in the middle of the night because one of my sons had moved to the foot of the crib.
174945,1,"When we headed out of town for a weeklong trip with family, I ordered this tub to meet us there.Our little guy was just 6mos at the time and still needed a tub.This duck was super convenient while there and when we headed home, we let out the air and took it with us.Once at home, we continued using this as his bathtub (in the regular tub) until about 2 weeks ago just after he turned one.It's a bit of a snug fit for up to 2years old, but I could see how it might work. Especially considering the baby stays nicely surrounded by water with MUCH LESS water than filling the tub.After every use, we hung it up to dry and only ever had to top off the air once.EXCELLENT value and usability factor!"
82382,0,"I was excited about receiving this carrier as a gift because I envisioned carrying my baby around everywhere--while I did household chores, ran errands, and going for walks with my husband. Very quickly I realized that it was a major ordeal to just get the dang thing on! The only really accurate way to make the adjustments on all the different straps and hooks is with the baby IN the carrier, and we all know what happens when you mess with a 5 mo. old too much. Another problem is that when you face them out, the back support is supposed to fold down, but ours keeps popping up right in our daughter's face. She just chews on it mostly, but I'd rather it didn't do this.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;One good thing is that my daughter LOVES being in it (once we get going). When she was facing me, she usually fell asleep, but as she has gotten older, she loves to face out and see the world. I would recommend finding someone who has one and trying it out before you buy it."
91380,2,"I have twin babies, and need all the help I can get from gadgets because it is more than twice the work sometimes. But the complaints I have on this monitor would apply to anyone with a baby--singleton or more!I am not a fan of these monitors, and bought a much cheaper replacement monitor after reading that it did not have static (and it doesn't). The Safety First monitor Crystal Clear Nursery Monitor is so much better; buy it instead.The lights were sort of cool-- it was neat to be able to look over and see the different intensities of sounds in the dark. But the static grew worse after a few weeks; I don't know why. At first, it only got really static-y when the battery was low, but then it would have intense bursts (where all the lights lit up on the monitor) and I couldn't even hear the music of their mobile, let alone any of their softer noises (like spitting up). I couldn't re-position the monitor to make the static better, and it would get better while I was holding it only. (Like I want to hold a monitor all night long).Also-- the other monitor I have now has a Low Battery indicator. This one does not-- and once, the battery ran out in the middle of the night while I was sleeping with no warning. (I had lost the AC adaptor and couldn't find a place to purchase a new one, nor could I figure out how to contact Fisher Price to order another). I have lots of other great Fisher Price products that are lifesavers; this one is not one of them.It could be that location has something to do with this, but how will you know your home is one of the spots where there is some kind of interference that causes the static? Buy the other monitor that works fine anywhere, and use the money you save on something else for baby. :)"

101008,1,"I was trying to save money on diapers by buying the cosco brand, till my daughter woke up screaming (she sleeps through the night). The diaper did not hold well as it should, and she had pee through her pjs, sleeping sack and bedding...Took long enough to set her back to sleep after having to change her crib, clothes etc..Never again would I try to ""save"" on diapers. I prefer to save on clothes and such.Thank you pampers!"
122039,2,"We were very disappointed with this toy that we bought as a gift for a friend's baby. The daughter absolutely loves it, but the suction does not work at all. It is really too bad, because it would be perfect for a high chair toy."
69658,1,"Product is just as described, I had a hard time finding a 30"" pad to fit our table but it works great!"
1282,0,"We have tried different diapers, we really liked the built of Pamper, the quality of the materials is best (light weight and very soft) however it leaks badly so we had to change whole cloths of our baby time by time which is frustrating!! We pay more for Pamper diapers to get some good things however for some reason it doesn't worked for us.. Still we are using Pamper as it's very good materials. :("
30176,2,"I bought this for my daughter because she LOVES Dora, but our tub unit is slightly textured and none of the suction cups will stick! It floats up when you fill the tub which defeats the purpose of a non-slip mat!"

142382,2,"I do not love these as some reviewers have. These are are the third type of bedrails (fourth child) my family has used. I would have paid extra to have them come put together. There is no reason for this to come in so many pieces. The directions have mistakes in them. Now that they are on the bed, I am worried about all the metal that is in between the mattress and box springs. I can't get them adjusted to where there is not metal sticking out when the rails are folded down. That worries me for times when my daughter or other children will be playing in her room. I will give it a week or so but I have feeling these will be going when I can find something else."
12018,0,"I only rated this product with three stars because I found the double unit useless. My daughter was tiny when she was born and it was impossible to fit her head in the smaller rest. We used the bigger rest immediately which at first was still too big for her. I found that it also tangled the straps on her carrier/car seat quite often. Once she was slightly older and her head grew enough, it served it's purpose, but it's not something I would buy again."
130408,0,"I purchased a Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing a few weeks ago. After about one week of light use with my 10 lb. newborn I noticed a problem. I noticed something on the seat which looked like metal nut with a broken piece of bolt. In further inspection of the Swing I noticed that this piece had come from the arm which holds the seat between the upper and lower seat tube. This is very concerning not only could the seat have of fallen off during swinging, the piece of metal could of been a choking hazard. My baby really loves the swing, I just wanted a replacement M5 x 30 mm Screw and M5 Lock Nut to repair the swing. I E-mailed Fisher Price with this issues with hope of a replacement Screw and Lock Nut, but never received a reply.The Swing is very nice, but the design and materials used seems substandard. The idea of one inferior screw holding up your baby just seems kind of unnerving."
153048,1,"My son was over 27"" at four months, so we had to buy a new carseat because his infant seat was only safe until 26"". After having one car seat that only lasted a few months, I was happy to see that the Britax goes up to 65 lbs. At first I was hesitant about buying such an expensive carseat, but it was absolutely worth it! I was so satisfied with the seat that I bought the same one for my husband's car.Foremost, the side impact protection separates this seats even from the other Britax models. This carseat is built like a tank, well-padded, and stays put once installed. I've read reviews stating that the fabric isn't soft enough. The Regal is softer than the Brownstone, but I didn't find either scratchy and my baby likes both.Installation was easy both with LATCH and with the lapbelt. It is true that this carseat is large. I have a Subaru Outback Stationwagon and I would have had to move the front seat all the way forward to accomidate the carseat rear-facing. It fit easily, however, in the middle (which is the safest place, anyway.) It would also easily fit behind a passenger seat when it's forward facing. My car has LATCH and it was much easier to use the Britax LATCH attachment than it was the Graco. The Britax can be removed from the LATCH with the touch of a button and attached by pushing the handle against the LATCH - no hooks to deal with. My husband's car doesn't have LATCH and he also found it easy to install using the seat belt. The harnass straps adjust in the same manner as the Graco, but the rubber frame on the straps really does prevent them from twisting. The adjustable head rest moves with a knob as your child gets taller, so you never have to rethread the straps.Some reviews point out that it's difficult for a child to see around the wings. My son doesn't seem to mind this and it's certainly worth the side impact protection.My only complaint about the seat is that my son has to sit with his legs quite far apart. The harnass clip cannot be raised and is too low to allow the straps to go above his thighs. He doesn't seem to mind this, but it looked uncomfortable to me.In summary, this seat is absolutely worth the money! It's easy to install, provides more side impact protection than other seats, and will last your child until he's 65 lbs!"
48633,0,"love these blankets, but have noticed that the fabric is a bit heavy.it's flannel, which is hot."
130187,1,"This swing is a MUST have for new moms. I had my first child in January after about 4 weeks we started to put her in the swing and she loved it. She is now 16 weeks and loves to sleep in it. She takes a 3 hour nap in this swing daily. She loves to look at the canvas on the side with the bright colored fish as well as the mobile and light. You can also put your own hanging toys on the mobile and remove the fish that is what we did with one of the fish.The only bad thing about this swing is the space it takes up, but the quiet time we get from it is worth it.Buy this one, you wont regret it!"
124415,0,"Installed ok, but fit is not tight enough. The toilet lid can still be lifted 1-2 inches before it hits the arm of the clamp, which is enough for my 1 year old to cram baby blocks and other small items though. At least he cannot fully lift the lid, so it does keep him from falling in."
108462,2,i bought this potty seat for my son and the lip part to keep the pee from shooting me keeps falling off. the sticky grips dont stick to well. i would ask for my money back but it was cheap.
35865,2,"This Nuby sippy cup is described as having both a single valve and the dual valve, these are two different Nuby products. The cup pictured actually has the single valve which is the silicone spout. This soft spout is great for the younger baby just leaning how to sip, but you'll need to move on to a hard spout.Why?It will leak. And your child will figure out how to make the liquid flow freely by turning it upside down and pressing on any flat surface."
178253,1,"These breastmilk bags are much thicker than others I have used, and I frequently put more than 6 oz in each bag. Occassional leaks when thawing from freezer, but overall good quality product."
88158,1,"We were hesitant to spend $50 on an infant toy, but it was so worth it. My daughter stared, kicked, and rolled for many hours on this toy the first 6 months. The colors are great and she loved the accessories. She is now 9 months and I removed the toys. She now has them hanging on her car seat, stroller, and high chair. This is so versatile and well worth the money."
147989,1,"Have been using this bouncer for 3 months and overall it is great, our daughter likes it and the waterfall feature is very pretty to look at, plus it has the choice of either lullaby music or nature sounds. Seems very comfortable for her and built sturdy. Only problem we have found is that occasionally the removable toy bar stops working because it doesn't lock in tight enough, and then you have to remove it and push it back in very tightly. Overall pretty pleased."
173369,0,"Our daughter is 14 weeks old. She was in the NICU for 2 weeks so we didn't even start using it until then. The motor has already burnt out once about 2 months ago. Fisher Price did send a new motor component/mobile out to us free of charge, However it has burnt out again and will be calling them today. Also the replacement one they sent never worked quite right----the music would play and then have long intervals of ""hissing"" static-like noises, that would wake the baby up if she were sleeping. Also, I do worry about the pillow---my daughter tends to roll to her side because of acid reflux, and she can tuck her head under the pillow when she does this. Make sure you use the buckle to fasten them in because it is easy for a baby to fall out otherwise. When she was smaller and lighter weight, I did think that it was too fast no matter what setting it was on, but now that she is heavier---12 pounds---it's not a problem. Batteries do not last long at all in this product. All of this being said, she loves this swing and will nap in it for long stretches, but I always supervise her. When our 2 year old son was a baby we had the ocean wonders swing and also had the motor burn out 2x, so it must be an issue with FP motors. I will say they do have great customer service, but I wish they'd just fix the product!"
158326,1,"My son drinks a lot of water and so wets through his diaper at night. He is 26 months but fits in the weight frame for size 3T. We bought these and although I think they prevent some leakage, we still have a few wet sheets per week. Still an improvement. The elastic leaves marks on his thighs so I don't think a 2T would be appropriate for him. I will continue using these. I rinse them in the sink and have not attempted to wash in the washing machine."
25856,2,"The sound portion of this product failed within 30 days and it was replaced in a timely manner. The replacement also failed within two months....My baby really liked this product, I wish this review could be better."
15253,0,"Purchased these clippers to cut my baby's nails. They work fine, but are basically just smaller versions of adult clippers, and don't have any safety features to keep you from cutting baby's skin. Nothing special, but they do the job if you're careful."
9713,1,"I love this potty chair. My daughter uses it all the time. It is very easy to clean, having no little crevices to collect grime. The little splash guard is probably supposed to be for little boys, but it's good for her too - when the flow hits the hard plastic it doesn't splash out on the floor."
12553,2,"This stroller DOES NOT work with the Chicco Keyfit or Keyfit 30, even though it expressly states so in the advertising. Even when using the belts as some reviewers and YouTube'ers have said, it is terribly un-safe."

110527,1,"These are great! If you study and follow the instructions, they are no hard to install. A template is included. It does take some time, but well worth it. You can measure your cabinet/drawer facing to see if they work BEFORE you drill if fit will be an issue."
141208,2,"My 10 month old son loves this toy, but the reason I only gave it one star is this: The portion of the toy that comes off--the part with all the activities and music does not stay securely on the walker. I can't tell you how many times he has tried to pull himself up and fallen backwards because the stupid panel pops off. I can't have the panel on the walker anymore because of this. One other gripe that probably would not bother most people, but...the woman's accent--she says, ""Thanks for callin'."" when the phone is hung up or ""Ring a ling the animals sing"" is obnoxious. It is a thick Long Island accent. I'm sorry to all the Northeastern folks reading this review, but to a Southern Girl the accent is not very melodic and to be honest grates on my last nerve. Sorry!!"
12648,2,"Our 22 mo. old threw his blanket over the gate and tried to retrieve the blanket and got his hand stuck in between the squares, and I mean PAINFULLY stuck. Thank God I was able to gently get his hand back out. I later had my husband hold 2 fingers in the square (3/4 the size of the regular squares) where our son had his hand and I then attempted to unlock the gate and just the motion of unlocking the gate COULD HAVE created the space smaller, pinching into our son's wrist even more. THERE ARE NO WARNINGS ON THIS GATE ABOUT SMALL CHILDREN GETTING THEIR HANDS OR FEET STUCK. It is common sense though and one would think that a child would be able to bring their hand back out. But because he got it between the end where the gates overlap, the area was smaller. I see the far edges are smaller too. I wouldn't even trust this gate for an animal. I will be calling the company the next business day."
37185,1,"great bag for all dad's with newborn babies. great styling, you can't even tell that it's full of diapers and milk. The only problem we had was that the baby wipe dispenser pocket didn't actually work with any of the wipe brand's containers that we used. Oh, and the fact that it made my petite (5'-0""tall) wife look even smaller than she already is when she had to carry it. Well worth it though. We've had ours for almost 5-years now and will soon be using it for our next child."
136679,1,"We received this as a gift and are very pleased with it. Like another reviewer commented, this should have a remote control. My 2 month old daughter really likes the music and watching the scenes as they pass by. The only complaint we have is that it doesn't play that long and we end up having to go back and turn it on again."
84961,2,"I bought the bottles (made in USA), and loved them. But when I saw those cups are made in China, I thought they were far too pricey, so I did not buy them."
27155,1,"This cup holder holds your drink very securely however, we use it on the bee and it seems to get in the way a lot. I guess I'm trying to get through narrow spaces a lot. The cup holder has caught on something countless times. I wish there was a way to put it on top of the handle bar (not on the side). And it's pretty pricey for a cup holder!Update: I just read other reviews and one mentioned that you can mount the cup holder on the inside. Duh!"
72555,1,"The item is very good, just that the presentation si different from the showing pic, and the texture is diferent that the tube."
35512,1,"The Floppy Seat will quickly become one of your most commonly used baby accessories. It is wonderful because it fits over any and all high chairs, boosters, and shopping cart seats, protecting kids from germs and dirty surfaces, but also giving them a little extra padding, some warmth (think of those cold shopping carts), and a comfortable place to sit. The Floppy Seat wears and washes extremely well...it will outlast your little one. The feature of folding into itself to make its own bag is wonderful. Many moms I've spoken to said they intially opted against getting a Floppy Seat because of the price, but then decided to give it a try and couldn't be happier. Personally, for me it's been $40 well spent. We use ours practically daily."
140630,0,"This border is really cute, but difficult to put up. We tried using wallpaper glue like others have suggested, but it curled up on the edges and looked really tacky. We started over and used a staple gun and it looked fine.If you are looking at the Sea Life nighlight, skip it. It is too large and heavy for the socket and leans over. It almost won't stay in the socket."
38246,2,"The item is as advertised and is really cool looking, the issue is that when you wind it up it only operates for about 3 minutes, not even close to enough time to put my boy to sleep. I am going to try to find a cheap mobile and harvest the rotator part and replace the one that came with the mobile."
182225,1,"We are using the boy version of the potty and this is the second potty we have. We started potty training when my song was 6 month old and the potty we got was the same model I used for my older son. The only thing I didn't realize that my older child had his potty training started at over 24 month, and this one was only 6 month of age. The first potty we got was the model that turned into the step stool and had a removable guard. And as you can guess, that removable guard was used for many different things, but not the one it was intended for :) We tried to chew on it, we tried to fling it across the room, feed it to the dog, smack the dog with it, but NOT to keep it in the potty for proper use. Needless to say, after a bit of frustration, we ordered the ""Once Upon a Potty"" gift box and mini book. The potty worked out great for using it as intended, but I have found it very challenging to clean.The problem I encountered is that we have a standard sink in the bathroom and the potty doesn't quite fit in the sink under the spout - I have to kind of wedge it between the sink's sides and the spout in a tilted position to get any water in it. The next challenge is to pour it out in the toilet - which I figured out that works best if the contents is poured through the front where the guard is. It has to be emptied with a very swift motion, or otherwise some of the content ends up running along the potty's sides and ends up on your feet, floor and whatever else is on the floor around your toilet. Along the way the side that everything is poured out through ends up dirty and the entire potty has to be washed with soap. I wish that this model combined the shape they used with the removable little pot inside for easier cleaning. As it is, I ended up using the bathtub showerhead with removable hose to fill the potty with water before emptying the content.But over all, the emptying problems are mine, not my son's. He tremendously enjoys sitting on it and reading the little book that came with it and that is why I gave it 4 stars (my difficulties still can't overshadow his overall excellent experience). Our favorite page is where Josh wears his potty on his head because he hasn't yet figured out what this potty-thingy was for.I would recommend this model for young children whom you can't yet train not to mess with the guard. But be prepared to have a few mess ups the first few times you empty the content into the toilet - I suggest to move away the bathroom rugs from the toilet the first few times until you get in a hang of pouring the potty out swiftly, so that if you do have a spill, it's easier to clean up."
114660,1,My son really needed to be transitioned to a seat were he can sit properly at a table ( with out kneeling in the chair) This seat is great. I am sure I will use the tray when we travel but we are trying to get away from the tray thing all together. My son is 19 mo old and he did great in the fp space saver high chair till this point. I am not sure why people are commenting on this booster not tilting properly -- I didn't think it was designed for an infant to start feeding. We should have got it a few months ago when he started climbing on his own into the highchair. Straps securely to out wooden kitchen chairs. easy to wipe down or vacuum out. :)
132605,1,"I was looking for a pale that would keep the smell of our biodegradable gDiapers at bay and when I saw the biodegradable refills for this, I decided to try it. It definitely helps with the smell. Before, I was emptying a lidded garbage can each day and now I only have to do it about once a week. I keep a box of baking soda in the bottom to absorb some of the odor as well. It really seems to help.The major selling points for me were:1. Biodegradable refills2. Double barrier lid (flip-up lid and then another trap door type lid)3. Lockable lid (there is a knob that turns to lock the trap door so toddlers can't throw in random items you have to fish out...yuck!)4. Smooth open and close via foot pedalI'm very happy with this purchase. It's easy to use, keeps the odor down and will actually save me money in the long run, since I don't have to buy a ton of biodegradable garbage bags that need replacing each day."
110733,0,"I am still waiting for my baby to arrive but I have pretty good idea about this. We got both mini and the original, and we thought we would keep the original. Ended up returning because it's bulky. We fly abroad a lot, and this one will not fit in any baggage.The baby likes it or not, that's another story. I am disappointed by this product as we had to return two items because they were defective. To unlock a stuck button both my husband and I, we spent more than an hour and ended up with numb hands. We expect more considering what it's worth. Folding and unfolding was way easier than what we expected tough.I don't know why people suffered that much.We are into safe co-sleeping, so ended up keeping the mini, thank god it was not defective. But be aware, convertible mini won't really serve as a playpen in the future, it's tiny. You can benefit maybe for a year or so. You can still use the bottom of the convertible mini as a storage, and put items you won't need immediately as it doesn't come with a zipper on the side.UPDATE AFTER A YEAR: We received a non defective one in the end, and we used it for approximately 4 months. Our son is huge, he outgrew it. Even at 4 months, he could barely fit. It's compact, we could carry it in a luggage to Europe. The concept is nice, the baby is within the arm's reach. However, it's not easy to go in and out of the bed. You can simply put a pack and play very close to the bed, it will be the same without the hassle. And accessories will be a lot cheaper. Although I had a good experience with this sleeper, I wouldn't buy it today."
128463,1,"These bottles are a great size, conveniently fit in my diaper bag and pretty much 2-4oz is what my baby has had up to at least 6 months. I felt much more comfortable heating my milk in these bottles than in plastic, mind you I never microwave because it destroys nutrients. I used the First Years bottle warmer and they fit in it perfectly. I also used Medela's nipples instead of the Evenflo ones because I felt they had a better flow. Make sure though to get the nipple rings from Medela too because the Evenflo rings do not fit the Medela nipples. But the Medela nipples with the Medela nipple rings do fit on the Evenflo bottles perfectly. Also you can attach the bottles directly onto your Medela pump, which is amazingly useful. I would fill my Evenflo bottles directly as I pumped and capped it with Medela caps or Evenflo caps. I have frozen the bottles and warmed them uncountable times and nothing ever happened to them, they are great for freezing (as long as there is some room left for expansion, don't fill beyond the 4oz limit). Finally, the question of breaking, my baby has dropped it from the highchair a few times it never broke, they are so strong and sturdy and thick. Best of all they are CHEAP!!! Shop around for the best price. Finally, baby can hold them too, she holds it fine at 5-6 months, which is when they can learn how to do it anyway, and so no it is not too heavy. Babies are stronger than you think, try letting them grab onto your hair or jewelry, watch what happens!So in summary:- fits Medela nipples, Medela nipple rings, and Medela breast pump parts- can be frozen with milk- can be heated in First Years bottle warmer- does not break from high chair height (on wooden floors)- no plastic leeching into baby food!- baby can hold it and lift it (4oz bottles)- inexpensive and recyclableWe had tried Medela plastic bottles and they discolored, not only that, my MIL left soapy water in them once and they absorbed the smell of the soap, and no matter how many times I washed it, or put it in the dishwasher the smell didn't go away. Obviously if something can absorb chemicals it can leech them too. Stay away from plastic, esp. when there is an amazing alternative."
105131,0,"I have the diaper champ and for ease of use it gets a 5, you dont need special bags and they are easy to change. However, WOW does it stink. We have tried Lysol, diaper pail deodorizers and it still smells bad. Most of the time it is bearalbe, diapers stink you cant get around that but it really stinks when it comes time to change the bag. I am keeping it around but for my next kid I am definatly getting a diaper genie 2."
77005,1,Gender neutral swing. My son loves being in this swing and I love the fact that is can be battery powered or plugged into an outlet. It isn't very portable so if you are looking for a swing to be able to move around alot this is not the swing for you. I also like the fact that the toy bar is removable. It has a removable infant head support also which is a nice feature.
49389,1,"We bought this play yard--and the two-panel extension kit--in 2010. We are still using it in 2012! Mind you, we only used it once as a ""play yard"" for our twin toddlers. It isn't big enough for them outside, and as soon as the novelty wore off all I got was whining. Moreover, had we tried it again I'm sure they would have figured out in minutes how to just pick the thing up and crawl under.What we used it for is babyproofing, in about a thousand different configurations. We originally divided our open kitchen/dining room in half, which allowed us to totally block off the front half of the house from the kids. Then, when we opened up this part of the house, we used it to block off certain areas (kitty litter/cat food area, trash can/broom area, treadmill area). We also took four of the panels with us on vacation--used two to block the TV and the other two to seal off the deck steps. We've taken a panel to my mother-in-law's house to tie it to her stair banisters. And we've used two panels to seal off the steps for our own deck, making an outdoor playpen out of the deck all of last summer.I highly recommend buying several sets of theKwiktwist Giant Twist Tie 2-Pack- Redso you can attach these to table legs, banisters, or any other furniture. (We've even put a few screws in the walls and tied them in place. You can also of course use any other type of tie-line or fabric to tie these in place.)I can't imagine anyone--except maybe a family with a completely uninquisitive, mellow, obedient child (does such a thing exist?)--being sorry they made this purchase."
174870,1,I was VERY pleased with the quality of this mattress pad. I washed it upon receiving. It held up great in the wash & was very soft. Fits the mattress perfectly without any bunching or loose folds. Highly recommend!
83552,2,"This is the biggest piece of [junk] I have ever bought. U must know that once u assemble the piece of doodoo u can't disasemble it. So what if you want to return it u just can't. Plus its not secure at all since my 21 pound daughter moved it. (...). Yes the side comes down but its a [hard] to work it. I just have one thing to say to Safety 1st, you people don't know the first thing about safety. Dont buy it please dont buy it."
110714,1,"We used the co-sleeper with my son for several months and it worked well for us. As he got a little bigger and I was worried he was too mobile, we moved him into the bed with us. Then it was nice to have in place because I didn't have to worry about him rolling out of the bed.I am now expecting a little girl in about 2 weeks. We've already gotten the co-sleeper prepared for the next user. It made all of the difference in the world for us and I can't imagine going without it!"
21148,1,"I'm a huge fan of no-frills yet interesting mobiles, and this one fits the bill. There are 2 detachable animals, a mirror, and a ring with a chime. It is very colorful and can be hung from the ceiling with an s-hook. If you are looking for lights, music, and cheap plastic, this won't be the mobile for you. If you are looking for a cozy simple fabric mobile, this is a good investment (as are most Haba toys). Wish I'd bought this for my first child! One thing to note - it's a bit heavy, due to sturdy construction."
165104,1,"Great price for these diapers, even better with coupons, discounts and free shipping. Very fast delivery. Will buy from here again."
49648,1,Perfect plate and quick shipping! This was the second vendor on Amazon I bought this from. The first one never bothered to process or ship the order. These guys did a great job! Thanks!
87298,1,Well I am in the process of registering for bottles and these are the ones my mom had said to get-she actually used the originals with my sister (18 years ago!) I was just wondering about pumping...Do you have to pump into something else and then poor into the liners? And if for some reason we have to switch to formula do these do well with mixing formula? Just wondering-everyone else I know uses the Avent-but they seem to leak a lot-let me know!thanks
164865,1,This is my baby's favorite diapers.It fits very well and Flexes for a snug and comfortable fit.Ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection.
137990,1,"My son loves his turtle. It is a great night light, he left it on all night last night. The light is not too bright or overpowering, just enough so it's not completely dark in the room. I bought one of these from a popular auction site and paid 1/3 the price of amazon. They also sell these at Target for thirty eight USD."
79578,1,"I used this step ladder potty seat with our children and just bought another 23 years later for a grandchild. I like that you do not need to empty and wipe or wash out a potty bowl, rather, all business goes in the toilet, ready to flush. And, the kids like the ladder, once they get the hang of it.One downside is that the guard in front is a little low, making the boy need to lean forward forward so his urine stream doesn't overshoot the seat and go on the floor.Easy to assemble, handy to have beside the toilet. (Does not stay in place with the toilet lid lowered.)"
6542,1,"First off the new design on the diaper is cool. Not to say the old one was bad but its nice to see change. Pampers still work #1 as always. I mean 9 months and not a single explosion evar! FTW!The Amazon Subscribe 'N Save makes it so much easier to deal with baby supplies like Pampers. Instead of having to drive around to find good deals or worry about ""stock"" at your favourite Tegrat store you just get your Diapers on schedule when you need them and the prices are extremely competitive.Lastly having to lug around a huge box of diapers, fit them into the car, drive them home, and finally bring them in. That alone is a HUGE bonus to me. As they say time is money. I'd rather be spending my time with my baby at home rather than shopping."
136251,1,"We bought this exersaucer when my son was about 5 months or so. He's 7 and a half months old now. From the day we bought it, he has loved it! This saucer has everything an active child needs to keep busy. He loves to hit and pull the animals hanging down from the arch. He also loves the music that plays on the removable book portion of the saucer. When he hears the music he bounces and laughs. I find it nice that the book portion does come off, because it can be taken places or used on the floor during tummy time. I also enjoy the saucer, because it enables me to do some household tasks and know my son is occupied and safe. My husband, baby and myself all love this saucer and are very glad we purchased it. There was one thing I found a little surprising, and that was that it took longer than I expected to put together. It was not at all difficult to put together, but did take about an hour to do. I guess I just expected it to be somewhat easier, but like I said it was not a difficult task."
183675,2,"I was really excited to get this bag. It's made by skip hop, which makes great bags. Although it was a little small ( I could only fit two Dr. Brown bottles and a snack, no formula powder or ice packs), I liked the design. I like that it had a separate pocket out side and the mesh compartments inside. I like the extra long strap and a smaller strap that you can attach on your diaper bag.My husband didnt mind carrying it. So that was a bonus. I had no problems with the zippers, as mentioned before in other reviews.Unfortunately, my love for this bag came to an end when I had a few milk spills and realized that the bag was not washable. I mean...seriously? That's a huge flaw! I had about three bottle spills and all three spillled out of the bag and on to the outside material of the bag. It says to wipe it clean but the bag was drenched a few times. So I decided to hand wash it and when it dried it smelled horrible. I tried to clean it again and it smelled worse. So I had to throw it out and buy something else."
161643,1,"I do not know why other people have given this tub low ratings! It is the most wonderful baby tub I have found. I have had no trouble with leaks (I leave it ope all the time, closing it does not make it that much smaller) and the sling is a Godsend. My 4 month old daughter LOVES bath time but is a bit of a wiggler. She enjoys sitting in the sling and feeling the warm bath water wash over her. But her favorite is when I lay her on her stomach to wash her back. The sling helps keep her face out of the water but she can still splash with her hands. She is starting to sit up now so we will soon be retiring the sling and graduating to the green ring. I'm sure she will enjoy this too."
137249,1,"Comments about the product itself:- Another reviewer included the dimensions. I will just say, without measuring, that it is much larger than I expected--maybe half-again larger than the play gyms his little friends have. I've decided this is a good thing.- The mat has a plastic backing, so it can be used outside.- As mentioned, there are little orange plugs/stations all around, into which you can plug the 3 vertical play figures, and/or the bars of the gym. This is what allows so much flexibility. One small note, however--if you step on an empty plug with bare feet (or if baby rolls onto one), it's a pretty uncomfortable experience. I wish the manufacturer included some sort of cover (baby-proofed, of course!).- The plugs hold the toys very securely, at least so far as I've been able to tell.- The bars are very soft, not stiff like other gyms. At first, I was disappointed by this seeming lack of stability, because some of the toys we hang from them are a little heavy and cause them to sag. On the other hand, my son seems to like this, because it's easier for him to pull the toys close to him.- Unlike a lot of gyms with lots of activities, this gym focuses on toys, rather than lights/music. The mirror that hangs does have music, but neither my son nor I like the music. There are no light shows or anything, but that's fine with me.Comments about our experiences so far:Okay, I never write personal stories like this in reviews, but I have to share that we have had this play gym for 24 hours now, and my son has had three major breakthroughs!1. Within 5 minutes of lying down on it the first time, he rolled over from back to stomach. He'd never done this before! Whether he was interested in some of the toys around the gym and therefore motivated or whether it was complete coincidence, who knows! 24 hours later, he still only rolls over on this gym. ;)2. This morning, he played so hard, he fell asleep. He did this once in the Fisher-Price jumperoo, but fussed first. He was in the middle of trying to roll over again, and suddenly, wrapped right arouond the purple dolphin-thing toy, he was out![So you can imagine I am already a very happy mother.]3. He plays on this gym for 10 to 30 minutes at a time, even without my directly interacting with him (obviously I'm close by!). Of course, it's still new, but as other reviewers have pointed out, it has almost limitless configurations, which I think will really keep his interest up.In short, however, I would definitely recommend this gym. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could--very close to the perfect baby toy!"
144120,0,"I bought this chair for my 6 month old and the stokke chair for my toddler. While I do like both chairs, they are so much better than the stupid bulky plastic highchairs, and I kinda like the swan better for it's curved look, the stokke is a better chair.The problem is the crevices that are created by the way the chair is put together: they are IMPOSSIBLE to clean. The stokke has no such crevices. The other problem is the sturdiness. The swan has a single stem that supports the seat in the center, while the stokke seat is supported on either side of the seat. We just removed the highchair 'cage' part of the chair and I was using it the same way I use the stokke. I don't know if the seat actually can support adult weight but it certainly doesn't feel like it can. There was ominous creaking and swaying. The stokke feels like a chair and I never hesitate to plop down in it.Those are my major complaints-- but my youngest does now seem to prefer the stokke because she can very easily climb into it due to its wide seat bases. There is one problem with the stokke-- the base of the legs, which extend parallel to the floor do stick out enough to trip my husband every time if the chair is in a path. I would recommend both chairs but I wanted people to know the ups and downs I had discovered."

101624,1,"I ordered this monitor system for use with my 3 year old and newborn baby. Upon arrival and set-up, I noticed that one of the parent units was very scratchy and made popping noises. The other parent unit had a faulty LED light. I contacted the company via email and after a couple weeks, they told me to send the parent units back. I now have the new parent units installed and they work great. I also wish that they had the option of just switching between two of the baby units. To resolve the cycling issue,I keep two of the baby units in with my newborn, and the third unit with my preschooler. The reception has been great, and I have had minimal interference with other electronics. A great product for those with multiple kids."
76237,1,"I have used this for freezing breastmilk and have had no problems. Easy to fill, freeze, empty, and clean. I do have a level spot reserved in my freezer for my trays so I don't have to worry about spilling. I use this tray and the OXO tray and love them both. This tray take up a little less room if space is an issue for you."
174841,1,"This is baby nail clipper #4 that we've tried, and our search is finally over. It's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold. What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers?The losers:- Safety 1st model 49539 (has the holder for emery boards) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless. The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don't catch the baby's skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail. Plus, it's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby's nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!"
56430,0,"My kids are well behaved, but like any kid they are curious. These stopped them from messing with the knobs because it wasn't as easy and with gas, that's important for more reasons than fire or heat.They only get 3 stars because they aren't very heat resistant, and frankly are a pain in the butt on my island range because the knobs are so close together. Now, if that wasn't part of the point they'd get two stars. But that's actually a feature to some extent. Ultimately the kids are now old enough that they know better so they are off.They fit the knobs well, and cause issues even for an adult to use, so that stops the kids pretty well.In the end, they did their job and I'm not sure there is much out there that are better."
55618,2,"I bought this item for my first baby. To make a long story short, despite following directions very carefully, half the time the bottle either came out too hot, or still cold. I gave it up quick and ended up setting the bottle in a bowl of warm water from the microwave. Takes a little longer, but works everytime and it's not as annoying."
108940,0,"We bought this mattress for the DaVinci Emily.It fits very snugly. The mattress itself is medium tolow quality. It has no springs. It is covered in a plastic package whichresults in a loud ""crinkle"" sound whenever you touch it or the baby moves on it.Except for the snug fit, I would not recommend it."
55398,0,"The idea behind this product is great. You can store snack and other knicknacks.However, the most cost effective product to protect your seat is a thick cotton towel. I have been using that for five months and not one issue of damage or discoloration.Save your money and put it towards your child's college fund."
47022,1,"I was pleased with the quality of the product. I purchased this to put in my granddaughters room. We spelled out her name, nice quality! Sturdy to stand by itself."
54931,2,"Bought it because of the lower price. Now I know why it is cheaper. After using it about ten times, the side latch broke. Now I am stuck with it, can't get a refund so am going to have to buy another one. Buy a Graco. not an Evenflo."

56024,1,"This stroller is just great! Setting it up was fast and easy, though the instructions were just of pictures and not very helpful, but it was simple to figure out.I highly recommend this stroller, because it is easy to maneuver, durable, and just looks beautiful! Be prepared to hear a lot of compliments when you are out for a walk with your baby in this stroller! It also allows you to have your baby lay absolutely flat, which makes this stroller very suitable for your baby from the day he/she is born.At first it took a while to figure out how to fold it, but once you know how it is very simple and fast. The stroller is a little heavy to lift into your car, but it's not really that much of a problem and the handle is very helpful too. The wheels are very quiet and move even on roads with little rocks great.I also love that you can lay the baby flat in the stroller both ways, facing you or facing forward, and you can also attach the top both ways which makes it easy to keep the sun out of your baby's face, and of course to let her/him see the world. :)Well worth the money. Love it."
152916,2,The warmer doesn't do a great job of warming a bottle from an ice pak cooler or the fridge. You must take the bottle out of the cooler 30-45 minutes ahead of time then once the chill is somewhat off the bottle heat up the heat pack from the warmer and apply it. Even then it just barely warms the bottle to luke warm.
19307,1,"The snuzzler, coupled with the nojo baby cover up, kept our baby warm and cozy through the winter months. He often slept in his car seat next to our bed and I think he slept so well because he was so comfortable. When it became warmer, I turned it around to the fabric side because he started sweating a little, and it continued to work like a charm. You can put it in the high chair, anywhere else the baby is going to sit or sleep, it's extremely cushy."
38493,1,"This is one of my &quot;can't live without&quot; baby products. My son is now 2 months old and we have been using this product since he was born. It served as a soft place to put him for the early sponge baths. We now use it in the infant to toddler tub (it fits perfectly!)We pour the warm water over it and it stays warm. He loves his bathtime and smiles the whole time. It sure beats trying to hang on to a wet, slippery baby in a hard plastic tub. Please note that the picture is a bit misleading and they are not sitting up in the Safer Bather, but it can be propped up at an angle in the Infant to toddler tub. I highly recommend this item!!"
103807,1,"I love this item with my first son and I got them again for my second son. Great product, keeps them warm without getting overheated and then you don't have to worry about loose blankets at night."
10193,1,Fits perfectly on our toilet and is easy for our 23-month-old daughter to sit on securely. She can even put it on the toilet herself.
43288,1,"We put this together in a matter of minutes in the parking lot right after buying it, hardly glancing at the instructions. It fits easily into the trunk of either of our compact cars, and it opens and closes with hardly any effort. It has a smooth ride and maneuvers easily. The basket on the bottom is just the right size for our diaper bag and my purse. We love this and I'm so glad we went with it instead of a whole bulky travel system."
138947,1,"This is an incredible baby item. I bought this for my two month old and she absolutely loves it. I can put her in her crib while she's still wide awake, put on the twilight turtle and she'll fall asleep while staring at the stars. I now have to go out and buy one for my three year old-- he's obsessed with it. This will definately be my new baby gift for friends and family.I read in other reviews that the amber colored stars did not show up- while they are a bit dimmer than the blue and green mine shows up just fine on our ceilings at night. I also keep this on top of the changing table (at least four feet from our ceiling) and they show up great."
12937,0,"We bought this gate to keep our daughter out of the kitchen, rather than baby proofing the entire area. It says that it fits an opening up to 42 inches, which is what we needed. However, that is the max width and it tends to bow when you extend it that far. It works for now, as our daughter is only crawling, but I'm a bit concerned how it will do when she starts walking and running. We may end up investing in a wall mounted unit for a more secure gate."
92056,1,"I am very happy with this product. It definitely helps me to get more comfortable at night. I would recommend it to anyone who is pregnant and is having difficulty sleeping. I have only made it to 18 weeks, so I can't tell you how it will work the bigger I get, but for now it is great!"
153164,1,"Peg Perego Centro Completo Full Size Stroller in ToffeeWhen our darling grandson (DGS) outgrew his SnugRide car seat, we had to begin the search for a new stroller to replace the Snap N Go we used with the car seat. I really liked the light weight and ease of use on the Snap N Go, so I was looking for something that would give me similar features. Most important was weight, size of basket, ease of steering, pushing, etc., for less than $200.00. (We may be the Grandparents, but we are not loaded, so price is a big factor!)I really wanted a a Peg Perego P3, but the price, basket location, and size really put me off. I walked into a local store, and they the Peg Perego Centro Completo stroller on the floor, fully assembled. I put it through its paces in the store, and was tempted to buy it right then and there, but I knew I needed to do a bit more research on the weight of this stroller. So, I passed on picking it up right away, and went home to do my research. I found very little information on the web, and the weight information I DID find was a bit conflicting. I was able to determine that this model weighs 18 pounds, which was right where I needed it to be.I returned the next day and they still had it on the floor, so I got it for $159.00 plus tax. Now I wish would have waited, cause Amazon has it for about the same price, with no tax and free shipping, so I could have saved another $15.00 or so.We have used the stroller for the last few weeks, and have even taken it to the Chicago Auto Show. It has performed flawlessly, although the shuttle bus driver at the Auto Show tried to open it, and was not able to! (There is a little trick to it, but once you have it, it is easy!)The basket is huge, and easy to access! If the basket is not too full, it even folds up under the seat so a 2nd passenger can ride on the rear footbar. This stroller features the ""Freedom of Movement"" harness. Right now, our 7 month old grandson is not too wiggly, but I can see where it would benefit a more active chiild.Steering is a breeze, and it can be steered with one hand. The fold is easy, although it is NOT one handed. Unfolding it requires releasing the telescoping handle and giving it a little shake. There is a handle on the frame for carrying it while folded as well.The stroller comes with a boot and rain cover. We have found the boot handy in our wild winter weather here in Ohio, and I suspect the rain cover could come in handy as well.The canopy on this stroller is huge, and it folds completely over the seat, fully protecting a sleeping baby from the sun. The canopy also reverses, so you can use it as a pram with a smaller baby. The footrest and back rest are fully adjustable, which is nice for napping babies. I can also attest that the canopy held up great with 4 large adult winter coats thrown over it without sagging on the baby's head during the auto show!So far, we are very pleased with this stroller. The only negatives I can say that it is not as compact as I would like, as it takes up a lot of space in the trunk. But then again, it is a full-featured stroller, so its size is full-featured as well. There is only one adult cup holder, and no parent tray, although there is a zippered compartment on the canopy for parent ""stuff"" like cell phones or wallets. There is a child tray, but no child cup holder, so that might be an issue for some people, but not for us, right now anyway.Overall, I would give this a big thumbs up. Especially if you have a medium to large size trunk!"
179257,1,"On reviewer stated her newborn couldn't use the bottles well. I learned a trick for the problem when the baby is sucking but can't pull enough through Stage 1s. Cup your hand over the bottom of the bottle (the vent) and blow. The vents get clogged. You know if it loose if you can pinch the nipple and the milk streams out of the nipple. Pretty easy routine when checking the temperature. If it is clogged from formula settling, then milk won't stream out with a pinch test.My son loves these bottles, but started using them in combination with the Healthflow system when he was a newborn. Now that he is older he have a definite preference for the Vent-aire. He seems to burp less, likes the colors and doesn't spill or dripple as much formula. I would recommend these bottles, but be prepared if they have a hard time sucking, to use something like Healthflow for the first month."
70455,2,"After one washing, these blankets were so pilled that the pattern was obscured. The material is extremely thin, and the cut is irregular--when I folded them, they didn't line up properly.The only positive is that they were rather soft after washing. Nevertheless, there are many other blankets out there of better quality for the same price, or even less. I will probably only use these blankets as burp cloths, and wouldn't recommend them."
93921,0,"I thought the entire suit was made of nylon, but the pink (or blue) is made of wetsuit material. They're very stiff, but we have yet to use it."
175260,1,"I ordered these a few days ago and like them a lot, they seem to be of very good quality. And the lids close perfectly well. However the lids don't stack well on top of each other, they keep sliding, nor do they stack on top (or bottom) of the bowls. I had bought The First Years Take & Toss bowls and lids, and even though the quality is not the same, the lids stack perfectly well, so I prefer them for that reason."
145074,1,"I got this at my baby shower. It was sooo hard to wait to use this with my baby until he was 4 months old and had good head support to use it. I have read so many reviews of baby loving this and I couldn't wait to get my baby into it. When my baby was 3.5months old he had really good head support so I decided to put him in it. He really enjoys it, but only for a small time. Right now he is too short to reach the ground on the lowest setting so I have to put a pillow under his feet but he still likes to play with all the toys on the jumperoo.My son is now 4.5 months old and 24 inches long and is still too short to reach the ground. He is about an inch and half off the ground so he still uses a pillow. He loves the toys a lot. He likes to chew on the bug and grab at the monkey and bird. He has figured out that if he jumps just a bit it will trigger the jungle sounds and as soon as the jungle sounds stop he will jump just enough to have them go again. I think once he is big enough to not need the pillow under his feet anymore he will really get into this toy.Some of the things I don't like, It is hard to get him in the jumperoo. I lower him in the seat but he manages to keep his feet on the seat and not go through the leg holes. So I have to bend down and hold him to my shoulder to support him while I reach down with my other arm and guide his legs into the leg holes. It is awkward. Also, getting him out is hard. It is hard to really get a good hand hold on him to lift him out because he is surrounded by the jumperoo. Then pulling him out the seat part come out with him and some times his legs gets stuck on the leg holes and I have to untangle him from it. I wish it was easier to get him in and out of the jumperoo.Assembly is very easy. While my son was doing tummy time I was able to put this together before he got too cranky with tummy time. I say it took me about 15 minutes to put together. The instructions are really easy to follow. He did start getting cranky before I was able to put all the toys on so I put him in the jumperoo before I attached all the toys and he watched me as I snapped all the toys in place and then played with them with him. His first jump, with help from me, he was instantly smiling. He likes it the best when we bounce him up and down.I am going to give it five stars even though I have seat issues because I can get around that and my son really enjoys playing in the jumperoo. Plus, I think the more times I put him in it he will figure out himself to put his legs through the leg holes. So, I believe that won't be a problem in the future just taking him out will be a struggle."
72858,1,"This chair is great, one of the best purchases we've made. It goes everywhere with us (family's house, restaurants, etc.) and it is so convenient and easy to carry around!"
17151,2,"This unit dose not have the range that the manufacture claims it has(300'), and the background noise is terible. Don't waste your money on this unit or the Safety 1st unit. Go to Lowe's (Home Improvment Warehouse)and get the 2.4 GHz Sylvania for $100."
30737,1,"I LOVE these monitors! I had registered for the Fisher Price Sound and Lights monitors; however, when I tried them out they were horrible. I live in a large neighborhood of townhouses and the static was enough to drive me crazy. Long story short, on my third try with the baby monitors, I thought I would go for it and spend the money and boy am I glad I did. The sound quality awesome! They pick up even the softest noise and there is no feedback or static. I even learned another trick of the trade...Put the transmitter unit UNDER the crib, that way it's out of the way and not taking up space on the dresser. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money."
124145,1,Great bubble bath for little girls. My daughter has very sensitive skin and this bubble bath does not irritate her skin at all. Not to mention using just one cap full produces a large amount of bubbles which my kids just love. The bubbles do not disintigrate they stay around for a long time. Much better than cheap bubble bath which loses it's bubble power in about 5 minutes.
61784,1,"After doing my homework, I decided I'd probably like this seat. My husband didn't understand my insistence in driving all over looking for this seat but once we sat my son in it he was sold. It was the only seat we found in stock that offered real side impact protection plus the weight range that allows us to use this seat longer than the two we've previously invested in. Should have bought one from the start! I do have drawbacks, however. 1: My son has a long torso so it's not a perfect fit. 2: It's a little bulky; just barely fits the backseat of our F150 when reclined. My 16 month old son (26 lbs, 34 inches)has no complaints about being in the seat though, which makes it the best investment we could have made."
64417,1,"We purchased this carrier for our trip to Ft Davis, Texas where a lot of hiking is involved. My husband, who is 6ft 2in. had no problem with it at all. It fit him perfectly and he said it was very comfortable. Also our 1 year old daughter who weighs 21 lbs. loved riding up high and being able to see everything. The only down side to it is there is little storage space but that really wasn't a problem for us seeing as I had a back pack with me that carried all of our 5 kids things in it. So all in all a good product at a good price. I would recommend it to anyone."

129819,1,I love my snugride. I got a second adaptor for our other car. The car seat transfers easily from car to cart to stroller. Makes life a little easier when it becomes quite hectic.
103774,2,"There are too many problems with this gym:1) In continuous play mode, the sounds and motion are disjointed. While one song is playing, something else starts playing over it. It was disturbing to me, and she was not interested at all once it started jumbling up.2) In baby-activated mode, it's impossible to tell how to make something happen -- batting at the toys doesn't consistently get results. Sometimes hitting the one on the right will make music play; sometimes it won't. There were times that I got down in the floor and tried hitting all of them without results (even with brand new batteries).3) On top of that, it's very hard to trigger the dangling toys. Our baby couldn't make them work, even though she plays with other floor gyms and understands how to bat at things to make them come on.4) It is way too loud with no volume control. And when Elmo pops out to say ""peek-a-boo, baby,"" we both nearly jumped out of our skin. There is a long enough lull between when he hides and when he jumps back out that I thought the action was over. It just didn't make sense.I like the idea of a gym she can play on while laying down, then sitting up, then standing, but this is not the one. She cannot learn anything from this particular gym (cause and effect does not apply here!), and she was not even entertained. We returned it and bought the Baby Einstein Lights and Melodies Activity Center, which works on the same principle, but actually works. Our four-month-old loves it and plays with everything on it, although not necessarily the way it was intended to be played with."
131454,1,This item should be on every baby shower or baby registry list ! I received this as a gift and have used it every day . This pillow has made nursing so much more rewarding because it eases the strain on mother's arms and back and it supports the baby when newborn and as it grows . It allowed me to relax with safety and comfort. Being washable and having extra covers available gives this pillow a long life.
167742,0,My husband lost all the sheets and mattress for the our basinett after our first child grew out of it. So with the birth of our second child coming soon it was next to impossible to find these things in any of our local stores in the size needed to fit. It was nice to find them so readily available on the internet. My only problem was the time it took to mail out these items and for them to get to me (almost 2 weeks).
29153,0,"This is fairly small. My 2-year old won't be able to use it for the potty or the sink for quite some time. Also, I thought being BabyBjorn would mean great design, however it is tippy if she stands off-center."
34526,1,"I have used this diaper pail for 2.5 months with twin babies. We go through a LOT of diapers ;) This pail has done a nice job. The only time I have smelled an odor is if the pail is full to the top and the pop-lid is left open. I really like the capacity to deal with double diapers of twins. I also have a Diaper Champ and I prefer this diaper pail over the Champ. They perform about the same, but the capacity of the Safety 1st Pail makes it a winner for me."
42964,0,"I think the Moby Wrap has a lot of potential, but possibly not for my baby. As much as she likes being held, she really doesn't like being wrapped up for more than 5 minutes on a good day. I watched videos and tried different holds to see which one would work for her and I think I'm doing everything right, but she just gets very upset either immediately or a few minutes after I put her in there. I can say though that the concept is great and during those few minutes that she lasts in the wrap, it is very comfortable and I can get some things done. I wish though she would fall asleep in it like other babies supposedly do, so we'll keep trying. If anyone had similar experiences and succeded later on, I would welcome any suggestions."
39044,0,"I bought these along with Gerber Waterproof Pants. These are HUGE compared to the Gerber for the same age. I checked to make sure they actually sent me size small. I've kept them, and plan to use them when she gets bigger. Just know the sizing is not correct. I'd guess these are more like mediums."
109672,1,"Soap has never mattered to me. I normally walk into Target and grab the cheapest soap available. But a friend gave me this soap as a gift, and I love the jasmine and flowers smell. But the best part of this soap is how it feels. It is very smooth and velvety, and leaves my dry skin feeling softer and more supple after I shower.Sometimes, I want to soap myself twice just to experience it all over again...I'm looking forward to trying the other products from this company."
20758,1,"I only occasionally feed my baby, and my apartment doesn't have a dishwasher. I usually decide right before going out that I want to take a bottle, so this disinfects everything really quick - in 3 minutes. As opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes. ANd I don't use it every days, so I don't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz I would have to sterilize it again right before using."
54470,1,I chose this mobile becuase it looked more interesting that the usual cutsey mobiles. I also love the fact that it would play for so long. I have to say that my baby loves the mobile and the music is rather soothing. I haven't had any issues with the mobile such as creaking or having it break down on me. I have purchased a number of items produced by this company and I have to say that I haven't had any issues or complaints in the past. I can honestly say that the mobile is a godsend because it's entertaining and the music plays for such a long time.
104550,1,"This swing is wonderful for kids and pets of all kinds. The extension rods help with fitting between doors or hallways, and gives easy access through the gate. I would definitely recommend this purchase!"
152236,1,I received my order within three days and received excellent service. i will definatly use this company again.
103387,0,"I purchased two of these gates 8 months ago to try to protect my 2 year old from climbing up and down the stairs in our home. Both gates have worked perfectly until the lock mechanism on our top of stair gate broke suddenly. One day while turning to open the gate, I heard what sounded to be a ""spring"" fall out of place inside of the lock mechanism. The gate is now stuck in the lock position. Needless to say, this ""safety gate"" has now become one of the most dangerous things in the house. We litterally have to climb over the gate to get up and down the stairs. I feel that this gate has become a hazard and should be recalled due to the danger this has posed in our household. After reading other review's on this site - It looks as if others are expieriencing the same problems. I am in the process of writing the company to communicate my frustration."
179676,2,"This travelmate finally works and it is not easy on and easy off....at least not for the Evenflo Triumph carseat that I have. The platform the seat rests near or on is slight. The straps that are included do not hold the seat securely to the rolling plate. We would have it all attached and the seat would fall off the edge of the slight platform as soon as we lifted the handle. We finally went out and bought a tarp strap and laced it in through the seat belt holes of the carseat and were able to cinch it in place. We then used a couple of the pieces included with the travelmate and finally the seat was able to hold my 33 pound child without us fearing that the seat was going to fall to the ground. The best piece of equipment that came with this was the handle itself. With the push of the button, the handle lifts to 2-3 different heights. I gave it 2 stars because of the time and effort that must be taken to work with the Triumph 5 carseat."
103379,0,"We bought this gate after reading the raving reviews about it and thought it would be suitable for use at the top and bottom of the stairs. While I do agree that it is a safe gate, the installation was not as easy as we were led to believe. My husband is very handy and knowledgeable about these things, and it took him an hour and a half (and a lot of swearing) to get this thing set up properly. If you're up for the challenge, then it's the gate for you. Otherwise you might want to consider something easier to install."
3965,0,"The best thing about this booster chair is that it is compact, folds up easily & is relatively light. We were able to travel with it by packing it in our suitcase. Initially we were concerned that the straps may not be sturdy enough to remain firm on the chair that it's strapped to, especially with our 10 month old son squirming in it. But the straps are sturdy and keep the booster chair secure on the regular chair.The only down side is that, because of it's soft fabric, my son sometimes ends up slouching in the booster chair.Overall, this chair works well for travelling or occasional use and is priced reasonably at under $20."
166526,1,"Good price but no wet indicator. It's thinner than the new diapers with wet indicator. Would have preferred to have the indicator, but for the price it's not bad"
75919,0,"These nipple covers will cover your actual nipple only to make it look like you have even bigger nipples. These covers aren't thin enough to be worn with anything except thicker shirts. Not safe to wear them in the summer when we need them most, so we can wear our thin tanks, shirts and dresses. It would be more classier to wear a bra and let it show than nipple covers that make us look like we have enough nipple for 2 women on each breast."
167264,1,Britax has great products so all I can say about this carseat is that its color is a lot darker than I thought. This is our second Britax marathon carseat for our second child so we only had it for a couple of months. So far so good.
158141,1,"Both of my girls had reflux when they were born and they would literally stop breathing while they slept...very scary. With my first one I just never slept and with my second one my husband and I would ""stand watch"" until my Mom bought us this monitor! What a life saver ;) I HIGHLY recommend this product to every one...put it on your baby registry for sure!!!!"
174726,1,"This set is adorable! With courdoroy and denim details, great colors, and soft durable fabrics. My only complaint would be that there are not many options built into this set for accent colors. Your pretty limited to blue and biege/yellow, although there is some deep red. Overall I would say it is a quality product, and an attractive set for the price."
16102,1,"We used it for the first time today and I absolutely love it! :) It's big enough, not too heavy and easy to fold. I'm glad I bought it! :)"
40199,2,"I bought a box back in October and noticed they had a rough stiff feel to them on the outside and the mesh liner was gone. I was told by P&G that it a was a thing they were trying and not a permanent change. Well, the geniuses at P&G have decided to run with it and it IS a permanent change now - just in time for me to have spent $60 on diapers that suck. There is no absorbent material on the backside of the diaper at all, the mesh liner is gone, and they feel stiff instead of soft. I called P&G and spoke with customer relations and emphatically voiced my anger over this move - I have been using these diapers for years on my children and have loved them up until now. These diapers really are horrible. My son has been leaking through the outer liner and I never had that problem before this fall - and I used to let him fill those up pretty far sometimes. My other son is in Swaddlers, and I just bought a new box and they feel stiff too, and there also is no absorbent material on the back of the diaper at all! How do they expect these to work?"
7738,0,The fragrance is fine. (Not without a reason that this is one of the leading sellers). But the juice is very weak and all gone from my skin in no time. Is that why this is selling for 1/2 price on Amazon? 3 stars for the fragrance part.
23727,1,"We use this chair at restaurants, bars and at home. So far we haven't found a place where the chair couldn't clamp on. Our son has been using it since he was 5 months old and loved being at the table with us. Easy to carry, easy to setup. Can't do without it."
68926,1,"I tried a bunch of different brands of diapers (Huggies, Luvs, White Cloud) and the Pampers Swaddlers/Cruisers keep in the leaks the best. They are also the easiest to change - the stretchy sides make them fit SO much better! Plus, for the price on Amazon and free shipping if you spend $25, it's cheaper than buying in bulk at Sams or Babies R Us. It also saves me a trip to the store (which is KEY with an infant)!"
81777,1,"We opted to put this on a dresser in lieu of getting a dedicated changing station. It's been a great space saver. I wish the covers were a bit less expensive. Nonetheless, our baby really likes the pad. He stops crying when placed on it and often ""warms"" up as well. Maybe it's the height, maybe its something on the ceiling or wall nearby... who knows."
78620,1,"I recently traveled alone with my 2 year old son. I knew I had to bring his car seat on the plane to keep him confined, but I wasn't sure how I was going to manage him and everything else I needed on my own. This worked very well. Two problems I ran into were 1) I had to disassemble the cart seat and suitcase every time we went through a security check and 2) you need to be sure you have a durable suitcase with strong wheels and handle to support both the car seat and your child. I would reccommend this product. Happy Traveling!"
127734,2,"No, not cheap cheap like a baby bird. Cheap cheap as in worst than that mid-90's ""European furniture super store"" cheap. The back board you see in the picture was broken when I took it out of the box. Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if it was made of balsa wood and no thicker than a regular card board box. It is definitely tiny too -- barely any ground clearance. Even if it wasn't broken, I wouldn't have felt safe placing my toddler in it. I sent it back and didn't ask for a new one -- just a refund please."
83707,2,"The hospital lactation consultants really pushed this item. Know that this is detrimental to your milk supply. The baby cannot successfully compress the sinuses around the nipple if he latches on to this shield as he will suck more like he would a bottle. It took me 5 very long and frustrating weeks to wean my baby from this thing. That was time I could have spent enjoying my baby rather than fighting with him. Giving him whole, natural breast milk is extremely important to me or I would have given up and just went to formula. A friend of mine gave up on breast feeding all together when faced with the same problem. The same consultants at the same hospital pushed it on her as well.If you have flat or inverted nipple know that you do not need an aid. Your baby knows no other nipple and will figure it out. Once the La Leche League leader in my area told me this, it gave me the strength to go for weaning my baby from it."
106863,2,"I have to say I'm very disappointed in the Diaper Champ. I agree it's easy to use, but the first dirty diaper and the whole room stinks. Isn't one of the big reasons you have it is to keep the room smelling fairly good? We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks! This is our first baby so I have not tried any other product yet, but I would NOT recommend this one!"
9749,1,"This potty chair has far exceeded my expectations. I now have two in my home. The two most important characteristics of this chair are that it&#8217;s very comfortable and easy to use for the child, and SUPER easy to clean for the parents. I would recommend this potty chair to any parent looking to make potty training as simple and easy as possible!"
116072,1,"Very functional high chair. It's worth the money, easy to install, easy to clean, easy to move around and keep still. And very stylish, too. We recommend this to modern parents who are looking for both functionality and style. We like its adjustable height. Some other 'high' chairs are not so high but Boon chair is really up to it. We should have bought it earlier :) Room for improvement: material & design of the safety belt."
84066,1,LOVE LOVE LOVE this gate!!! It's perfect for the top of my stairs. It IS loud IF you don't hold down the button when retracting the gate.
64027,1,"I love, love, love, the kiddopotamus swaddle me and i have several in several sizes for my baby.(one to wash and one to wear in each size- small and medium:) Its fabulous since it has an opening in the back for the carseat, so there is no need to wake baby when putting her in her carseat. Babies jerk when they sleep and it wakes them up (a newborn reflex) so this is a must-have! When your baby gets older, I recommend the miracle blanket, beacuse they can't squirm out as easily. Hope this helps!"
143578,1,"The cover fits fairly well for our Instep double jogging stroller, just a little big. I didn't find the odor to be too strong at all, was able to use it the day after receiving it."
171871,1,"I have used this tub since my baby was a week old. It feels as though the tub was just made for her. I loved the sling when she was too small. And used both the baby and the toddler side of the tub and have had fun bathing her. I have never felt that the tub was unsafe, may be because my baby is less wiggly than any average baby of her age.I would recommend this to any tub to any mother who plans to use it for a year. Yeah, it does get a little cramped for the toddlers but I never felt that my kid was uncomfortable in the tub (She is 95 percentile in height).Overall it's a great buy! I have had a lot of friends use much more expensive tubs and still complaining."
22201,0,"The adapter works fine but the bags are terrible. I was using the Lansinoh bags and pumping into the bottle then pouring into the bags. This worked fine but i thought the adapter and pumping straight into the bags would be convenient. I purchased the adapter with Medela bags and used it for the first time today. I would NOT recommend the Medela Pump & Save Breastmilk Bags. They are a very stiff bag that is awkward to work with (and the bag is noisy when pumping at work). The Medela bag only has one zipper closure at the top of the bag and it is difficult to zip. I am afraid they will eventually cause a big mess by me not knowing the bag isn't fully zipped.I also ordered some Oxo-Biodegradable Honeysuckly Breast Pump Bags and they seem to be much more durable. The bag is much softer, pliable and easy to work with. It also has the double zipper like the Lansinoh bags. These also hold an ounce more than the Medela bags.I'm glad I got the pump adapter but it looks like I ended up paying $18 for just that since I won't be using the bags."
183959,1,"I have twin boys and luvs are a good value. I have never had a leak or blowout with them. I've used Huggies and they always leak! The one thing I have noticed with Luvs is they run small. I compared them to several otherdiapers and a size 4 is the same as a size 3 in other brands(Target and Sam's Club). My boys are 5 months and just shy of 18 pounds. They wear size 3, but if I get Luvs, I need to get a size 4. They are a bit chunky in the thighs!"
130069,1,"My son is only five weeks old and I have been putting him in this swing since he was two weeks. At first he wasn't able to enjoy the mobile portion much, but the rocking always calms him or puts him to sleep. Now that he's a little older, he's begun to focus on the fish and the mobile. This is the only ""toy"" he has that will keep him calm for at least a half hour. I can't wait until he's a little older, as I'm sure the swing will continue to entertain him.I also own the following Ocean Wonders toys and would highly recommend them to any mom:1. ocean wonders mobile with remote2. ocean wonders aquarium3. high chair4. rockin aquarium gym"
39924,1,"From the moment our son arrived, we used this product. It is on almost all day and throughout the entire night. I have only used the ""ocean sounds"", even though there are so many nice options. Ocean sounds is the most soothing for my son and I don't want to throw in another sound just yet, since he's enjoying this one so much (as am I!). I registered for this product as a fluke and had no idea how essential it would become. I am so happy with it. I don't think that it needs to get any louder, but we live in a smaller house and I don't even turn it all the way up. Overall, super product and all babies would benefit from it."
106287,1,"Why go to the trouble and expense of buying THEIR plastic bags?!? This product is great. I have had no problem with smells. My older child loves the way it works and is more than willing to ""feed"" the champ...which is a big help to me when I am changing her brother somewhere that is not in close proximity to the champ. While it is not an unattractive pail...for me, it could be a bit smaller."
53173,0,"It has a water filled bladder in handle to ""keep food cool"". First, I doubt it would really keep it too cool for long. But the thing I noticed is that when I cleaned it, food got stuck in the crack between the handle and bladder. I had to scrape it out with a toothpick and am not sure I got it all or just crammed it in further. I really liked it over the other sasy one I bought because it was a little bigger. It was easier to cram a banana end into it. I got lots of extra bags so I will be using it still but am a little worried. The bags are hard to clean, but not too bad. Do not try to dishwash them because it just did not work. I have washed them by hand and then sterilized them in my steam bags; I do not know if I needed to sterilize them really but it did not hurt. I do not think I could sterilize the handle because of the bladder. I do not know though."
41469,0,"what happened?? pampers cruisers changed their long time staple diapers, and definitely NOT for the better. my son is getting diaper rash for the first time EVER, and they just aren't as absorbent."
6970,0,"I have been using pampers for my 15 month old daughter since birth. They are much softer and comfortable than Huggies that are stiff and rough. Pampers are also far more leakproof than any other diapers. I was 100% satisfied and a loyal customer to pampers till I ordered my last pack of Pampers cruisers size 6. They looked different and lightweight than before,which in fact was not a good change as they have taken out the granules from the base that made they highly absorbant. Since then my daughter has had two leak incidents. I had lately read a customer's review who was utterly disturbed at this change by pampers. Now I completely understand and can empathize. I am thinking about going to huggies little movers as I can buy them in bulk at Costco. Why pay more when its not worth it. Pampers has disaapointed me.I can't say if change in quality is true for all sizes though!"
161201,1,"We have always bathed my son in the Sure Comfort deluxe infant to toddler bathtub that we received for our baby shower and never had a problem...until he turned 5 months old. He is big for his age (29 inches, 19lbs) but did not fit in either the infant or toddler end of that tub, which left us searching for a new one. He hated to be lying down, so that ruled out the bath sponges. He already grew out of one infant bathtub, so I wasn't about to buy another. We had a non-skid surface on the bottom of our tub, which ruled out the seats that required suction cups. That basically left us with two options, the EuroBath and this one. After reading the reviews on this tub, it seemed like some worked and some didn't. So, I figured that since it was priced far more reasonably than the EuroBath, I would try my luck with this one first. I am very glad that I did.My son absolutely loves this bathtub! He cannot sit on his own yet, so I purchased a bear shaped yellow sponge that I put in the seat to cover the bottom and back of it, and it supports him wonderfully. Since I began using this tub in the &quot;stage 3&quot; (using the blue or green ring that goes around the baby) I am not sure how well it works in the other stages, but it suits our purpose perfectly.Thus far, we have had no problems with leaking once my husband secured the locks, but it was no small task. I also do not shorten the tub for storage, but instead use the suction cups to hang it on the wall inside the shower. I have had no problems with mildew, but this could be because I hang on the wall to dry, or possibly just good luck.The only reason I gave the product four stars instead of five was the difficulty of the locking clips and the fear of this thing leaking. I think that if Safety 1st creates another model of this tub that DOESN'T shrink for storage, they will have a perfect product. That alone will eliminate the leaking and assembly problems that seem to be most common. All in all, it was a good buy and we are very satisfied with this product."
85767,0,"Then started falling off the tile.. not sure why, maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it worked fine for a month."
71048,1,"I received this rocker as a shower gift, and I didn't use it a lot when my son was an infant (only every once in a while). However, my son is 19 months old now and he LOVES to sit in it. He really started using it at around 14 months or so. It's great because it's HIS chair that fits him perfectly! I love it because he loves it."
21526,1,"I am so excited about this product! My baby daughter always wanted to play with the faucet, and I was constantly having to slide her away from it and tell her no. With The Baby Bath Gate, I no longer have to struggle with my baby. We just have a good time. The gate is really easy to use. You just put it in the tub and you're set. My baby can't move it at all. This product is amazing!"
30760,1,"Old analog monitors picked up the local radio station signal 24/7.Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor is quiet with no radio pickup ...Now, I hear only the sounds in the room made by my disabled wife."
37066,0,"Like other reviews, I noticed the Consumer Reports evaluation of this seat. My wife had already purchased the seat to give our oldest daughter room to grow (she is now three). I had a terrible time with the straps twisting, the material just seemed to thin. With my schedule, I didn't have the time to untwist until I put her in the car. She often found the straps uncomfortable.To be fair to Consumer Reports, they only gave it a top rating as a booster seat. Of the ones that they tested, it performed the best as a booster, it held onto the seatbelt better than the rest.We are keeping it for use as a booster, but will probably look for a different brand for our youngest as the straps twist. Since my oldest loved to help buckling herself in, it was often difficult to accomplish. She got pretty good, but the twisted straps made the tension difficult to connect to the buckle without loosening every time."
27175,1,Great cupholder. Mount it to the outside of the stroller so that you can fold the canopy without hitting it!
157376,1,Really nice...one thought...diaper warmer needed to be plugged in and we had to take off the back panel and leave off. Not that much work but would be nice if there were holes for electrical cords.
135412,0,"The monitor is ok, no interference so far and the 2 receiver is a good solution. But the sound is not very loud (problem that can be minimized if you point the mic to the baby - but is needed to block the strong green light w/ a black tape) and because of that you need to leave the volume as high as possible sometimes (and a zzzzzzzzzz stays on forever).Before this one I had a Sony Babycall NTM910 that have some really nice features not available on this Gracco: built-in rechargeable battery, voice activated (no sound on the reciever while the baby is quiet) - but the interference was a problem.PS1.: I do listen wellPS2.: After a few weeks the interference appeared. I live in the city, in a apartment, w/ a lot of ""neighboors"" around. May be in the suburbs the problem wouldn't exist."

65401,0,"I bought this cream based on my friend's recommentation and all purchasers reviews. But it doesn't work for my daughter. I've been using this product last five days and her skin seem to be more dry. It works as so-so moisturizer but not for eczema cure, at least for my daughter."
66404,0,"This is nice but a bit too long because it drags about an inch on the floor. The first one I ordered was not the ""jumbo"" and it was too small so I ordered this one. I can use it but have tucked the extra fabric underneath the mattress, it's not a perfect solution but the baby is coming any minute so we'll keep this.. The eyelet and design is very nice but doesn't lend itself to being hemmed."
154424,0,"I'd used these happily for a couple of years until my last order, when I discovered that 7th Gen not only reduced the number of wipes per package but also significantly decreased the size of each wipe to the point that it becomes much harder to keep one's own hands clean when using them. And of course, this results in more wipes being used-- hence, even more expensive and also less green. So I'm switching brands."
50754,0,"It helps for part of the night but not the entire night. I agree with others that it really does not breath well and contributes to feeling hot when you wake up for your frequents trips to the loo. This is my second pregnancy; I thought I was being so smart this time around to have a total body pillow but like the first, I could live without it. With that said, I have consistently used it since I purchased it but only for about half the night and then it is tossed to the floor. I was 6 months along when I purchased it and am now due anyday. For the $, it is not a bad price."
180747,1,"I purchased this activity mat from Amazon a few months ago for my son and while he loves the mat, I do have some lingering questions.1. What caused the rainbow to shoot out of the giraffe's head? Does it hurt him? Is it indicative of a super power?2. I can identify the monkey, the birds and the fish on the mat, but what are the other two animals? I suspected that one was a zebra, but my husband insists it is a snow tiger. That seems ridiculous...this is the jungle, people. The other one might be a cheetah, but it has hooves. I like to verbally label things as my son looks at them but these two have me stumped.3. Why must I violate the giraffe, who already seems to be in some distress due to the rainbow situation, every time I need to replace the batteries?On the bright side, I think this mat will come in very handy during lessons on tolerance and the ethics of scientific experimentation on animals."
166109,1,"These work great, I have been using them for my baby boy who was born 7 lbs and is now 10 lbs. The only time we have leaks is when we dont change him at every feeding.The only drawback of these pampers is they dont have the wetness strip. That being said after 2 months of diaper changes I can tell without the strip when he is wet."
162853,2,"For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house.On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess."
31286,0,It's overall pretty good! Except my bottles are glass ones. After about 2 months those plastic sticks became bended and they can't be straightened up. And 8 oz bottles can't stand up in the container.
55065,0,"I totally agree with other Moopy410!This sling hangs more around my neck than on my shoulder and it HURTS! My 4 week old son is 9lbs and it is true that using the safety harness makes his head bend to one side to fit in. However reading the other reviews I will now try to use it without the harness, maybe then his head will situate straight without bending. Besides, his head does also get lost in it and does cause you to think twice about suffocation. Other than that he does sleep nicely in it. And since I only got it recently I will work with it for a while before I rush to return it."
65875,2,"When I first found out I was pregnant everyone told me to use Dr. Browns. They all said they are the best bottles and that nothing compared. My son has execlusively used them for two months now and I think the hype is not all its cracked up to be. Simply stated they leak. I will go to feed him an half an ounce will pour out all over his clothes. Also, everytime I go out I have to put the bottles in a ziploc bag just to prevent them from leaking all over the diaper bag. I am very frustrated with them and I am switching to Playtex Ventaire they work just as well and they don't leak."
71250,1,"I have a 2 year old and a 5 month old and bought this because my toddler kept sitting in all his old baby toys to protest our family's new addition. I needed a bouncer that wouldn't break when he sat in it. Enter this little beauty. The first time my toddler sat on it, looked at me for signs of distress, and saw nothing but peace was a five star experience."
146284,1,"My baby girl loves this jumper. I love it because before I purchased it, she would try to jump on mommy....not a lot of fun. Now she can bounce to her hearts delight without bruising me. :)It was very easy to assemble, though my husband had trouble since he is allergic to instruction manuals like any typical male. It does fold, though I dont fold it very often. All in all, I would buy this product again in a heartbeat. It is cheaper than others and worth every cent."
178347,1,"My son would only stand it for 5 to 10 minutes and I had to hold the bottom of his feet and push up, but that was the first several times. He loves it now. I always use it when walking the dog. The only problem I have is what to do when it gets cold. I am not a small person and the straps are at their limit, so I just checked their website for extension straps and could not find them. This will never fit over my winter jacket."
161218,1,"Honestly, I did not put the tub together for the 1st time. My husband did. I will say though it only took him a couple minutes and we have NEVER had a problem with leaking. It's great b/c it saves you the money and hassle of buying several different bath products. Plus, it compacts so you don't have to worry about having several different bath products to store once your baby has grown out of it. My only complaint is that with all of the groves, cleaning can be a little difficult. The groves are gonna come with any infant bath product though."
148567,1,"I haven't slept this well in months! I have been using this pillow for about a week and the difference in how I sleep is amazing! I no longer wake up with hip/side/back aches, and I actually sleep through the night!I feel much more rested. The back support is great. You also don't feel like your belly is hanging over either. The pillow also makes it much more difficult for the mommy-to-be to end up on her back which is a pregnancy no-no.I just started my 6th month and wish I had purchased it alot sooner!!Yes, it is a bit large and my hubby says I look like I sleep in a blow-up raft..but HEY! whatever it takes to get a good nights sleep..they will soon be a thing of the past!"
4500,0,"I'm giving 2 stars for really good fit. If the pad was made of cotton (as I thought) I would give 5 stars. When I first read an ad on this product it said ""100% cotton"" - that was the only purpose I decided to buy this pad. Summer here is very hot and I wanted a nice natural pad under my 7 months old boy's sheet that whould be really breathable. I was very disappointed to find out that cover is 80% polyester, and filling 100% poly. This quality I could had bought for half of this price."
99481,1,"works great for my 20 month old, and they're cheaper than most competitors. It's worth getting them here. would order again."
112652,0,"This is a good size box for our usage. Living in the city we do not have much storage space, so these keep me from running out of diapers every week, but at the same time don't take up too much space. The diapers in the last couple of orders have been leaving lint on my baby, but this set seems better."
83064,1,"Our yellow lab mix has gone through three wooden gates, and it became clear he was not going to outgrow his puppy chewing phase. We bought this gate based on the positive reviews and couldn't be more pleased. It was easy to install and our dog doesn't even try to get out. We could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation and expense if we had just bought this gate first. Oh well, better late than never!"
165655,0,"My son is 22 pounds but has already outgrown size 4 Pampers diapers in height. Although the description says the diapers are good until 28 pounds. I ordered the next size 5 but in height they are almost identical to size 4, they are just made to accomodate more weight. So we will be switching to Huggies, in Huggies he still fits into size 4 with some room to grow!Meanwhile we used Pampers for 3 months and they were great. Almost no accidents, soft to the touch, smells powdery but not overpowering and price through amazon can not be beat. I just wish they took taller babies into consideration!"
63139,1,"What you see is what you get - except - the picture does not do justice to the sturdiness of this product. It is really well crafted, sturdy, and capable of holding not only toys but can be used as a chair. We have the kidKraft table and chairs as well and we are so pleased that I would say anything by KidKraft is a winner. The hinged lid works very well and eliminates the fear of having the lid slam down on the head of our 2-year old granddaughter. She loves to pick up her toys now before she goes home. It has also become her ""quiet place"" where she can sit and think and look out the window, waiting for mommy and daddy to come home."
50483,1,"I had more severe numbness and some hip discomfort with my second pregnancy. This pillow eliminated them both! In fact, I slept so well with it, my husband would &#34;steal&#34; it for himself. He even slept better!"
7843,1,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. We had just gotten her a full size bed and of course, didn't want her falling out. It was a little hard to get to stay clicked on top, but we did get it done. The only problem you are supposed to be able to let it down when not needed, which you can, but I guess her mattress and boxspring are not thick enough or the frame is not high enough because we don't have enough room to let it down. I hits the floor 12 inches from the bed. We could raise the frame but then the bed would be hard to get in and out of for her."
33365,0,"These were good for sore nipples, although the instructions say not to use them for more than 40 minutes at a time to prevent excessive pressure on your milk ducts. The first 2 - 3 weeks you are sore almost 24 hours a day. I did not have any success on using them to catch leaking milk, as they are not shaped right for all nipple types and the milk leaked out under them into my bra. As for saving the leaked milk, the instructions say that you are only supposed to save the milk you collect during breastfeeding; you are supposed to throw any other milk away, as it could have become contaminated. When my son was about 3 months old I quit leaking altogether, even when he was nursing on the other side, so I never use them anymore. Not the best purchase, but great for the first two weeks or so."
80176,1,"I have bought various pacifiers for my daughter, however Avent's are the only pacifiers she takes. As for me, I like the design a lot :) We have already being using such pacifiers for 4 months and it is the second time I buy 6-18m pacifiers for her."
76414,2,"I was very excited to use the positioner and it really helped keep my little one in place. But, after the very first time in the washing machine, the foam insert began to crumble into pieces. Also, it is very hard to reassemble after washing/drying. Then, the second time through (the wash) caused a big hole in the middle of the positioner. It looked like someone took a huge bite, not to mention all of the foam I had to clean out of my washing machine. I would definitely not buy this item, and am going to look for more sturdy positioners."
32579,1,"We just received our Hearth Gate yesterday and set it up yesterday evening. I am already very pleased with it. It was easy to install and is just what we needed to protect our boy from our fireplace and sharp brick hearth. We got a 24"" extension for it to fit (we have a large hearth), and it was simple to add. It's very sturdy, great quality, and it gives me peace of mind to know that we have it. I highly recommend it."
99278,2,"Will not buy again, save your money and just buy LUVS, the only advantage the baby dry have is that they smell good. We went thru almost twice as many diapers trying to keep our baby dry.lol"
52957,1,"We purchased this while expecting, and were very glad we had it when our baby was a newborn. He refused to sleep in his crib, either because it was big and scary, or because he couldn't comfortably lay flat. He slept easily and soundly in the papasan, and we could fit the whole papasan in the crib to get him used to it.Pros:1. Comfy and holds baby at a good angle.2. No bright colors or distracting toys.3. Can be used from 7-15 pounds, at least.4. Vibrate setting is just right, and not annoyingly loud.5. Music is also not annoying.6. Cover removes easily for cleaning.Cons (and the reason I only gave this 4 stars):1. Batteries are hard to change, and the battery cover could easily have been designed differently.2. A steeper angle and a shallower angle would have been nice.This saved us from having to try to get a bassinet as well as a baby seat, and meant that baby could sleep wherever we were."
56918,2,"While this gate seems to be sturdy, it did not work for my purposes. I bought it to keep my 26 month old in his room at night time. Well he figured out how to open it in about 5 minutes. It took longer than that to put up and take down"
160919,1,"I ordered this for my husband, but I find myself choosing it over my diaper bag quite often. I love all of the pockets and the inside is very spacious. It's big though, so I had to get something smaller for quick trips."
104713,1,"its a must have w/kids, no matter how careful they are, they always spill the juice boxes. I love that u can use it for boxes and foil packets."
154238,1,We love Seventh Generation wipes and diapers. For the most part we use cloth wipes and diapers during the day and disposables at night. We have tried several other brands but Seventh Generation is the best! We use many of their products in our home.
71620,1,one of the best toy storages i have ever had. Very compact and spacious! I'm going to order at least one more.
151029,0,"I will start with this. The finished product is quite nice for the money. There were some flaws in the finish, but, nothing a little scratch cover can't fix. The directions were very confusing and you had to read ahead 3 steps in order to understand the previous steps. It took me several hours, should have only taken a few hours. I have assembled so many items big and small. This one looks simple, but, it wasn't. Once I got it all together, polished it and added some final touches, it looked pretty nice. Be very careful putting the drawer together, the material breaks easily during this phase of assembly. The pad is very thin, you might want to consider a thicker one."
108296,0,"I needed a pacifier to stay in my sons mouth while sleeping. This was the perfectidea. I had alreayd made 1 myself at homoe, but it was stupid looking. Mine turned out better becuase it was a little bigger and heavier so it spread out across the infants chest to keep the pacifier in place and he held onto it. This one was MUCH better lookig but it was so light it fell out all the time. the legs really needed ot be BEAN BAG FILLED. I have a frog with bean beg legs and made my own. It's a great idea and probably works for most, it just didn't for me."
122761,0,"I bought this to use with my 2 month old to dispense a medicine he needs daily. The idea is great but this product is not really suitable for younger babies with smaller mouths. The part that goes in the mouth is about the same size as a 18-month old's pacifier, so it fills a smaller baby's mouth and it's hard for him to suck on and get the meds. It's also quite stiff, so it's hard to suck on too. The plunger sticks a little so if you try to use it to push the meds through, baby ends up with a mouth full of meds and gags or spits it out. The reservoir for the meds is quite small so if you use a syringe to measure out meds and squirt it into the reservoir it can splash out easily. Also you need to hold the pacifier with one hand when filling it up, so you only have one hand to work with. I'm hoping that as baby gets bigger this will become more useful, although the 5ml capacity is quite small. For now I am using a nipple from a baby bottle (which has a flat cap so it can sit on the counter while I measure meds and fill it up)."
140224,0,"It's been two months since I've used this jogger. I have two kids, ages 2 and 4. I use this jogger for my walks on a trail by my house. These are my likes and dislikes.LIKES -1. Parent tray (two cup holders and closed compartment) is nice. Closed compartment is perfect for cell phone and keys.2. Big baskets underneath the seats are great. Plenty of room for jackets, snacks for the kids, and whatever you want to bring along (like small toys to keep the kids occupied).3. The canopy lowers down more than the usual joggers out there. It's nice because you can adjust the canopy to protect the kids faces from the sun.DISLIKES:1. The cupholders are not very deep so when the jogger goes over some rough bumps water bottles pops right out.2. Front wheel does not swivel so turning is difficult. I think a lot of joggers are made this way for a reason. It was very frustrating at first but now I'm used to it. When I have to turn I just push down on the handle bar little bit to tilt the front wheel up and turn. This jogger not turning very easily doesn't bother me that much because I don't use the jogger around the neighborhood streets very much but use it most of the time on a straight trail.Overall, it's a good jogger. It's easy to push even on a incline. I've read reviews and heard from friends about the tires going flat easily but I haven't had that problem yet.I don't know how easy it is to fold this jogger and how compact it is because I haven't tried that yet. But just by looking at it, I think I can get it in the back of my minivan without having to fold it up. This jogger is actually lighter than my Peg Perego double stroller.My kids are small for their age so their shoulders overlapping hasn't been a problem. But the seats are pretty narrow and I think by next summer I'll be having that problem.If you're going to be walking or jogging around your neighborhood streets, I don't recommend this jogger or any jogger with a steady front wheel."
172472,2,"The swivel seat is very hard to turn, and the seat can pinch little bottoms the way it pushes up and down. I have a very difficult time reaching all her body parts the way the seat is designed. I finally had to just ask my husband to hold her up while I did the washing. I had higher hopes since there really are not many bath seats to choose from. It is already in the attic after only being used a couple of weeks."
40342,1,We have used the Pampers from Day one and had only one or two blow outs this is important when you are dealing with two. Plus we subscribe to them on Amazon so they are cheaper than the store brands.
44362,1,"I ordered this bedding set as the bundle, with the hamper and crib dust ruffle. It is so beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice! Ordering the bundle is alot cheaper than going to Target or Babys-r-us and buying their 3 piece sets, or buying everything seperate. The hamper is small, so if you are looking for a large sized hamper I do recommend a different one. But the hamper does have mesh liner and the fabric comes off the wood easily so you can wash it. The quilt fabric is very durable and the size of the quilt is rather large. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light, delicate, almost victorian bedding ensemble for their baby."
49939,1,"It is a really nice stroller, but difficult to collapse and reopen. The basket does not hold enough and I am actually having the manufacturer look at the mechanism because it does not stay open and latched on one side. But it is a very comfortable stroller for my daughter. She has been in it since she was born. She is 8 months old now. I hope it is fixable!"
34677,2,"I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago. A week ago it just stopped working. I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore. So I went out and bought the exact same steamer. I used it for 2 days and then on the third day, yesterday, it wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm taking it back today and getting something else."
111186,1,"I bought this cover for my second son. With my first I would use a blanket or towel to cover me. You would think it would work fine but it doesn't. I really like this cover. It covers you completely but the baby doesn't feel stifled. The bow at the top allows you to look down and see the baby and see what you're doing. I really like the covers print, style and I use it quite often so I don't feel exposed."
3528,1,"I'd been decorating my daughter's ""big girl room"" in bits and pieces, starting with a polka dot comforter that I loved. I had simple white valances up, but the room just wasn't coming together. When I spotted these online, they seemed perfect, but you never really know until you see them in person. Thankfully, they didn't disappoint! They are a nice weight, well made, and are full enough that I only needed one valance per window. Plus the colors really pull everything together. I would definitely order them again!"
137855,0,"If you are looking for something that has three buttons and simply projects light through the cut outs of stars on its back in three different colors, that is what this is. Maybe other people expected this, so they weren't disappointed, but I had expected more based upon the description and all of the positive feedback.I felt that although this is definitely cute if you are just looking for a neat nightlight for your kids, it is pretty cheaply made and isn't as exciting as described. I was also under the impression that it made sounds and told a story, but there is simply a little booklet included with the ladybug. It isn't necessarily the manufacturers fault that I misunderstood the description, but I thought I would clarify this for others.Summary:This has a cheap plastic ""ladybug"" shell and three buttons that project light through the cutout starts on the ladybugs' back. Don't expect any more than this."
149667,1,Loved the high chair for our granddaughters' baby doll. Hardware was missing with shipment but sent to us within one week. Our granddaughter loves it!
174565,1,"The baskets are very cute and practical, however, they are a tad bit flimsy. Babies 'R Us sells some that are MUCH sturdier and I would recommend those over these. However, for $9.99, still a pretty good deal and a nice way to store baby's diapers, toys, etc."
184202,1,"Came fast in the mail. Love it! Would recommend to others. Happy customers! Love Peanuts, fits nursery perfect. Five stars from me!"
31082,0,"I must have the exceptional children. This is a great stroller but my youngest is 20 months and the front seat is too shallow for him, he's a tall guy. His legs dangel out almost touching the ground. The foot shelf is too narrow for him to use. My older son is almost 5 and he loves to sit or stand, but sitting his head touches the canopy, so he has to duck down. When they are both in it, it does strain to one side, especially if the sidewalk is a little slanted, as most are.I use it every day for the school run. It is perfect for that but I don't use it any longer than that."
113227,1,I absolutely love this diaper bag not to mention I get so many compliments on the bag. I love that it comes with a changing pad and bottle holder. The bag itself is very spacious holds eberyhing I need. This bag is not for someone who is look for a small quick and easy bag. Overalll I loves it
94064,0,"The baskets are cute and the liners you purchase seperately do fit and look nice. But, the baskets themselves are really cheap. They flake off large pieces and the edges are so sharp, they will stab you. You can't set them on nice furniture, or it will scratch the furniture to death. I would spend just a bit more and get nicer baskets."
109138,1,"This is a great addition to the bumbo chair. My son could not reach toys while sitting in it. This fits the chair perfectly, and I can stick the little suction cup baby toys to it and he plays for a long time. His sitting up skills have improved alot. He can sit up on the ground by himself now, but he still likes to sit in the chair when he eats."
180294,1,"I like that all the parts to this pump come apart. It's convenient for nursing mothers and easy to transport. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty efficient too."
134855,1,"When I saw the instruction manual that came with this car seat, I got a little nervous: it was so thick I set aside an entire afternoon to figure out how to install it. But when I actually started the installation, I was done in five minutes. The car seat seems to be perfectly comfortable for my son, and I've never had any problem with the red release handle when removing it from the base. The catches to move the carrying handle are a little funky: you need to be using equal pressure on both, or else they do stick. Not a big problem. I certainly don't want the handle moving about so easily that it isn't secure. And I love the little release button between his knees that allows me to loosen the shoulder straps before or after buckling them for easier maneuvering. I have recommended this car seat to several pregnant friends and will be looking to purchase another Graco seat when I buy him a convertible seat."
174153,2,"My baby loves, loves, loves this swing. We love it because it swings two ways. If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way.Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out... Twice! We purchased the first swing in December 06. In February the motor went out and we had to get another one. Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN!We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him. All he ever does is swing. I don't think we got a lemon.... TWICE! I think it's a flaw in the motor.Someone talked about this item not being sturdy. It doesn't feel sturdy but it is. It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing. We've never had any problems with it breaking down. We only have motor issues.At $159 the motor should not go out. I'd stay away from it.If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that. That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it."
166896,0,"My friend had several of the fleece sacks for her son (3 months older than my son) and I always felt they were VERY scratchy both inside and out and did not seem to wear very well through multiple washings. We borrowed one for a nap at her house and my son woke up sweaty wet because the fleece was just not breathable enough. Since he was just transitioning from being swaddled to needing a sack, I bought the velboa one instead and I feel it has been much better, but it still has some flaws.Pros:-Seems to be more breathable than fleece-outside is still super soft after many months of washing/wearing-doesn't seem as cheapCons:-inside is pilled up just like the fleece one (reason for 3 stars out of 5)I wish that Halo Innovations would come out with some other fabric options (cotton sweater knit, quilted flannel, nicer fleece) and better color choices because they have a good product, it's just not GREAT!"
73221,1,"We have had this bottle for about 6 months, and I do like it. The cap and straw mechanisms are great. The straw is of high quality and is easy to clean. The cap closes tightly and opens easily.I would recommend it. The only problem is that on one of its many drops, the bottom pink plastic broke. It is glued to the bottom of the bottle itself (plastic-to-metal), so the break just caused a crack on the side ""wall"", and made a protruding pointy piece that was sharp and hard. Not good. I had to struggle with pliers to rip out the plastic and scrape off the glue in order to make it useful again.The plastic should be more resistant to the inevitable drops.Another minor issue is that it is of substantial weight. It feels ""solid"".I would recommend it because it is a superior product, save for the bottom plastic breaking."
9557,1,"I can't say enough good about this potty chair. It's inexpensive (but very well made), SUPER easy to clean, has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable (I'm assuming). I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool. Don't like it at all. Tough to clean (lots of spaces for urine to get) and I don't think it's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it. Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed. Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st. Great product. Can't say enough good about it.From a parent's stand point, it's the best b/c it's soooo easy to clean. I'm not clean freak, but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product."
52684,2,"My baby did not like this, you are not able to bounce this manually . All it does is vibrate and that is not enough sometimes for the newborn who enjoys bouncing movements."
128539,1,"Threw out ALL my plastic evenflo and gerber bottles and purchased these! They work great. For anyone afraid of giving glass bottles to the babies, no worries. My little darlin has dropped these on my tile floor in the master bathroom and they didn't even come near breaking. I've also caught her clanging 2 bottles together!! They are a bit heavier than the plastic, but she adjusted just fine after a few uses. Helping her build up her biceps :) Oh and after finding a bottle that had been ""lost"" for a few days, the ""cottage cheese"" mixture that had formed inside washed right out with warm water and then was put in the dishwasher. The plastic bottles would always hold onto all that gunk and inevitably end up in the trash."
175591,0,"The Halo 2N1 itself wasn't enough to keep our baby's hands tightly swaddled. Also, the sleepsack itself tends to bunch up around the neck. While the fleece keeps baby warm, it does pill after several washings. We only use the removeable swaddle band to help swaddle w/a traditional blanket."
91234,1,"The big plus on this is the dual monitors so I can keep one upstairs and one downstairs without having to worry about unplugging it to move it.The reception on this is great! I could even hear my baby moving and breathing! I had some problems with the humming/static at first, but found that fiddling with the channels and the location of the receiver fixed that problem. Great product! I highly recommend it!"
146037,1,Length:: 0:50 MinsThis is my 7 month old son Ethan. I think the video will speak for itself!
81959,0,"When I first got the Pillow it was just okay. I was only about 20 weeks along and about 126 lbs. It was too big for me at that time to use it all together, and was causing my hips to be sore every morning. So I took off the two big end pieces and slept with just the middle part for my belly which was perfect! The only thing annoying thing about that is that the middle part of the pillow does not come out of the given pillow case, so you have these two huge flaps of fabric in the way. But the pillow was still worth it to me. It's the perfect size and shape to fit under/around my belly. I am now 26 weeks along and have gotten big enough to want something between my legs, so I put one end back in and it's perfect. Forms to my legs and hips perfectly. I don't put in the other big end piece because it was just too big and it made my neck sore. When I was trying to sleep with the entire pillow put together when I first received it, like I said, my neck and hips were sore, but the seam on The pillow case also hurt my neck, it was really tight and would leave a huge indent on my neck/shoulder, so that was annoying. I gave it a 4-star though bc it really is comfortable now that I am big enough for it. It is a little large but my husband and I have been sleeping on a futon at my parents house the last few weeks and we still fit. It's definitely crowded, but we both don't move much at night, so it's not a big deal to us. And he can still cuddle up to me which he was worried about at first. So here is summary of pros and cons:Pros:-many different positions you can use this thing in-can use one or all parts of the pillow in multiple ways-middle section cradles my big belly perfectly-relatively easy to roll over with (have to pull to sheets back, but I don't have to get up)-shapes my legs and hips really well, don't wake up with sore hipsCons:-seam on the end pieces in the middle are really uncomfortable (although only bothers my neck, not my legs)- pillow case is weird, the middle section of the pillow does not come out of the case so if you take out the two end pieces you have two huge flaps of extra fabric to try and deal with)-not sure how to wash the pillow case if the middle section of the pillow doesn't come out, so that's kind of gross.Update 9/14/11-I am now 37 weeks pregnant and sleep with this pillow every night still. BUT the pillow has become so flat between my knees that I had to add a body pillow to elevate my leg enough to prevent nerves from pinching. I still LOVE the middle part of the pillow b/c of how perfectly it cradles my belly, but honestly, the material the pillow stuffing is made of is just of really poor quality. You would expect a pillow that cost this much to hold up more than this one has. So unless you want to be adding pillows to this one after only a few months of use, then look for another pillow."
64688,0,"First, in this set there are two teethers (fish and butterfly) and three rattles (phone, rings, and clown face). The ""clown face"" got a mirror at back.""Fish"" is made of cloth. If you are an experienced mom, you'd know how bad this is. It is quickly soaked with your baby's saliva. Whether to wash it or not, it's hardly ever dry!""Butterfly"" (teether) and ""clown face"" (rattle) are too heavy for a 3/4 months old. ""Rings"" (rattle) is light, but the big ring is big - even now my daughter (who is 6 months old) can put her arm through it. My daughter has been a big girl - her weight and height were both above 75% every time we went for the well check.I was excited about the ""clown face"" since it has a mirror. However, I ended up not using it even once, because I washed it. The soap water (I used soap) got into the surrounding hollow tubes. It goes in, it can come out. I don't want my baby lick soap.To wrap up, we end up using three pieces only, namely ""butterfly"" (heavy for a small baby), ""rings"" (big for a small baby), and ""phone""."
121281,1,From my wife:This is the fourth diaper bag I've bought and it is the best by far. There are plenty of pockets where you need them and they are easily accessible with one hand. I love that I can have two hands free and it stays upright when I put it down. The bag is cute and the fabric is durable. It's a fantastic bag!
16147,1,I'm pleased with the quality of this blanket (except one area where it looks like it slipped on the sewing machine and pulled the fabric into a near-by seam). It's a good size for two adults or one adult and two kids. And it packs up into it's own carring case very easily.
16693,0,"These cups are very nice but they require the little ones to bite the straw to allow liquid through. My daughter is used to normal, non-squeeze straws, so this was pretty frustrating for her. Also, there are three parts to the straw, the flexi-top that sticks up, then a little thing, then a long one. So, lots of things to wash and keep out of the garbage disposal! They don't work for us, however, I will say they are very non-spill."
118625,2,"The thermometer is horribly inaccurate. The medicine dispensers come with the medicine, so that's useless. I got 3 bulb syringes and 3 combs from the hospital. Everything else bought separately would be cheaper."
79444,1,"I've tried different brands of diapers and Pampers Swaddlers is the only one that never causes any accident on my very wiggly child. It's very soft and absorbent, and has a pleasant smell. Plus it's white so its color doesn't show through baby's underwear in the summer. Highly recommended. Too bad now my baby's bigger and we had to switch to Cruisers and Baby Dry."
100427,1,"Good as diaper lasts long. Good during travel and keeps dry, no body rashes. Good for boys under 8 months."
121060,0,"We have been using these diapers for about a week and so far we haven't had any leaks. I like that they are very easy to use and wash. The following are what I do not like:1) Bulkiness - I can't get my son's clothes on over the diaper2) The material of the outer part of the diaper - it rubs my son's skin and leaves red marks if he is sitting and his belly rolls over the top of the diaper3) It's difficult to get a good fit around my son's waist4) I'm not sure how long the velcro will last - from other reviews I have seen, many people prefer the snap closures because the velcro doesn't last long"
47995,1,"Both my kids are prone to ear infections and this works great to help us detect ear infections. In fact, my doctor uses it as well! It has worked great for us so far, well worth the money."
137477,1,Seriously fantastic. It is like having those glow in the dark stars on your ceiling but removable. Provides a soft glow of night sky on the ceiling; just enough of a night light for our toddler (and for us if we need to go in there) & it looks plain cool. I am just so happy with this purchase!
45667,1,The product is great. My baby adopted to it instantly and hasn't stop playing with it since Xmas. Thanks and Happy Holidays.
12188,1,"I purchased this pump when I was returning to work 2 months ago, but wanted to continue breastfeeding. I initially tried using the Evenflo pump leftover from my oldest daughter (I only pumped infrequently with her), but using a single sided pump wasn't effectively expressing enough milk.I am very pleased with the performance of this pump. I didn't want to invest the [money] one of the Medela pumps costs, since I wouldn't need to use it again after my baby weaned (she is the last baby), this pump was the perfect alternative.The variable suction control is great, I use it stronger at first to get ""let-down"" started and then turn it down once the milk has started flowing. The suction release is also a nice feature, making it easy to simulate baby's sucking action.The pump is very easy to assemble and disassemble and very easy to clean. The motor is a little loud, but not so noisy that anyone outside of my office can hear it with the door shut. With the double sided pump, I am able to express MORE than enough milk for my baby to drink the next day.The only thing to improve would be the carrying bag, which really needs a separate compartment for storing the milk and freezer pack.This is a very economic but efficient pump, well worth the money."
112923,1,"Ever since my son was born, we have tried our very best to avoid all chemicals that came in contact with him. Well, one of the most important were baby wipes. I wanted a baby wipe that scored low on the Environmental Working Group website [...] And I also didn't want to spend lots of money to do so. Well, these wipes solved our problem. They do not smell, and are always pretty wet. Just an FYI, if you are having problems with the moisture, just cut a small hole in the plastic bag on the top, and put the whole thing into you wipes container rather than pulling out all the wipes. They stay wetter longer. And also, they are a pain to pull out one handed which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. But, what we do is if my son has a poopy, I pull out about 4-5 wipes ahead of time, so I don't have to fiddle with it. Poof! Problem solved. I would rather have a safer wipe than a more convenient one. Highly recommend!"
24349,1,we had been looking for a upstairs child proof gate for a long time. this gate works perfectly. my 3 and half and 2 and a half year olds have not been able to conquer this gate. i rest easy knowing that this gate is sturdy and prevents my kids from trying to access the stairs. the installation was easy. the only issue i had was the little plastic wrench that was included. they should have a better wrench. just as a tip i used zip ties to hold the gate and provide that extra sturdiness and support which thus far has worked!
106986,0,"I agree with all of those who said this product is easy to use, it is. It is also very good at keeping little hands out of the dirty diapers.What I have found though is that when a stinky diaper is deposited, the room smells until I change the bag out. One thing that I have done is when I am going to deposit a poopy diaper is to place an empty plastic bag into the tube area, put the diaper in it, and then tie that bag off before turning the champ handle, thus adding another layer of stink prevention. It isn't perfect, but it helps. I like the idea of trying scented garbage bags, so may give that a whirl too.I wanted to write a review so that people don't buy this and think that it solves ALL of their diaper problems. I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck."
25288,1,I love these because we always have little feet on the back of our seats. This keeps some of the dirt off the seat and it has a little pocket to keep the wireless headphones in for the TV.
6271,1,I can't believe alot of the reviews I've read regarding this monitor. We have been using it for eight months and have never had a problem! The picture is perfectly clear as well as the sound. This monitor has been worth every penny - If something does happen to go wrong with it - I would spend the money again to get another one.
6657,1,Only diapers that stay on her as she is a little daredevil.Climbing and jumping..she is very small in butt size and these will actually adjust to what she needs yet have give room.
97411,1,"I purchased this mat to place under some of sons bigger toys, like his small slide, that he sometimes slips off of for extra protection. It folds up quite easily and isn't too hard to store. Very durable but soft enough for a little downtime after running around."
84190,2,I purchased the Baby Bjorn which worked really well for us until our baby was about 15 pounds then she became too heavy so I purchased the Hip Hammock since it is for bigger babies. The first couple of times I used it I liked it but then I started getting a pinched nerve in my neck area. I am only 5 feet tall so I had to adjust the straps all the way and my baby is pretty big. I finally returned it to the store since it wasn't cheap and we couldn't use it anymore.
123124,1,"This is a very handy and attractive product to use when you need to put baby somewhere safe while you are doing something other than holding the baby. It's easy to set up and to fold up for storage. It's colorful and interesting for the baby, too."
125387,0,My 6 month old is not crazy about this teether. It is rather large. She will chew on it a minute and put it down.
155815,2,"I was disappointed when I received my LumiSource floor lamp. It only had five sconces when the picture showed six. One sconce was broken in shipping. Additionally, the quality was not as good as my friends, which may indicate that LumiSource has lowered thier quality."
12321,2,"Why spend the money? Only neccessary if you are feeding over carpet. Vinyl floor wipes well. Go to the dollar store and spen a buck on a large vinyl tablecloth or shower curtain. Chose your color, size, style, etc. and only spend a buck. These are usually much bigger than the splat mats and work just as well. Can match your tablecloth or home decor if you wish. Just eye candy in the store, you really do not need everything they sell. Save the cash for important items."
37748,2,"I just tried these wipes bc of the good price, but not worth it. They're very flimsy and thin and I get poo on my hands easily. I wound up using twice as many which defeated the purpose of more wipes for the $$$$$"
36792,1,"I'm really glad I got this! It is nice for feeding but works great for just holding baby in a better position. I read a review knocking it for not being waterproof or having waterproof covers to keep liquids off of it. After my own use, yes that would be nice but the pillow washes great! I just tossed it in the washer on delicate with the baby clothes, dried it in the dryer and it was good as new! My only complaint is that the ends are already (after10 weeks) starting to compress."
180314,1,"Got this breastpump, manual one after trying to use the one from the hospital. It's quite easy and convenient to use. Suction pump works very well, not like the electronic one. It comes with lower price tags that is healthier for the pockets too. Recommended both by price, ease of use and effectiveness."
25436,0,"I think these work great if you have the correct cabinets. the cabintes i have, have drawers on the top of them so the sticker does not have a flat surface to stick to, it only has a little lip and its not enough surface area for the sticker to attach to.i was disappointed when my 11 month old was able to pull the sticker off and pull open the door. =("
991,1,We have tried every brand of diapers and we always come back to Pampers since they are the only ones which have the best fit and does not leak ever!
63819,0,"When you fully recline the seat, the back folds to a 90 degree angle and it makes the bed too short. At the bottom end of the seat there is a edge that folds down and does nothing. It only folds down our straight up....straight up stops your babies feet from hanging down. My baby is only 28"" and can't fully recline. Please let me know if I am doing something wrong!Maneuverability good for one handed pushing.Removable tray is good for snacks, but not deep enough to hold an average size sippy cup. Upper cup holder not deep enough, but nice lidded compartment comes in handy for keys, or small phone for quick access.Ample storage, good balance with a full diaper bag hanging on back (even without baby in it)Wish it was lighter, on heavy side.Folds easily once you get the hang of it, great stand up feature when folded, and folded locking mechanism handy.Great with infant seat, clicks in and one hand trigger release, but you have to use with snack tray in place.Took this on a airplane trip alone and it did very well to hold lots of stuff in it. Just a bit difficult because it is a bit heavy and bulky."
174845,2,I got these in a baby 1st aid kit. Don't know if mine was just a defect but i could'nt get it to trim my 1 month's nails at all. It would just crimp the nail and then I would have to tear it off. I thought maybe it was because his nails are soft so I tried it on my nails and it did the same. I just threw them away. I wouldn't reccomend them. Although they were very confortable in my hands and I felt total control over the clippers. But still no good at trimming the nail.
63566,1,"I really liked this mirror, I can see my baby from the rearview mirror and although the view is a bit fuzzy because of the type of mirror, I can look good enough all her movements. Also, it looks very cute."
125666,1,"The first safety gate I bought for the top of our stairs did not do the job. I did not have a stud opposite the banister and the gate had a bar across the bottom which had to be stepped over everytime you went through. Very unsafe! All it took was one person to put their weight on the cross bar and suddenly there were giant holes in my drywall.I was looking for a top-of-stairs gate that could be mounted at an angle so I could drill into the nearest stud, and did not have a crossbar along the bottom. This KidCo gate fit the bill exactly! As a bonus, it even looks nice with the rest of the wood decor in my house. There are a few things worth pointing out:1) The directions are not impossible, but take some time to read through them before starting. I agree with other reviewers, label all pieces.2) Tools I needed included power drill, drill bit set, screwdrivers.3) Drilling into the banister was not ideal, so I also purchased the KidCo gate installation kit. Also, on the opposite wall where the stud was, the baseboard was going to interfere with the mounting of the gate hinge. To give myself a level, vertical surface to mount the hinges on, I secured a wood strip like the one that came with the gate installation kit to the wall. The wood strip had a smaller wood block (same width as the baseboard) behind it at the top to act as a spacer.4) While not specified in the gate directions, I did need to drill pilot holes into my wood strips. I expect this might also be true if you were mounting on a banister or into a stud.It took a long time to finish the whole project. But once you start working through the instructions, the mounting is fairly straight-forward. I am very pleased with the final product. It is sturdy, and nice-looking, and much safer than my previous gate. I only gave it four stars because I thought the instructions could have been a little better."
133406,0,"We bought 18 bottle sets for our newborn twins. We are down to 10 collars and we can't find replacement ones without spending a mint on replacing the entire set. They don't respond to e-mails. If we don't tighten the caps down, they leak. If we over tighten, they break. I would not recommend this product."
8959,1,"We used these when our son was littler, and now I'm buying them for a friend. They making eating out much more manageable by providing a clean surface from which baby can eat. My only complaint is that the sticky-tape that holds the mat down is only on the top and bottom--which means that baby can grab the sides and rip the mat off of the table. If I were the manufacturer, I'd improve the product by putting the sticky-tape on all four sides. Regardless, this is still a great product and I wish I'd thought of it first."
158292,1,Excellent price - quality product. Easy to use and move from one room to another AND it does not take up a lot of space.
87357,0,"I originally bought the four ounce versions, and quikly found out that pushing the liner up was difficult after a burbing. When my baby started taking more than 4 oz, I switched to the Easy Feeder bottles, also from Playtex. These have a a slider that pushes the air out and is pretty easy to use. I tried all the nipples, but found the silicon ones the best for my baby. You can also buy store brand liners at a much reduced priced. I have found these to be just as good as the Playtex ones. In short I love the disposable ystemut would recommend the Easy Feeder bottles. As for traveling with your bottles, use a cooler a bag and an ice pack."
182064,1,Good size tub. Smells nice. Heavy cream stays on the skin without getting easily rubbed off onto diaper. Starts working on skin after one application. You can see the improvement. Never seen a softer baby's butt.
149870,1,"I've decided that if I never use this item again it was well worth the money. My boys are a little older I think than the average user at 4 & 6 almost 5& 7 and they loved having everything at their fingertips. Both Boys being into cars it made a very good highway and racetrack. Coloring was great , crayons stayed in the tray and easy to get when in one of the four pockets. We did not have the number of dropped, crayons, cars, foods as we did in previous trips which makes it that much more enjoyable for mom. It is very easy to adjust and install . Just put strap around the back of a child strapped into their car-seat. They are soft and flexible so they had no problems falling asleep with this on their laps in fact it was great at holding the additional stuffed animals they just had to have. In all was well worth the money, for snack or play it definitely met all of my expectations."
171295,1,"My first review EVER on any website but figure what site to better start my review process than Amazon itself.First, I received this as part of my registry and Amazon had sent the wrong version of the tub. Despite the error, Amazon customer service was outstanding. Not only did the rep corrected the mistake and got everything processed in a matter of minutes with free shipping to return the wrong product but the replacement came literally overnight at no cost to me or the gift giver. That's what I call customer service and surely many retailers should learn from Amazon especially if they want to keep their customers happy and loyal.Okay, now to the product... This is one of the most functional and practical item that all new parents should seriously have on their 'must have' lists. The sling certainly comes in handy for newborns as it acts as an extra support for their bodies and prevents them from sliding down. In addition, the storage area is a huge plus - the right amount to put in what you really need or use to bathe your child. To help the drying process, I angle it and put it upside down against the tub sprout, which I find to help a lot if you want to prevent mildew etc after each use.I'm looking forward to using this tub as my baby grows and transitions from newborn to toddler... &lt;(^.^)>"
3892,1,"my baby chews on her bottle nipples/ avent. but this one, no... i wonder... maybe because it's very soft. i would recommend to mothers. i bought this because the bottles came with slow drip."
149191,1,"I agree with other reviewers about the seam being in a really horrible place. I sleep with my head at the bottom of the ""U"" shape and if I am up too high in the pillow, the seam cuts into my shoulder. They really should fix that...that being said, I can't sleep without this pillow! I've been a stomach sleeper my whole life and once my belly was too big for that I was forced into side sleeping, which was not working for me until I got this pillow. I didn't want to fuss with a single sided body pillow every time I flipped from one side to the other. This way I flip over and there is a body pillow already there and ready for me!This thing is huge...takes up my entire side of our queen bed. My husband calls it my escape pod because it's so big I literally have to climb in and out of it. It was also a little too puffy at first, but it has calmed down with use--I've had if for about a month now. If something happened to this pillow, I would buy it again."
105941,0,"We got this diaper pail as a shower gift before my son was born. He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!! It didn't smell at all the first six months but once we started my son on baby food the smell was horrific! I understand that you have to change the bag often but this thing doesn't even contain the smell after one day of dirty diapers!But I guess I still like it more than the Diaper Genie.Bottom line - all diaper pails smell - so do you want one that's easy to use and can use regular bags or do you want one that require expensive refills and isn't as user friendly?"
176595,1,"We used this bottle system for our first child and plan to use it again for our second. The bottles themselves are very durable and certainly will last for 2+ children. The nipples are fairly durable. We replaced all of them after about 6 months. Once teeth start coming in, their lifespan (as with all nipples I suspect) start to decrease.The system comes with at least 3 nipple types, newborn, infant, and the orthodontic. The newborn nipple was simply not providing sufficient flow. We quickly changed to the infant nipple. That worked OK, until will tried the orthodontic. Our daughter sucked the bottles dry with the orthodontic nipple. We replaced all the nipples with the orthodontic nipple and used those until the transition to sippy cups.Playtex offers 2 types of bags for the bottles, the formed bags and the ""traditional"" flat bags. The formed bags are easier to use and determining the amount consumed is more reliable, but they are much more costly. Also, the formed bags don't keep air out as well as the flat ""traditional"" bags. The flat bags can be easily pinched to remove air and they are much less expensive. The flat bags are also offered as store brands (even less expensive than Playtex) from most major pharmacies and grocery stores."
133252,1,"I bought the backpack version of the Medela Pump In Style Advanced to use at home, and this item to keep at work since they have the hospital grade pumps. I've only used them a handful of times and am satisfied. The only downside is the tubing builds condensation. I don't have this problem with my electric pump at home. Other than that I am happy with the purchase."
110715,1,"Thank goodness we had this because I ended up with an emergency c-section and when we got home I was frequently to sore to move, and when my husband had to go back to work sometimes I spent the whole day in bed and I could easily scoop up the baby to play and then put her back to sleep. Our mattress is pillow top so it was really hard to get in and out of the bed. In part because the co-sleeper makes it harder, but still worth it. Though I cursed the pillow top mattress many many times. It' hard to imagine now, but I clearly remember it being hard to move in bed.After a bout with colic we've had to try many different things to get the baby to sleep. Another benefit of the co-sleeper is I can roll over and just put a hand on her, settle her back into sleep without getting up, likewise I give her a bottle by rolling over. Often I soothe her to sleep on a pillow then transition her to the co-sleeper once she's asleep. One thing they don't tell you is everything you do to get the baby to sleep makes you sleepy too. With the co-sleeper I can go to sleep the same time as her without having to get up to go to my bed. Especially is her sleep is tentative. How terrible to have to get up just to stand with a hand on her for 2 minutes.We planned on using this as a pack and play too, it's a little heavy, and obviously take a bit longer to set-up/take down, just things to remember."
126094,1,"Not much to say! After the Amazon Mom discount and the Subscribe and Save discount, no one can beat these diapers for the price!!! Love 'em!"
177422,1,"I tried buying all other kinds of pumps but a friend of mine suggested to get the Avent Manual breast pump. Given the same amount of time, she told me that you can get more milk from the manual pump. The pump is really handy and you can bring it anywhere, anytime. I am very excited to use my pump. It was really worth it."
80013,1,Was looking for a stainless steel water bottle for a 2 and 5 yr. old. Tried kleen kanteen but they are hard to hold and not easy to open and they leak! This seems to work good (just got it). Both kids can open and close - it doesn't leak and I like that fact that you can order replacement parts so the product lasts longer. Big bonus- after waiting for them to get back in stock on amazon - we found them at Target for $15! I gave a four star rating only because the snap top construction seems like it could break easily with a drop - only time will tell though!
11355,2,"We bought this Sounds N Lights Monitor after the previous model of the same name stopped working (that should have been a sign). After only a month, in the middle of the night, it started putting out only loud static. In the morning, we discovered that the plug on the base of the monitor (in the baby's room)was partially melted and had almost caught fire. We will never purchase a Fisher Price monitor again."
82873,1,"This is a great item and always calmed our baby. Unfortunately, when the batteries began to get low it would not stay on long enough to be effective. While this is understandable, it's not convenient when you are trying to calm the crying baby!"
115471,1,I will never buy anything else again. I love the soap and the companies values. They both are AWESOME! Definitely well worth purchasing.
77093,2,"For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got. First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position. Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working. Calls to ""customer service"" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item. While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing."
72695,0,"I ordered this product because I have used it for my first son. I rate it 3 stars because shipping took way too long, more than 2 weeks. On top of that they sent me level 2 package and when I opened it was level 3 nipples. Was not worth replacing, but I did it anyway. Amazon usually ships faster, and when I tried cancelling the order it said I would have to pay extra shipping because it made my free shipping order under 25 dollars. Seriously!!!! I was better off catching the sale at Baby R US, Buy one get one 50% percent off and avoid the wait and wrong item."
103782,1,My son loves this toy and hes 7 1/2mths he is able to push the buttons fine he also pulls up on it its a very good toy the only one he loves!
16275,0,"This item was ordered in early Nov. It did not arrive until Dec. 5.The postage due was $21.95. I did not expect to have an extra postage charge, esp. such a large one"
33416,1,"I've read reviews about people saying that the ""memory"" feature isn't working, or that pushing down on the plastic undoes the metal from the memory notches.If you have the metal secured in the notch and you press down and and the metal pops up, it's more likely that you have your gate set up too tightly, so the metal is popping out from stress on the gate. Of course, it could be your individual gate. If you don't feel the metal is hard to push into one of those notches, that maybe the gate should be replaced.On my gate it was incredibly difficult to put the metal into the notches, which is why my memory feature works great. I pull up on the plastic, it loosens, and I can remove the gate. The metal bar stays in the notch though, so all I have to do is replace it in the same opening, push down on the plastic, and it tightens up again. Easy enough that I can do it while carrying my son if he is asleep.Like I said in the title, the pressure mount for the bottom of the gate is above our baseboard moulding, which is something I was concerned about. This means that I can use this gate in any opening in my house safely. The only issue I had was that the gate is almost too small for our stairway (and I did not think that it was a large opening to start with). I had to put it on the very last notch for it to fit snugly in the stairway, but I suppose that is the largest opening I would need to use it for."
26324,1,"We took our first trip and the relatives we were visiting made fun of us for buying this bag. They said all we needed was a trash bag then proceeded to tell us stories of how their daughter's seat got ruined, lost the cushion, etc. So, I felt this was necessary and it worked like a charm. It was very easy to throw over my shoulder, while pushing a stroller, carrying a diaper bag, and trailing the luggage behind. It held up very well through 4 flights and doesn't show any signs of wear. It is very roomy and we used that extra space to pack a few more items. I would say the [cost] was well worth it and I am very happy to have bought it."
6016,2,"The set is as cute as it looks in the picture but did not fare the test of time very well. I got it for my daughter, who was not particularly tough on it at all, and it fell apart after about a year. The bumper ties ripped, the sheets got thin from washing, etc."
166787,2,"My son use this diaper these days. It leaks like crazy!!! I have to change his diaper during midnight so often because it leaks so bad. Even I just change his diaper less than two hours ago, my son's outfit get wet again. It is really bad."
141594,1,My son and I love this walker sooooo much! my mother said this is the best toy that i hv ever bought.My son is now 11 months old and he used this before he can actually stand and walk.Basically this is a great music player- long and fun and a good helper to support my son to walk.My lo walk around the house with this now. SO fun!
41911,1,There is no other like Gund. My son loves his lamby which is incredibly soft. He puts the lamb over his pillow at night and sleeps on this luxurious lamb. He loves to rub it as he falls asleep. It is a great comfort item for young children.
68780,2,I have been buying diapers on Amazon for several months and all of a sudden in the last couple weeks they increased the price by THREE DOLLARS! No longer is this the best solution to buy diapers. Go to Target -- They are cheaper there and take the pampers $1 off coupon that is in the paper almost weekly. BOOO on AMAZON for a ridiculous price increase. The grocery store even has a better price than this!
178281,1,"Typically, this is the best price for these bags and they work marvelously! Pumped exclusively for almost a year and never had any troubles with these wonderful bags, and I froze A LOT of milk!"
135476,2,"Both parent units/receivers stopped working within about a week of each other. When we turned the parent units to ""on,"" we would hear sound from the nursery unit/transmitter for a fraction of a second----then nothing but white noise. This white noise/static sounded much like the fan in our nursery...so we didn't even know that the receivers had broken until we heard crying from the nursery (and then realized, ""Wait...we're not hearing that in the monitor at all"").We're very careful with our electronics...and judging by the fact that these both stopped working independently of each other, I know it had nothing to to with the AC adapters, a mix-up on the channel selection, etc.Fortunately had a few days left before Amazon's 30-day return policy ended, so shipped back for a full refund."
112403,1,"Both my girls have always been Pampers babies. I have tried Huggies, but they are just too bulky with the same absorbance. I like the idea of Huggies' diaper shape, slimmer I the middle. I wish Pampers would come up with diapers in that shape, then it would be perfect for my girls."
106587,1,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free. I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out. I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I've broken several nails on it. I've only had it a few weeks (I've been using it for my toddler's diapers until my new baby comes), and I'm hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it's great that it holds more diapers, and it's SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had. I don't need two hands for it!"
134126,2,I was not impressed with this wipe warmer. The wipes are really more like room temperature at best. I can not find replacements in stores for the pad in the bottom of the warmer. The pad dries out in less than a week and I end up wasting about an inch of the wipes because they dry out. I wish I would have saved my money.
130984,2,"The seller of this product is wonderful, but the Maya Wrap is not for me or my little guy. I guess I am just not a fan of ring slings. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews and this is the first baby carrier I decided to buy. My baby boy (4 weeks old when I received the sling) always wants to be held so I was looking forward to being able to hold him all the time and nurse him hands free.First, I am small framed and the sling kept sliding down so the ring was too low. Then when I tried one of the positions my baby either kept hitting his head on the ring or grabbing onto it. The fabric is not soft and comfortable, it is a bit rough, and the sling does not feel comfortable (for me) when on. But most importantly I don't like the fact that with all the positions except the nursing one, my baby would have to have his legs crunched up in the ""frog"" position - he hates his legs being confined like that!I returned it and ended up buying the Moby Wrap which I love - fabric is soft and comfortable, and my baby can have his legs out in almost all the positions. It is also much easier to figure out how to use and to get him in and out of."
58234,1,I can't say enough great things about this product. My baby was born in December and I used the bundle me until the spring. I didn't have to waste time putting a snowsuit on the baby-I just put him in his carseat and zipped up the sides. It kept him very warm and he looked good too! I would recommend this to anyone having a winter baby!
68124,1,Ive been looking for fun and vibrant sheets for my sons crib and im glad to find these. I was worried if they would be an odd size or something and maybe not fit and be too small but they fit great. I have the davinci kalani crib from target and its a larger sized crib so these sheets will fit any crib you should have. The fabric is soft and well made. I love this zig zag pattern it looks so cool and modern!
26581,1,"I fell in love with the look of this product the first time I saw it! My son slept in it next to my bed until he was over 6 months old. I never had and problems with it. I could use the shelf underneath the keep an extra blanket or diapers. One of the best things was during the day I could bring it into the living room for him to sleep out there and put it back next to the bed at night! When he fussed I was right there to see what he needed and didn't have to get out of bed if it wasn't necessary. It was so easy to move; he was safe, and comfortable in his little bed."
31404,1,"We've been using this rack for over 6 months now and it's been great. We use it to dry everything from baby bottles and mesh feeder parts to the baby's feeding spoons, breast pump parts, and bits and pieces from our various water bottles and sippy cups. Sturdy, lots of places to hang/rest items, very compact footprint on the counter."
44788,0,"Most airlines I am familiar with, will NOT allow you to use a folding car seat during takeoff and landing, regardless if the seat is FAA approved. Has anyone had this experience?"
158274,1,"We've only gotten this out once. But loved it. It didn't stick to the toilet super bad, but stayed in place. I didn't push very hard at all on the sticky tabs. After my child used it I ripped it off, and then realized I should have used it too. I have only used it in the worst bathrooms, like at a park. It helped make the nasty metal toilets not as scary for my daughter to sit on. So far, I love it. Totally worth the money."
50835,1,"Imagine my surprise when the easy sleep of first trimester ended and uncomfortable tossing and turning of second trimester began. I tried a wedge pillow and another polyfill pillow and I wasn't able to get comfortable. I was skeptical of the Snoogle but after a night of amazing sleep with it, my skepticism melted away (along with my chest congestion).Don't wait, get the snoogle and sleep better immediately!"
126678,1,"I bought this because of good price and also my son had no leak problem with huggies. However, I think it is too thick and the quality is not so good, some area of diaper sticks together. I guess it is not as good as getting in the store."
119816,1,"I like the attachements (tray, toy & mats). It helps hold up my 4 month old to where she isn't wobbely and can sit more steadily. She enjoys sitting on the table when eating becuase she is at eye level with the family. I use it mostly to feed her. I do not leave her unattended...she can topple over."
61636,1,"I received this monitor as a gift 2 1/2 years ago and it is still working like I just got it yesterday. The sound is completely clear, easy to use and very durable. I saw some reviews that there is static and high pitch sound - it's probably because you have the volume up too high. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
179902,1,"I've tried many different swaddlers with two kids. This was by far my favorite. My only complaint is that the end piece that you tuck in does come undone at times. Takes a few times to master the swaddle, but it is more secure than others."
137999,1,"We purchased this for my 4 year old daughter, and she just loves it. You can hardly see the yellow stars, even when her room is pitch black. However, the green and the blue stars are awesome! The stars and the moon are extremely crisp, even when the turtle is placed on the floor. We will definitely be purchasing another turtle for my son's room once he's around 1 year old =)"
108303,1,My so loves to take his bottles and shake the crap out of them and formula gets every where. With these nipples everything is dry!! He took to them really well too.
178885,0,"My husband and I bought this stroller because as our son got older we found that our travel system was to heavy and bulky to carry around. We wanted a nice umbrella stroller for everyday use. At first we were happy with this stroller. It is compact, lightweight, and easy to maneuver. My problem was with the straps. I made them as tight as possible and my son could wiggle around quite a bit. This didn't bother me at first (when my son was younger and not as mobile) but then I realized that he was sticking his arms through the straps and trying to get himself out of the stroller. The straps could not be tightened any more than they already were and I was worried that he was going to try and get out of the stroller it flip it over. This is an okay stroller but from a safety standpoint I was concerned. In the end, we retuned it and bought the Peg Perego Aria."
153530,1,Great bag and easily cleaned up after spills. This is my third bag in 5 months! I would recommend this bag to anyone!
162897,1,We bought this seat because it was made by Britax for a much lower price. It was super easy to install. The seat is nice and comfy. My son loves it.
9275,1,This potty is perfect. Has the right size for a toddler (my son is an average size boy for his age- 16 months) and it is easy to clean and use. My son used it immediately after getting it and was not afraid of sitting on it. I'm very happy with this purchase and will totally recommend it to anyone.
67048,1,This is a great stroller! I use it almost every day and it fits through all doorways so far. Very easy to maneuver and folds pretty small.
70354,2,"Because that is what it deserves!!!My husband has put together many items (crib, dresser, armoire, etc.) and it took him over two hours to put this together. Once it was done, he told me not to really use it until he put some tie wraps around where the two pieces meet. OK, that's not a good sign. I tried to pull up the lever, couldn't do it with one had and definately not with my left so I tried it with two hands. It was hard and very painful but I did it.Now, the fact that I can't carry my baby up the stairs and open the gate is a huge problem. My husband said that there is no way to use the gate in that fashion and that I can only use the gate if I'm already upstairs and I wanted to keep our daughter safe. Upon reading all the other reviews, it worries me that she may fall down the stairs.I'm sure that my husband did not read the directions incorrectly as he is not missing parts. He did complain about the diffulty in understanding them though.We're taking it back. I feel terrible after my husband spent so much time on it but the safety is first, easy of use is second and usability is third.Heed our warnings - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! 40+ of us can't all be wrong about this product."
150642,2,"I purchased the Storkcraft furnature for my daugher's room, after over a year of use I am really disappointed in this furnature. The finsh scratches really easily, the drawer gliders are coming apart, this is just very cheaply made. I wish I would have purchased something else."
90088,1,I've tried several different brands of diapers over the last year and let me tell you that hands down Pampers brand is the best. When my son would sleep with Huggies overnight (meaning at best four hours straight) the bed would be wet in the morning. This never happens with Pampers. Their diapers are so absorbent......I love it!
35998,0,"It is comfortable and once you get used to putting it on it is easy. With one kid it's ok, but with 2 it takes too long to get on and it gets twisted when you take baby out and then to put baby back in you have to straighten out the sling it gets bunched up. The cotton material stretches out so i have to redo it a couple of times a day and that is a pain. I got another carrier at Kangarookorner.com The adjustable fleece pouch is the best. It takes all of five seconds to put on and put baby in. Totally worth the money. Kangaroo Korner has the only pouch/sling I will ever buy again and I have tried all of them."
153545,1,"This chair is fantastic for my 8 year old special needs (autistic) son. He has limited motor involvement but we require the stroller for many outings in order to manage behavioral difficulties.This stroller works for what we intended, outings like the grocery store and the park. Its size is perfect for us as we don't own a large vehicle. It folds compactly and fits nicely into the trunk of our car while leaving room for groceries etc. Also, it sets up and comes down easily not as easy as my one handed operation baby stroller did but still simple enough. It is light and easy to handle both when pushing and when lifting it. The swiveling front wheels make the stroller quite maneuverable in the tight spaces.Now for the not so good. The wheels squeak!!! Really loudly. I've had comments from passersby on how loud it was. We applied a silicon lubricant and that removed the squeak but we need to reapply the lubricant regularly or the squeak comes back. The wheels work well for hard surfaces but not so well on softer dirt paths. The frame is square metal instead of the tubular metal that is usually found in strollers. Which means there are many corners and sharp places. The foot rest must be removed to fold the stroller meaning there is an extra piece to set up, store, and get lost... The seat depth is a little too shallow. This reduces the wheel base making the stroller smaller but it doesn't look like he is comfortable perched on it. Overall I think more attention should have been paid to the child's comfort and some effort could have been made to improve it's aesthetics. (It has a very institutional feel)It does convey him from place to place. It does fit in our trunk so I would buy this product again as it is the only one I have been able to find in it's size and style."
174552,1,"I went for the deluxe model because I thought $5 more for extra stuff, why not? It turned out to be a good call. The extra toys plus the two sides on the four hard toys give a lot of variation for the baby. The plastic toys are a little difficult to snap in and out (the stuffed ones just slide in with a knotted fabric piece), but I was able to put the entire thing together in about five minutes with no help. The arms turn at a nice steady pace and stop about a third of the way around for a second before continuing on. I thought that the stuffed toys looked kind of scary with their really big eyes, but the baby loves it and grabs at the toys whenever she is lifted anywhere near the mobile. The arm of the mobile only lets the toys turn when it is pushed all the way into the base, but this doesn't have to be 90 degrees to the crib, it will also run at either 45 degree angle, which gives better control of where it is mounted and keeps it out of the way for picking up the baby without having to swing it around all the time. Music is good and the volume can be adjusted across a reasonable level; I don't use the white noise setting which really just sounds like static to me. The remote is handy if your crib is line-of-sight to the door and study enough that the baby can't hurt it. We didn't hang it on the doorknob because it swings and thunks alerting the baby to your presence, which defeats the purpose. Now that my daughter is 8 months, the mobile is down and I left the music box, but I rarely use it (although she accidently turns it on herself sometimes). All eight toys went into her toy box and she plays with them a lot. the hard toys all have rattly beads in them and the stuffed toys have two with little rattlers and two with squeakers. The only thing I can find wrong with this product is now that I took it down, I have an awkward plastic object to store because you can't take the toy arms back out. That will probably be the case with all mobiles."
67919,1,My daughter LOVES this toy. I was surprised to see so many bad reviews. My daughter actually likes it more than a $40.00 one she was given from a more expensive store.
99937,1,"These tend to run bigger than the Cruisers so if you're not ready to move up to the next size they help. I've had a few leakage issues though but that wouldn't deter me from giving this five stars. They move well too, when they get wet they don't become overly bulky"
174980,0,"I got this for my 8 month old baby - she outgrewThe First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue, and is still too small for the big tubPros:So easy to inflate maybe 2-3 minutes and it was readyI like the suction cup to hang it- although it usually falls down at some point, at least it stays up long enough to dryI can use this on my kitchen counter top or in the bath tubComes with repair patches- which im not sure if this is a pro or con- are they anticipating leaks??Really cuteEasy to travel withCons:For some reason the one I got doesn't 'quack' I was kind of bummed even though it really doesn't matter (still debating if I should exchange it)The cover has to be closed just right you have to check it thoroughly otherwise water will leak out I found this out the hard wayOverall, its a great price for something my baby will only be using for a short while, and I'm happy with it so far."
184706,1,Nice gate. Fits a variety of entrances and doorways. Easy to operate and tall enough for our English Mastiffs. Would recommend.
148565,0,"When I received this pillow, I was super excited to try it out. The pillow is super comfortable. The only complaint I have is that I've only been using the pillow for about a month and it's already starting to get a little flat. This bums me out because I was hoping it would last me the entire pregnancy, but I'm afraid I might have to get a different one to make it through until my due date."
29002,1,"We switched to this nipple after using various other brands that don't have the plastic bag insert, but the our little one was not happy after eating usually.Switching to this seems to make a big difference (along with other changes). It is a much larger nipple than most other brands and it seems to be more natural.We moved from this at about 2.5 months to a medium (Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Medium Flow - 2 Pack) quickly followed by the Tri-Cut (Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Variable Flow Y-Cut - 2 Pack)."
113778,0,"I took my 13 month old to BabiesRus to see if he liked this booster. They were nice enough to take one out of the box so that he could actually sit in it in the store. Good thing they did. At his one year doctor's appointment he weighed almost 24 lbs and was almost 32 inches long. He took up most of this chair. The clerk and I both agreed that in a couple of months he would outgrow this thing. Too bad. It is probably very nice, as so many of the reviews state, but if you child tends to be big, you might want to try before you buy just to make sure you can use this seat for a while. We went with another booster in the store and so far we are very pleased."
92807,1,My daughter absolutely hated tummy time until we got this spinner. We bought it used from a woman in a mommy group. My daughter is such an explorer that she really enjoyed playing with all the gadgets on the mat. I highly recommend.
176404,0,"i got this pump for my sis so she could have a break from the hand pump. It did rest her hands but it's so loud! She has to turn the tv up in the room so everyone can still hear while she pumps. Also, according to my sis the suction isn't as good as with her purple Medela hand pump. It does have battery capability and a plug so it can be portable for when she pumps at work. So it does the job of relieving hand cramping from manual pumping, and it's easily portable but I would look for a quieter stronger pump next time."
10122,1,I've bought 2 other toilet training seats prior to this one and neither fit my elongated toilet seat (high step Kohler elongated toilet). The BabyBjorn fits my toilet seat perfectly due to the adjusting dial you turn to &#34;lock&#34; the seat in position. There are no holes or scary spots showing with this seat so my twin toddlers feel confident getting up on this seat. I have boy/girl twins and this seat fits both nicely. My boy is not as ready to potty train as my girl so I'm not 100% on how well the raised guard will work for stopping urine splashes from him. Happy I spent the extra money to have a seat that fits and is comfortable for them both!
104319,1,"what i like about this gate, is that it keep's my one dog that i have a problem with,going after my cat's away.It's a very good looking and strong gate. easy to use.Like the way it will close after you walk threw it.easy to put together.very happy. Thank you"
12266,1,"I ready many of the reviews before buying this gate. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to much of a selection for a secure top of the stairs gate, so this was my choice. Granted, as many of the negative reviews state, the hardware is not top of the line and you do need to supply your own screws and anchors for sheetrock or concrete walls, but the installation was not that difficult if you're somewhat handy around the house. Since I only use this gate when my granddaughter visits, I found it useful that the gate can be removed when not needed. I've found it to be sturdy, reliable and easy to use."
45210,1,"We were given another gym as a shower gift, and our son liked batting at the toys but wasn't enthralled. I saw this gym, decided to buy it (and sell our other one). It is amazing the difference!I take off some of the toys, and our son plays on his belly or rolls around to pick up the toys I took off. He talks to himself in the mirror, loves watching the flowers when the music is on, and enjoys all of the little toys on and off of the gym. I love that it folds away easily.I would not buy any other gym. I didn't even think I wanted a gym - silly me! I would say this is the most indispensible toy we have. Our son is now 4 months old and will play by himself on the mat for up to 45 minutes. When I get down on the floor next to him, he loves to &quot;talk&quot; and fill me in on what he's been doing!"
181433,0,"I have two of these seats and I love them. The latch system is incredibly easy to use and my son is very comfortable in the seat. I've had the seats for two years now. On two instances my son (at 26 months) reached down and opened the velcro cover over the strap release and has actually released the straps all the way while in the car... And, YES, each time he has been strapped in CORRECTLY (tight with no slack and only able to fit two fingers under the strap). There were a few other instances that week when he tried to do this again but we were able to stop him. Since that week, about six months ago, he now knows it's not safe to touch that part of the seat and he hasn't even tried to loosen it again. Even in spite of this, I love the seats and plan on using them until he outgrows them. I just want to let people know that even strapped in 100% PROPERLY, there is still the chance that your child can reach the strap release. No one can predict all the possible outcomes of the curiosity of a two-year-old. Don't keep blinders on...just because they aren't SUPPOSED to be able to, DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T HAPPEN. (This can be said about any product)."
136253,1,"My baby is the type that needs to be held or she begins to whimper. I was against buying an entertainer because we have a small place and I was afraid I'd have no where to put it. I began to watch my 2.5 month old really like to bounce, sit up, and reach for stuff and thought, you know, maybe we can put the coffee table upstairs and make some room for one. I still had my doubts that it would buy me anything in the long run. I was dead wrong.After reading reviews, I decided on this exersaucer because of the bright colors and activities. You can also bounce with this one too plus it's stationary so I don't have to worry about her ending up elsewhere in the house like the ones with rollers. Once we got it home, my husband put it together and did mention that it took some patience to assemble. We found it to be very sturdy and solid. My baby was almost 3 months by the time we bought it and put her in it. We surrounded her body with towels so she could sit upright. At 3 months old she already is bouncing in it, playing with the roller, and she just located the electronic music/abc/shape/counting book and had a blast pushing the buttons. At the age she is, I do not leave her unattended at all though because she can't sit up on her own just yet...but I highly recommend if you are going to pay this much money for an exersaucer, get it while they are about 2 months + ..don't wait until 6 months. I'd say it keeps her busy for a good 20 to 30 mins, it varies. That is pretty long for this age.Another plus is that it folds up and has a carry handle to pack off to grandma's. Some people mentioned that the dye comes off on one of the toys, I haven't experienced that yet but I plan on making sure she doesn't have her best clothes on just in case it does happen when she figures out how to put them in her mouth. I can't imagine that they would use a dye that would be toxic to babies on a baby toy. Evenflo is a household name and is a good solid baby brand.All in all, it's definitely worth 100 bucks and I consider myself a scrooge on our one income household! I bought everything else used...so this was our splurge toy."
112407,1,I purchase these diapers for my grandson. They are comfortable for him and very absorbent.
6992,1,I always used Pampers. It's great that they're delivered to my door. It makes my life easier.
40017,2,"I had read the reviews for this noisemaker, and had heard that somepeople had complained the volume was too soft - however, there seemed to be enough reviews to the contrary to give me the confidence to buy this.I can not stress this enough. This. product. is. barely. audible.On it's highest volume, it's practically useless.I will be returning this immediately."
37614,1,"I use these wipes for both my girls! I tried Huggies wipes, and they gave my older one diaper rash. These are the only wipes I buy."
65073,1,"This is the best carseat ever! It's amazingly practical and easy to use, plus super comfortable for baby. We will get this same carseat for future kiddos. We're sold on Britax for life."
59446,2,"After purchasing the depot, I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top). I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type."
112657,1,"I was sad when my little girl outgrew the last size (size 2) available in Swaddlers and purchased both Huggies and Pampers for her. The Huggies leaked out of the inside leg seam every single time, so I tried Pampers - both Baby Dry and the Cruisers. Although neither leaked, the Cruisers seemed much easier for her to move around in and the fit is amazing.You can tell pampers has done their baby-research!! Thank you!"
151824,2,"This looks like a great idea, but there is no way to get it to fit, it's way to small. I have a standard graco pack and play. The regular pack and play sheets fits fine."
176239,1,"Cloth diapers have been around forever, and aside from using cloth diapers on my own children, my grandchildren also wore cloth diapers. These cloth diapers are the diapers all of my daughters still swear by to this day, and I still have some folded up inside the dresser drawer from when I babysat the grand kids at our house. I would definitely recommend these cloth diapers to any mother wanting to diaper the old-fashioned way with diaper pins and rubber pants like my daughters and I did."
22853,0,"I have to admit I'm not much of a baby-wearer to start. My son doesn't like to be confined. But, that being said, this sling has been a life-saver a handful of times. Once when he wouldn't nap in his stroller at a friend's BBQ I put him in the sling and he passed right out. And it's also comes in handy for the grocery store when I don't want to mess with the baby bjorn. I'm giving it three stars, however, because I don't think this thing would hold up with daily use. It seems a bit ""homemade"" for that and I don't trust it to hold my son's weight entirely - I am always partially holding him, carrying some of his weight."
47133,1,"We have a 2 year old and 2 month old, and this stroller works great for us. My older son does not like to sit still for long, and the Joovy allows him to move about. He also likes being able to sit or stand. We made a big deal about it being like a train caboose and he ate that up. He asks to use the stroller! The infant seat portion works just fine. The basket underneath is next to impossible to access, so that is a con. I like having the handle bar caddy--I can store car keys, cash/credit card, sippy cups, etc. I recommend buying some hooks to hold a diaper bag since it is a huge hassle to try to retrieve anything from the basket below. I am a petite person, and I can easily push and turn the stroller when it is loaded down with the boys, infant seat, and 2 diaper bags. Some people complain that the older child in the back cannot nap. That was not a big deal to us because we would prefer our son not to nap in the stroller at his age."
154281,1,"These wipes still have scent that smells a little sweet and spicy. Despite that fact it's pretty subtle and is not very strong that it makes you sneeze. I use it with wipe warmers and they work just fine. The only problem is that they have do not contain a lot of liquid so I had to put some water in the wipe warmer device to keep the wipes moisturised enough. It is not a problem unless I forget the wipe warmer. I sometimes use just the wipes in a sealed bag so that I do not take the whole bunch with me. They get dry pretty quickly, unfortunately. Aside from that, my daughter has had no rash from them or any other complaints. They clean pretty well, too, without leaving any residue. I've used them for two years with no problem. It isually takes 2 wipes to wipe her butt, so they are fairly economical despite little moisture. 300 unscented wipes usually last for 3-4 months for us; they are ok for the price. I'd definitely recommend them."
12210,1,I purchased this extension to work with the Kidco G20 Safeway Gate. We extended the gate to approximately 55 inches and it functions very well.
27489,1,I have psoriasis and this soap gives good relief. Also lathers very well. Fair price. I would buy again. thank you
102435,1,My son is 2 years old and he still use this to sleep every night. I would buy this again and again and this is perfect for a rain forest nursery
18743,1,"This products works really well. It takes a bit of jostling to wrap it around a baby while laying down, but once around, it works well.Baby is still able to kick out of the foot pouch, which we've remedied by wrapping something else around the waist. That is the one bummer. A couple of well placed velcro patches would likely solve this problem and make this product perfect."
9635,0,"The potty chair is easy to use, too low to the floor, just not tall enough for my 2 1/2 year old grandson."
139207,1,"While I bought this as a gift, I have already received a note saying that this product was exactly what they wanted, and they love it already. It was on their registry because they saw it in someone else's nursery and fell in love with it. Can't wait to see it first-hand, but sure sounds like a winner!"
104037,1,"Better than I expected. This soap really lathers well, esp. for castile. The smell is a little unusual, but refreshing. I would definitely purchase this again."
65093,1,"Cute product. Comfortable for baby. Can be used from 5 lbs. to 40 lbs. I also own a Britax Marathon which can be used from 5 lbs. up to 65 lbs. At times I do question whether or not I should have just bought 2 Marathons since they can be used for children all the way up to 65 lbs. HOWEVER, the Roundabout is definitely good for those who have small cars! And by the time my child is 40 lbs I will probably be ready for a safety seat change anyway with all the nugget mess it acquires!"
127679,1,"I spent a lot of time trying to decide what crib and mattress combo to get. In the end, we have two of these cribs for our small apartment and are really pleased with them. Our boys have been home only about a week but we already love them. Great for small spaces, love the wheels. Pull them in and out of the nursery into our bedroom or the living room when we need to. Haven't trying the rocking feature yet. My brother put them together very quickly, and although he's good at this kind of thing it couldn't be too hard (took less time than an IKEA dresser). Look nice, too. I know what people are saying about the sticker, I haven't bothered trying to get it off. Who has the time for that with two babies home? We bought the Naturepedic Portable Crib Organic Cotton Mattress to go with themNaturepedic Organic Cotton Portacrib Mattressand they fit perfectly. Also using American Baby CompanyAmerican Baby Company Organic Fitted Cotton Velour Porta-Crib Sheet, NaturalandAmerican Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Portable Fitted Crib Sheet, Naturalto go with them mattresses, which fit well. I thought the organic mattress pads were too soft, so I sent them back. Not a fan of the Naturepedic waterproof pad, too hard to get it to sit right while you are putting on the sheet. The mattress wipes down easily, not getting a waterproof pad. Will update if that was a bad idea."
48302,2,This monitor had way too much static. I could not stand it so I returned it. I wish that someone had warned me that I could barely hear my child because the static was so bad. I would not recommend this monitor.
126954,0,"I was using pampers but tried huggies since they were cheaper(via subscribe option) and had decent reviews. They were good enough until I tried the target brand, Up and up. Amazingly enough, up and up was a better fit for my 2 months old and even cheaper still. In comparison, huggies felt really rough like newspaper and bunched up on her."
173504,1,"For a baby that is always looking for the next thing to do, she absolutely loves her swing. I like the versitility and the mirror underneath the moving leaves and insects. Very cute!"
52892,1,"Our son slept in the papasan for the first 2 months. He just really can relax in it. The incline is perfect; it lays back enough that he sleeps, but not too much that I worry about spit up. I am so glad we bought this! Plus, when I take a shower or fold laundry I just put him in the chair and take him into the bathroom or laundry room with me. He's quite content to just sit there!"
62292,2,"The main ingredient is water! It smells great, but does NOT last.Do not waste your money. Baby lotion lasts longer!"
4655,1,My wife and I use these diapers pretty exclusively. They hold a lot of liquid in there. We use them pretty much throughout they day and have upgraded since our son was a newborn. He uses a different diaper for bedtime (since he sleeps about 11 hours). I recommend them highly and can now get them at our local grocery store.
181340,1,"My Daughter absolutely loves this, we have had it for 4 months now and no complaints! She has really learned to reach and grap and pull herself all around this mat and she is only 22 weeks old! I would recommend this well built Gym!"
51851,1,"I bought this from Amazon last fall. I did so much research and was set on spending about $300 for the Baby Jogger ATS from Babies R Us. Then I found out it was being discontinued and the newer model would be even more expensive. I read so many reviews and hoped and prayed this stroller would work out. I was hesitant knowing it was cheaper than the Baby Jogger brand.I have been quite happy so far. I do run/walk with it, but I'm not an avid runner and a slow one at that- so I don't need a strap. The canopy is not sufficient so I also bought the Kidopotomus -Sun Shade which works well. Early on we had a problem with a flat tire. My hubby bought tire sealant which worked but once we put it on, we had to keep the tires moving for many hours. Luckily it was nice weather so we went for a Super Long walk. I use a bike tire to inflate. I do love the jogger! It is a pain to fold up and can be heavy. I have to wrestle with it a bit to fit in my trunk (Corolla). Overall, I am happy and glad I chose the cheaper In Step. A friend's older Baby Trend Jogger felt pretty sturdy in a nature path recently though."
70361,0,The graphics are great but the stickers constantly peel from the wall and fall down. This is after one day...I'm hoping these stickers last but it looks like they won't :(
177432,1,"I got this as a shower gift and have been extremely happy with it. I was told that I really needed an electric pump to go back to work with, but I couldn't afford the top model Medela pumps. I got a lower model and it took longer to pump 4oz then the Avent manual pump, and my breasts bled the first time I used it! I tried it again once I got back to work, but I have since returned to my Avent manual pump. Unless you can afford the top model Medela, my pick is this pump any day!"
177351,0,"I have had a lot of difficulty getting any suction with this product - it often takes ten minutes or so, with a lot of taking the pump apart and putting it back together before I finally do. Once suction is achieved, it works well."
63518,1,"No doubt about it: this is a big mirror, and the animal adds to the size. That hasn't been a problem for us. The size gives me a good view of my baby, and she enjoys looking at herself and &#34;talking&#34; to the monkey. Good quality mirror, image not distorted."
7045,1,"These are the bigger baby version of Pamper's Swaddlers, so if you are a Swaddlers fan, when you're baby outgrowns them, upgrade to Cruisers. They have the stretchy elastic on the side of the (velcro) tabs, so you get a ""custom fit"" with every change, and the stretch also allows for movement (when the baby goes to bed with a big, full tummy, it shrinks through the night as food digests - these diapers stay snug, due to the stretchy part, and never leak).Huggies has tried to make their own version, and I gamely tried them, only to find the huge elastic panel on the back to be very poorly fitting, and allows EVERYthing to leak out the back - yuck !Pampers has recently added an open-weave cover inside, to assure that the mess seeps through, then keeps it away from baby's skin, which is a great improvement (and I thought they were great BEFORE !).Yes, they ARE basically the most expensive diapers (although they are equally priced to Huggies, and the like), but as with most things, you get what you pay for."
59634,1,"We don't use this product for the fireplace. Instead, we use it to line the tiled step next to our living room. It does the trick. Our baby has not had one bad encounter with that step, and our minds are at ease that there is soft cushioning to line what would otherwise be a very hard and sharp area! We learned about this product from our neighbor, who uses this product for the exact same reason!"
116989,0,"GREAT CONCEPT , LCD, PAN/TILT BUT....IT IS TOO BAD THEY COUDLN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE A PRODUCT W/O ALL OF THE STATIC AND CRACKING! IT IS HORRIBLE. NOT MUCH GOOD IF YOU HVE TO KEEP THE VOLUME OFF & STARE AT THE PICTURE. I HAVE TRIED ALL OF THE CHANNELS, AND MANY LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT OUR HOUSE AND IT IS ALWAYS VERY LOUD. CAN'T WAIT TO GET A REPLACEMENT AND BE FREE FROM THE NOISE AND INTERUPTIONS AT NIGHT!!! I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT SUMMER INFANTS MONITOR!"
12678,2,"We were so excited when we found this item,but we were sadly disappointed. We thought it would be great-but now I am 8 and a half months pregnant and we cannot hear anything-NOT EVEN OUR OWN HEARTBEATS. Do not waste your time or money on this item."
142276,1,"I have a big baby, and this product made it comfortable to carry him, with the lumbar support. It is very sturdy. I recommend."
83124,1,"This sling is great for the breastfeeding mom! My husband and I like to eat out, but it seems that whenever we sit down, our daughter wants to eat too. With the sling, she snuggles next to me and nurses while my hands are free to continue eating. The sling is so comfortable she often falls asleep after she is done eating. It allows me privacy and a warm meal! We had a Snuggli front carrier, but she couldn't nurse while she was in it. It also smushed my breasts, was hard to get around my post-pregnacy waist and (I know this sounds weird) people (strangers) kept touching her when she was in the Snuggli with her feet hanging out. In the sling, she is in my ""personal space"" and people seem less likely to just reach out and ""touch the baby""."
56722,1,"We were cheap when we bought cabinet locks for our kitchen and only put these magnetic locks on the really dangerous stuff like chemicals under the sink and the alcohol cabinet. My husband installed the cheaper open-the-door-push-lever-down type on all the others since it was an easier install. We never had trouble with smushed fingers but our 14 month old figured out how to work the lever type all by himself within a month of the installation. What a waste of time and effort! Also, the lever type of locks give a toddler the impression that the cabinet is ""openable"" whereas they lose interest when the cabinet door doesn't budge at all as with these magnetic locks.I would agree that these are more time consuming to install but MUCH more worth it.The only downside I've found about this item is when you disengage the locks, unless you scotch tape the mechanism in place they tend to want to re-engage."
66011,0,"I have tried both Avent and Dr. Brown bottles and have been somewhat satisfied with both. However, I have the same leaking complaint for both. As for cleaning, Dr. Brown's bottles do require more special attention than does Avent. As for mixing formula in Dr. Brown bottles, I remove the inner parts and attach the storage caps from my medela breast milk storage bottles to skake the formula. I have not experienced any problems with gas that are often associated with mixing and feeding from the same bottle. Perhaps letting is sit a minute to release the air will help. Also, if you don't let your child get to the point to where she's screaming for food, waiting for the bubbles to settle in the shaken bottle is no big deal. Neither Avent or Dr. Brown get two thumbs up, but my baby seems not to mind either one."
52364,1,"It was not easy to follow the trail of bread crumbs to get the advertised rebate and Amazon had to be called on for help in doing that. After much perseverance the rebate check arrived, making this a very good deal for the price. Thank you Amazon."
93322,2,I don't write a lot of reviews actually I think this might be my first. I ordered to of these cots for my 3 year olds. I took the first out of the package and right away I noticed that the middle piece holding the fabric was broken (Held via a plastic piece and screw) I thought oh well I will just send it back because Amazon is amazing like that :). Then I opened the second one and setup it up (Very easy) as he laid on it the middle piece broke (Same exact area on the first one I opened) he slammed his shoulder on the cross bar and was in pan for a few seconds. I sent these back - maybe they had a bad batch of them. The reviews were great. Sorry guys not a gambling man. I gave it a 2 because of ease of setup.
106624,1,"I love this pail-I couldn't live without it!You can buy regular garbage bags (I suggest the pink scented kind) and don't have to worry about refills. Plus this pail holds a LOT of diapers...and doesn't smell up the room.The flipping mechanism is easy and smart. When you open the lid to change the bag...it is a little hard to open, just put the pail between your knees to hold it down the then pull open the top. I can do it with no problem and I'm a weakling! Good luck!"
11978,2,"I too received the Sassy brand, rather than what is pictured and advertised, as I was moving too fast to read the feedback. One star (ideally, less). This MUST be remedied."
56656,0,"We've gone through half a dozen of these locks over the last couple of years. They are the sturdiest fridge locks I could find, short of bolting a padlock set up to the fridge. But they do have one major flaw. The lock holds by a tiny little plastic lip on the latch, and that little lip isn't a molded piece of the latch, but glued on. Well. One good pull from an adult guest who can't figure out why the fridge won't open, or the determined day after day yanks of a little toddler, and eventually that little lip breaks off, and there goes the whole set up. Very frustrating, but a single latch will last a few months, and is still the best I can find for this class fridge lock.Remember to wash the fridge edge well and clean with alcohol before you apply the latch. Then it stays stuck. Never had the glue come off."
74929,1,This is working for our purpose to keep the little ones out of the kitchen but I do wish it had a gate due to the fact that we have almost hurt ourselves badly by climbing over it.
11242,1,My sister gave me these pacifiers as a gift. We got the ladybug and the bumblebee. Well my son would not take any pacifiers except these. They have little nubbies on the end that I think he really liked and they fit good. I know it says 6 months+ but we used them when he was newborn. They are so cute too! Of course every baby is different and you just have to keep trying products until you find one they like.
74437,1,"Perfect size for my two year old nephew, made him more excite to eat with utensils seeing his fav cartoon!"
16753,1,"COULDA SAVED ME 12$ TO JSUT GO TO THE STORE AND PURCHASE IT MYSELF, BT THATS THE ADVANTAGE OF ONLINE SHOPPING! IT IS SOO CUTE AND MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT. VERY EASY TO INSTALL AS WELL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WITH A LITTLE GIRL ."
21728,1,"I was looking for something that wasn't all denim or completely blue and I fell in love with this set. My baby's room is the best room in the house! I have just about everything you can find to go with this set and when I was pregnant, it wasn't easy to find. I am so glad they are carrying more of it at Babies R Us now. I also found the perfect paint to go with it. In case you are wondering and like the color blue, it is &quot;Celestial&quot;, by Sherwin Williams. I also painted the trim in the room &quot;Orange Frenzy&quot;. Everyone thinks it's just gorgeous and the baby seems to love it in there."
102179,2,What I love: the top sheet tucks into the mattress - very convenient for a fidgety 2 yr old.What I hate: the fabric balls up & is not very comfortable after a couple of washings.
118064,0,"I'm 50/50 on this one. I've used it w/ success, but it requires planning. I always activate it 30-40 minutes before I need it. The (bmilk) bottles warm well under these conditions. It took me a while to figure out how to handle w/ out triggering. I usually gently lay it across the top of my bag until I need it. I have 2 so I can rotate them if needed.This is my theory, ""you get what you pay for"". It's $9.99. You get about that much quality and value. I'm satisfied, but they aren't as great as I'd like them to be."
107815,2,"I bought this pump on vacation when I accidentally left a part to my medela harmony manual pump at home. This pump is awful. As previous posters have said, it's leaky and creaky. It has far too many parts to disassemble and clean. Medela's pump is easier to clean, has fewer parts, and in my opinion, works better. A FAR superior product. It's an overall better design. I'll keep the avent as an emergency backup, but really, I wish I could just toss it."
24286,0,"I purchased the mini co-sleeper which is great. However, I was very upset to find out that the sheets were $15 a piece, especially when you need at least 2-3!! What a rip off. I would suggest trying to find a generic fitted sheet at a store that would fit and sew on some velcro."
130783,1,"This swing is a true life saver for us. But we would suggest a couple of points to the manufacturer that can be recified if possible:1) The bar that connects the swing seat to the swing body is we guess made out of steel. If the manufacturer could have a cushion padding running around the bar it would help. The reason being, my baby girl has the involuntary habit of stretching herself as we take her out of the swing. Unless we are really careful, she ends up banging her little head on that bar and starts to cry. These days as she is growing up she tends to position her feet on the white partition in the swing seat and then gives a stretch. This position is a sure fire way to bang the head on the steel bar if the baby is over 20 inches in height.2)The gruggling noise that the motor makes when we turn on the swing wakes up our baby (we read a review where one other parent has also mentioned the same point). This could also be something that the manufacturer can consider rectifying."
86147,0,"I LOVE my summer video monitor! This model doesn't have a remote to move the camera. The next model up- with 2.5"" color screen does. You will have to move the camera manuely. Not so bad if you have a baby that stays in one place. Mine, however, does not. Also, buy an extra camera, one for the playroom and one for the bedroom. This monitor gives me such a peice of mind- plus I LOVE watching my little guy sing nd play as he wakes up from a nap!"
167997,1,These diapers are the only diapers that don't give my long 7 month old irritation on her inner leg. The price is unbeatable and its DELIEVERED!! Its a win-win!
65644,1,THE ONLY ONE THAT YOU'LL EVER NEED! I BOUGHT 2 AND SOLD MY OTHER STROLLERS.
17804,0,"I think this would fit one sandwich, snack, small drink and small snack, and MAYBE a small ice pack. you might be able to squish one more thing of the list in. For the purpose I wanted it for, it was too small. I was looking for something bigger for Disneyland, but for an afternoon walk, it would be fine. It also looked complicated to install. Didn't try since i knew i was returning it. I'm just going to put a cooler bag in the basket of the stoller."
22147,0,"I do not use these bags to pump milk directly into. I don't find that method easy or convenient at all. I am always terrified of milk spilling or something falling into the bag while pumping. With that being said, I still purchase these bags because I can't seem to find 50-count Medela bags WITHOUT the adapter on Amazon. I prefer the thickness of the Medela over the flimsiness of the Lansinoh (I had soooo many frozen bags get holes in them). If this is the only way to buy them on here, then so be it. I give this product 3 stars because it seems like a waste of plastic to me (I just throw the adapters away), but the bags are great for milk storage."
23994,0,Halo sleep sack has greatly improved my sons sleep as he transitions from bassinet to crib. Highly recommended 5 stars!This was ordered thoroughly amazon by the web story [...]. This web store gave me a faulty tracking number from ups. I could not contact the business because every extension for their customer service had a full voicemail and could not be left messages or speak to anyone. Amazon intervened and successfully made them contact me after 2 weeks. They told me they would resend the product. Fine! After an additional week they emailed me to inform me they were out of this product and would need to issue a refund. Needless to say after one month I purchased the sleep sack elsewhere. Never use [...]!!
75619,0,"We bought this for our granddaughter. My husband puts furniture togather for a living. It tooka long time to put togather. Parts were not labled properly. Some parts were already put togather, but the screws were put in crooked, so the the drawers don't close. It looks nice matches the crib and changing table. But was a pain in the but to put togather."
131214,1,This changing table (espresso) has held up for over two years and a set of twins! Would buy it again! :) It is still in great shape...we had no issues with drawers either.
151290,1,"I was having a hard time finding a mirror that works with my car. I have a Nissan Rogue, and the backseat headrests are not adjustable. I believe other Nissan vehicles are built the same way. This wraps around the headrest horizontally. All other mirrors only worked with adjustable headrests and had to be inserted under the headrest vertically. So happy I found this so I can now see my baby boy when driving! :)"
68093,1,"I ordered this for my baby boy due in 6 weeks and it is as beautiful as the picture! It is in perfect condition after washing it, the colors and patterns are lovely and can blend-in with virtually any decor, crib color (ours is black) and gender. The animals are absolutely adorable and the quality is fantastic.... there's nothing NOT to love! MORE than satisfied!! Great price, too...it was $40 less here than listed on other sites. :)"
75824,1,"I bought several of these after I bought a new minivan with leather seats. I didn't want my carseats to damage my new seats. So far, they have worked great!"
107937,0,"I'm a first time mom, who knew nothing about breastfeeding or breastpumps, I bought the pump because all of my other baby feeding supplies are by Avent.The long and short of it is: the pump is very convenient, very simple to use (even for new mums), neat and compact. The downside is that when you get your ""flow"" going the pump's valve pops out and you have to stop pumping, dis-assemble, sterilize and re-assemble.This is no fun when you have two engorged boobies and a screaming baby!! At one point I had considered Krazy gluing the valve in place!!Once you know that it will be a start and stop process, this pump is perfect!!New mama!!"
178277,1,"I've used the Pigeon brand (I believe it's from Japan) milk storage bags- those are the best-quality bags I've ever used. Unfortunately, they're also very difficult to find. These Lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1/3 of Pigeon's price. Not bad at all! My baby and I travel a lot so I bring along my stock of bmilk in these Lansinoh bags. No mishaps thus far. Highly recommended."
154255,0,It says they are unscented but they smell awful. Unscented should be just that. They work just fine but I wont be buying them again as I hate the smell.
11657,1,"I really like this snug-tub for many several reasons. First, it has a suction cap for saftey and you can attached it to either the wall or the floor of your bath tub. Secondly, with its air filled sides, even if your baby accidently bumbs her head, it will not caused any pain. The sides are also very comfortable and pillow-like and she can rests her head there (looking up) while I wash her hair. That actually makes washing hair much easier and prevents soap from entering into her eyes. Thirldly, unlike a bath seat, you do not have to fill your entire bath tub with water and that really saves a lot! The only thing I add onto it is a non-slip rubber mat to its floor. This is much better then having a bath seat because it is much harder to wash your baby's creases with all the bars in between."
159363,1,"This is been a lifesaver for me with my fussy 6-week old girl. She is high maintenance about going to sleep. This is one of the items we rely on to get her to fall asleep. I like how this bouncer is angled so that it is not super upright like some other bouncers I've seen. This makes it easier for her to sleep in if needed. The only thing I'd want to be different is I wish there was an automatic bounce function (like the auto-vibrate function). My foot gets tired from bouncing for so long (if our girl is not in a deep sleep, she'll wake up if the bouncing stops). The puppy toy bar is very cute and plays cute music. Our baby started noticing it and staring at it around 4 weeks. Before that we just left it off."
133326,0,"OK, so like most of the concerned parents out there who use the Born Free bottles, I too switched to this brand because the plastics do not contain BPA. However, we just broke our third bottle (plastic, mind you---NOT glass). The first two broke when my daughter dropped them onto a linoleum floor and asphalt parking lot; this most recent one she dropped onto our hardwood floor, from a distance of no more 18 inches high. We have never boiled our Born Free bottles, and my 18 month old daughter is no Hercules, so I do not expect plastic bottles to break consistently like this. When I contacted customer service, they claim that they have never heard of this problem before and promptly replaced the bottles at no charge to me. They score big points with me for the free replacement, but I find it hard to believe my child is the only one out there who has broken one, let alone THREE, of these bottles. We'll be switching to one of the other BPA-free alternatives out there (and yes, there ARE other choices available)."
119820,0,"I wanted a simple cotton cover to use instead of the heavy velour one that came with the MBF Deluxe. This one fit the bit and was very adorable, so I snatched it up.Pros:- Cute- Cotton is more comfy for my and my baby in warmer weather- Cotton doesn't get scuzzy as quickly as the fuzzy velour version- I don't miss the velcro of the Deluxe cover at all... I prefer this oneCons:- Faded badly during the FIRST wash. Looks old already. :(- Fabric is very thin and the seams don't seem very durable. Time will tell.I'd still buy it again, but I was a little disappointed in the quality."
69638,1,"We went from a bassinet for our son, to this playpen. It was past time for our son to get this because he was escaping from the bassinet and was way too big for it. I was concerned that he wouldn't be able to sleep because he would feel like there was too much room. He is more that satisfied with all the space after coming from a cramped bassinet and its funny to find him spread out and in all sorts of weird positions in this spacious pen. We use this mainly for sleeping but occasionally I put him in here when I need to keep him contained for a bit. There's a lot of room for him to play in there. Follow the directions or else the sides won't stay up."
60733,0,I recieved this at my shower and I did register for it. It worked great before my fiancee started to throw his table food eating son's poopy diapers into it with the infant plastic. The plastic can abosolutely absorbs and retains odors. I cleaned it with bleach and steaming hot water and the stench still didn't go away. The refills are also REALLY expensive. We don't make much money so spending that much on refills doesn't make sense. It's relatively easy to use and easy to refill and empty but it's best before your baby starts solids.
61153,0,We received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift and were not impressed. The smell was aweful and we had to fight with it to get the ring to turn. After a week of frustration I went out and bought a Diaper Dekor Plus. I'll admit that the smell isn't pleasant when you change the bag but it is a lot easier than the Diaper Genie. Another nice feature of the Dekor is you can keep one hand on the baby and use your foot to open the container to dispose of the diaper unlike the Genie. Spend a little more and make your life easier!
164628,2,"I made a huge mistake by buying the baby dry after reading through the reviews. I thought that for the price, why not try them. What a huge mistake! I should have just bought a smaller amount to try them first. Instead we have been using these for over a month now and I have had to clean up a poop spill at least every other day. My baby was 4 months old when we started using these and since he is not eating solids yet, the poop is pretty runny. The baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on. It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the HuggiesSnug & dry from now on, The Snug and dry from huggies absorb much better that those lousy ones, Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Snug and dry or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SNUG AND DRY!!"
16246,1,"I love this blanket. No more sitting on towels, getting sand on them, setting them down next to each other etc. This is just wrapped and ready to go always, love it! I should have paid closer attention to the sizing thought, I just looked at the picture and it looked so big in the picture but in fact it's not that big. I do with it was a bit larger especially for the price. Two adults can sit on it with some of their stuff on it but that's it. If my husband and I use it and try to put our baby down on it it really isn't big enough. Just FYI."
81302,1,"This makes for a wonderful baby shower gift for the first time parents to be. It includes the necessities for the nursery and diaper bag such as a comb and brush, a medicine dispenser, finger tip toothbrush and toddler toothbrush, a rattle, mirror and different other tools they will need to get through the baby's first years. A must have for the first time parents."
48110,0,"Well, this item worked but I was not comforable that my child wouldn't fall out of bed. It was hard to get blown up really full and still moved quite a bit even when strapped in tightly because the strap streatches too much. I ended up putting it further into the mattress because I was affraid my child would roll under it."
150979,2,"I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true."
114289,1,bought this for my gandbaby (8 months)and it was a great investment. Had company with an older child (2 years old) and worked for him also.
125628,0,"We have several Manhattan Toy Company toys and I have to say this is my son's least favorite. We love the Whozit, the Winkle and the Zulu, but he rarely plays with this one. He'll shake it a couple of times and then throw it to the side. I am slightly disappointed since the others were such big hits at our house."
134787,2,I loved the idea of these. We have hard wood and tile floors through out our house. However these didn't stay in place and were too tight on my daughters legs. I know of another person who bought them and said the same thing. Too bad I could have really used them!
137841,0,I bought this for daughter & she loves it. I just wish the color would change.
37190,0,"Cool, bag - Target shipped the wrong one so I ended up getting one direct from the manufacturer. As always I love Amazon's return policy and even with other companies errors Amazon takes care of you. Target on the other hand made this such a miserable purchase experience I will not purchase from them through Amazon again. Combine the embarrassment with the time I wasted to no avail in their store trying to get this handled quickly and it will be a while until I bother going to their locations again."
158711,1,"Another great product from Halo brand. Really love that this is cotton, the perfect weight for summer months (as I find the micro-fleece ones too warm in summer). The zipper is easy to close and well made so there is no chance of it getting caught on baby's sensitive skin. Highly recommended."
155810,1,"Love this line of soaps. Thought this was a GREAT DEAL for a set of 3; not so much for 1. Only one arrived in the package. When I complained, they quickly gave me a refund for the prorated portion (2) I did not receive. This is why I love Amazon; they are definitely awesome at responding to customers in a good way. They said they could not send a partial set, but wouldn't there be two strays somewhere if I only got one?"
8041,1,"These wipes are well worth the money. I love the scent and use them in between baths as a quick body wash or while traveling. Our 4-month old has very sensitive skin, and these are super gentle. Since they are a bit pricey, we use them in addition to having unscented ones in the house."
17938,1,"If you want a potty chair/step stool and don't need any frills, this is the chair for you. We got this for potty training at Grandma's house. The price was perfect and it works fine. It is a good height for a smaller child--my 18 month old can get on and off very easily."
104795,1,"First I purchased the Britax Boulevard and then The First Years True Fit. Both were huge and bulky. When fully tightened in the rear-facing position using the LATCH system, both could be grasped by their bases from the front seat and pulled forward, pushing baby's head into the back seat. The same could be done by just pushing on the backs of these carseats (in the rear-facing position), so baby's face would slam into the back seat in a head-on collision!The Sunshine Radian is different! It has a detachable base which, when installed in the rear-facing position, fully fills in the gap between the carseat and seat back. No bulky towels that shift, no water noodles that get squished down. And a SNUG FIT! Additionally, there is a very easy floor tether that secures this carseat further, even in the rear-facing position (The First Years True Fit offers no such tether, and Britax's rear-facing tether is strung over baby's head!) and even if your car doesn't come manufactured with a specific tether point!The mesh fabric stays dry and cool even on the hottest days, there's plenty of leg room even in the rear-facing position, and this whole seat fits (albeit snuggly) in the backseat of my 2004 Saturn LW300 (a very small backseat!). Also, there's a little card pouch to fill out with your child's medical information in case of an accident so emergency personel can immediately treat your child!"
20154,1,"I bought these with the *slow flow* nipples for my granddaughter who having an awful time spitting up and seemed to be having belly aches using the standard ones this has stopped all of that,she is nursed but was taking a bottle when mom was at work she started to refuse to nurse from her bottle and would cry fro hours so after getting on Amazon and reading up on all the different types of bottles and nipples I decided to get these and thank God I did because Ayla is now taking her bottles without any fuss no more spitting up and belly aches and crying.Like some of the other people we havent had any problems with the bottles leaking or the lettering coming off.I bought the the 9oz. too be careful because it said they were coming with the *slow flow nipples* and came through with the fast flow which isnt what I wanted so we'll have to buy new nipples..dont know why they didnt come with the slow flow ones so be sure you check before you order them maybe Amazon needs to fix that,other than that these bottles are great and Ayla seems to love them and so do we."
25251,1,"We have a tempur-pedic bed, which if anyone reading this has one knows that they are MUCH higher than most beds! So these leg extensions came in great use to raise our baby's cosleeper up to match the height of the bed. They were easy to put on, fit great, and were very sturdy. Definitely recommend if you need them!"
92623,2,"Not what I was hoping it would be. It works, and the install is easy, but the cheap little set screw they us to lock the arm down striped out right away. Luckily the arm sits in the holder without any problems as of yet. We could always glue it in too.The other annoying thing is the push button to open the toilet. We've seen one without the push button and it worked much better than this one. The lip can still be lifted up enough to drop things in which is bad if that is what you are trying to prevent.We might replace it."
144336,1,We really like this Britax marathon car seat. We read a lot of reviews from people that had previously purchased it and based our decision to buy it on that. I can say that we have not been disappointed and it gives us comfort knowing that our daughter is in something that is safe.
31013,1,"As a mom of three and having owned a wide variety of strollers over the years I love the way this stroller looks and rolls out of the box. To me, this is such a lightweight, easy to fold, unfold and load into the trunk item. It rolls so smoothly and turns on a dime. The parent holder looks so cool and CAN be WASHED!! My three year old son fit well on the back seat and the smile he had on his face when I pointed out the handles so he could stand securely on the back told me he'll actually stay on this in the mall. My six year old, 43 pound daughter rode on the back with no weight in the front seat and the stroller felt sturdy and not at all like tipping back. Out of the box this beats any of the Peg Perego or Graco strollers we've owned in the past. I'll update this review after I've used it with the new baby on the front and put some miles on this wonderful stroller!12/20/2008 After using this stroller for over a year and a half I still love it. My now just turned five year old loves to sit or stand on the back and I almost never have to fight to get him to stay on it. Practically, my older child has to sit a little hunched forward when the baby's sleeping and it's reclined all of the way back, but he can stand with no problem. Also, it's a little hard to get my diaper bag in the attached storage area, but that's just me being picky. The parent storage is wonderful and I'm so glad I have the zippered area for keys and can put my phone and drink and other stuff safely tucked away. Airline boarding passes fit perfectly! 1 1/2 years later it still pushes effortlessly and is perfect rounding clothes racks a the mall and navigating at restaurants. I love my stroller and still recommend it to people that ask about it."
65826,1,I was so happy to find this on amazon.com and it was definitely worth it for the price. I often have to make bottles on the go or at other people's houses and this allows me to mix formula within SECONDS with virtually no bubbles! I am still using Medela 5oz bottles and it fits easily inside. Just be careful the first time you use it; it goes so fast that it could splash up on you if you aren't paying attention and you leave it in there for too long.
154506,0,"I find these wipes adequate. They do not feel nearly as plasticy as Huggies or Pampers which I definitely like. However, they are still not fully biodegradable or flushable which in my opinion is their major flaw. I can`t figure out why companies are still making wipes not biodegradable. I use Nature babycare most of the time, but I will buy these when in a jam. They work just fine and would choose them over Huggies or Pampers anyday. I just wish they would make them biodegradable."
110810,1,"I just bought this for my 4 month old. She has been teething, I believe, and has been trying to put everything in her mouth lately. I have been using this more as a teether than just a toothbrush because she loves the feel of it on her gums. It is also small and light enough for her to maneuver into her mouth herself."
40807,1,The pampers can really fast. I was not expecting anything until the next two days. But it came actually two days early.
126314,1,"These diapers are an excellent value. By using Amazon mom and the subscribe and save feature, I cannot match this price anywhere- even with coupons!"
125825,1,I'm super glad that I don't have to order these anymore. We have hit the promised land of potty training. These are a good price and it's so convenient for the busy mom.
165270,0,"These diapers are very economical, but I have found my baby's stomach and chest soak and wet many mornings if he has slept more than 5 hours. I was already excited my 19 wk old was sleeping longer hours, but I constantly had to worry when he cried in the morning because he was hungry or soaked and most of the time he was soaked. Outside of the night sleeps, this diaper was fine, but I had a relative purchase some Huggies while out and those seem to hold up better through the night sleeps and allows me to have some peace when I go to bed."
174149,1,"I bought the Papasan Cradle Swing for my little guy when he was about 3 weeks. The fact that it can lay almost flat and is cushy, I felt a little more comfortable about having him in it...he LOVED it! One thing that Fisher Price did upgrade in subsequent model swings (namely the Rainforest Cradle Swing) is that they included an ac adaptor. This swing could have used that feature in a major way. It takes 4-D batteries and believe me if you have a fussy baby who loves to swing to calm down, you are going through a lot of batteries and they are EXPENSIVE! I like the neutral colors...you can put this swing somewhere formal and it doesn't stick out like a grotesque baby product (for those of us who do not prefer the flashy patterns on most baby items today). I have owned this swing for about a month and the electronic component for the songs and noise may have a glitch which requires a phone call to Fisher Price. The mirror above the seat has been very entertaining as has the mobile. Overall a great product."
130954,0,"We bought this to take along on a road trip to visit family, and we used it every day. It didn't take up much room in the car, and we used it for our 3-1/2 month old in restaurants and at people's homes who didn't have any other baby gear. After our trip, we kept it in the car in case we needed it for trips to grandma's or going out to eat. However, our now 4-1/2 month old is almost too big for it! He's only 13 lbs, and the product description says for babies up to 25 lbs. He's starting to try sitting up, and if he ever did while in this seat, he'd topple out. So, it's time to put this away already. I wish we'd bought it when he was about 8 weeks old, so we'd have gotten more use out of it, but it was only $20 and we certainly got our money's worth. The attached toys were pretty much useless, they don't reach far enough for the baby to chew on them, which is what he really wants to do with everything these days."
1538,1,Seventh Generation wipes never cause allergic reactions in my children's sensative skin. The price is excellent and the delivery time was spot on! I will certainly continue my subscription for this product.
60411,2,"My 7 months gets too active during bathtime so I bought this to replace myFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub. It is bigger which is great but it is also very slippery for an active infant. My infant would crawl or tried to stand up causing her to slipped hitting her body and head into the safety supports which are hard plastic mounds. Bathing became difficult and painful for her so I stopped using it and got something with a flat even surface like aHoppop Bato Bath Tub, Limewhich worked out quite nicely. I would only used this if my infant just lay during bath like a newborn but she doesn't. I would also recommend getting some anti slip stickers if you're still going to get this. Will give it another try once she can stand on her own."
42122,2,"I had the Nuby 5 ounce sippy and my son took to that but I wanted a sippy with a lid to keep the spout clean during travel. I saw this in a 2-pack at Meijer and thought that it was perfect since it held more liquid and had a lid too. But this leaked from the spout from the get go!I ended up buying a new one, such a waste of money this was!"
88492,0,"he hates getting in it and i find the side attachments difficult to use with such a heavy child and the adult buckles are basically all in the back this makes it difficult to attach with only one person but, once in he seems so nice and secure and goes to sleep almost instantly."
168940,1,"We love these diapers and found that they are the best fitting. They are very soft to the touch and seem to prevent a myriad of potential ""blow-outs."" Because of this, we are loyal Pampers patrons."
62881,2,"We had the original Diaper Genie, and although it was difficult to change the refills at first, we thought it worked well. (until our son was about a year old, when it developed this interminable smell, which would not leave even after cleaning it with full-strength bleach). Now we are expecting our second son, and my 2 year old was helping me put one of his diapers in the New Diaper Genie, and somehow managed to break the entire lid assembly, exposing two small gears that would be choking hazards to a small child. I was very surprised and disappointed."
92814,2,I loved the idea when i saw it. Bought it for Christmas last year and my son used it about 5 times it was awkward for him being in that position for more than a minute. so maybe your child will love it but mine didnt.
54308,1,My baby really enjoys this mobile. She will get so excited. The music is great and the colors are great. The only thing I didn't like was the fact it doesn't hold on to the crib so well. It is a little loose. If my baby didn't love it so much I wouldn't use it because I hate that it's not so secure to the crib.
46364,0,This is ok for kids who can't stand yet. I enjoyed this while my baby was still crawling but as soon as she's able to stand up and lean on the gate I wasn't so happy anymore because it's quite flimsy. I'll be getting the super XT and see if that's better since reviews are much better for that one.
111772,1,"The Evenflo top of stair gate is a good find. Relatively easy to install, simple design, and sturdy. We have three of these (3-story house with a second set of stairs).To install, we needed to be a little creative to account for the plaster walls (not great with screws) and baseboard (sticks out further than walls). We attached a small piece of wood (same thickness as baseboard) to the plaster wall. This evened it up and gave the screws something better to latch on to. It's not necessarily pretty, but it works quite well and the baby is safe."
95151,1,This is a very helpful device with some children like mine... It works pretty well.
44136,0,This product would be okay if it fit over my tub spout. Only get this if you have a standard size tub spout. Also it is very hard plastic.
74015,1,"I bought this stroller to accommodate my 3 year old as well as our new born. It has been a huge help, it is easy to open and close, while holding one baby in one arm as well as a diaper bag. The seat does not recline that much but kids fall asleep in the oddest places anyway. The backseat also has limited room for sitting the child in the back will have to sit very upright. My daughter did not mind it at all, and now she is four and still has no problem with it. She enjoys being able to see her sister in front of her."
105324,0,"I believe my original rating was 4 or 5 stars, but I have definitely changed my mind. I'm not the only one, I see. This diaper pail is a great concept, easy to use, no special liners, you don't have to ""open"" it to dispose of a diaper... however it absolutely does not hold the odor in! Very disappointing. It is fine for wet diapers, but forget about ""messy"" diapers. Even wet diapers have an odor that soon permeates. The pail needs to be emptied every few days, which seems a waste since the trash liners are only a 1/3 full. But, I still use it and will continue to walk the messy diapers outside, where they belong! It would be great if they could come up with a companion piece that helps eliminate odor that we can put in the bottom of the pail, nothing I've tried works."
184641,1,"We bought the lilac sheet because it matched the Lemonade bedding set. It does stain easily, but BRU has &quot;sheet savers&quot;. They secure to the sides of the crib and protect the sheet from being stained. After I discovered these, there weren't anymore stains on the sheet."
88358,0,"The nasal bulb is very hard to use. Only pieces I use most often is the nail cutter & comb, sometimes. Don't see much use of other pieces much, even if the kid is small."
31424,0,"We use Playtex vent-air and Avent bottles. Though the avent 8oz bottles fit perfectly all the way around the bottom, and on the top we put the 4 oz bottles for little random feedings when I know hes not going to eat more than 4 oz. Then we use one of the pegs on top for the inner pieces. Now when your storing that many bottles one of the larger pegs on the bottom or in our case two are dedicated ONLY to the nipples, which we have to stack several on top of each other. My only issue with this bottle rack is that I wish it was larger. And not round, the caps we end up putting them on the bottom towards the center which make them not sturdy and they end up falling out or are extremely hard to reach when you need them. You need to take off some bottles and them reach in. I would like it alot better if it was rectangular instead . The spinning would not be necessary then."
175655,1,"When our baby came home from the hospital, he wouldn't sleep more than an hour at a time and was a master at getting out of his swaddled receiving blankets. On the third night we tried the halo swaddle sleepsack and he slept for 4 hours straight. The velcro works like a charm and it's extremely secure. I also feel that it's a lot safer than a traditional swaddle with receiving blankets, because if he did manage to get his arms out, he still won't end up with blankets covering his nose/mouth. Now he's six weeks old and will sleep for 7 hours with the swaddle, but no more than 3 without it.A tip for those who say the baby is ""escaping"": make sure the first flap goes UNDER the second arm (see the directions on the package. (ie left flap OVER right arm and UNDER left arm, then right flap OVER left arm and fasten with velcro) This will help immensely and keep baby snug and swaddled.I also recommend the fleece option for those in colder climates. We keep our baby in a long sleeved t-shirt/onesie and this swaddle and he's comfortably warm. Also, the fleece dries more quickly in the dryer than the other sleepsacks (we have both the fleece and 100% cotton sleepsacks), which is important because the multiple layers of the sleepsack sometimes makes the inside not dry completely and it then needs to be hung on a hanger to finish air-drying. We've never had this issue with the fleece one because of the material.A definite must-have for every baby!"
179048,1,I LOVE THESE BOTTLES. I USED THEM FOR MY TWO YEAR OLD AND NOW FOR MY TWO MONTH OLD. THE VENT WORKS. THE BABY SUCKS THE MILK AND THE VENT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE LET THE AIR COME IN SO THAT THE NIPPLE DOES NOT COLAPSE LIKE THE TRADITIONAL BOTTLES DO.THE BABY GETS MORE MILK AND LESS AIR. THE VENT ON THE BOTTOM ALLOWS THE AIR TO GET THROUGH SO WHEN THE BABY IS SUCKING AIR DOES NOT GO IN THROUGH THE NIPPLE CAUSING HER TO DRINK AIR AND GET GAS I LOVE THESE BOTTLES.
124658,2,This gate isn't a pressure mount. It's definitely not portable. It pressure mounts onto plastic things that you SCREW into the doorway. No thanks. I'm disappointed that it was misrepresented in the description and I'll be sending it back.
166311,1,These diapers are amazing for babies that have a longer torso and a smaller waist... We tried Huggies on our baby boy and he always wet out of them. The only time that he wets out of Pampers is when it is time to move up to the next size!! I am a HUGE fan of Pampers!
98692,1,"I have tried out quite a few carseats in my 7 1/2 years as a parent, and bar none, Britax standards are THE highest. My daughter had grown out of her roundabout, and then marathon, and I was just not ready to give up the safety of the 5 point harness (she was 5). I found the Regent, which I believe was slated to be discontinued, and purchased 3 (mine, daddys, grandparents/other). My daughter is now 7 1/2 yrs old, 2nd grade and WILL NOT give up her 5 pt harness Regent for anything...not even the pretty pink and gray Britax winged boosters we purchased nearly a year ago! She loves being able to ""relax"" and not have to worry about shifting around in the seat...and an added benefit to falling asleep without crimping your neck on long journeys.Yes, it is a BIG carseat!I have ours installed in the passenger side of the Toyota 4 runner, and it fits great. Nice and tight, so secure.Yes, we only have room for one other second row passenger to fit safely, but really, that has never become an issue. We had a Mazda minivan before the Toyota, and we could fit both Regents in the captains chairs and if we had to, 2 more Regents in the third row seating. My neighbor bought one and she has it in her Jeep cherokee just fine."
122148,2,"When I registered for baby items, it didn't know if I would use something like this. I always thought it looked strange when people walked around with thier little ones strapped to themselves. Once my son was born, I realised how great a carrier could be, and I was thankful that someone bought this off my registry.I tried so hard to like this product. The problem is, you have to try very hard to make it work for you. If you can borrow someone's Baby Bjorn, do so. Once you can compare the two brands you will see why the extra money is worth it.The snugli was very cumbersome. The straps just do not make sense. Again, I liked this product fine, until I borrowed a Baby Bjorn for two days.My husband, being a new Daddy, wanted to use it too. Well, that meant I had to keep adjusting the staps, which TAKES A LONG TIME. Plus, you can not put the baby in easily. You would have to lay him/ her down, or have someone help you. I think this defeats the whole purpose of using a device to keep your hands free.Plus, my son kept sweating; the fabric isn't very breathable. I found he slumped down into the snugli all the time. Once we switched, we didn't have these problems.It's a great idea, but you get what you pay for. I recommend registering for this item, then return it to Babies R Us for a Baby Bjorn. I'm soooooo gald I did. I still use our B B, and my son is nearly 8 months old. I would have stopped using the Snugli a long time ago. It takes 15 second to put on and strap the baby into the Baby Bjorn (I timed it for a friend). It took much longer to use the snugli; that's a big difference when you're in a store and your baby begins to wail..."
158600,1,"We started using HALO sleep sacks when our daughter was an infant. Now at 14 months, we are still going strong with sleep sacks! At her age, it is quite safe to place a blanket in the crib, but she is constantly kicking it off and I lay awake worrying if she is warm enough. The sleep sack keeps our TODDLER warm and toasty!"
63030,1,"I wanted to start off with fresh tubes after using my Medela pump for one year with my first child. I don't know if that is necessary, but the pump had sat idle for almost a year, so I thought I'd play it safe.These tubes are exactly the same as the original tubes that came with my pump. They work perfectly and I'll probably order another pair when my third child arrives! If you can't get them for free from Medela (apparently many have had success with that), then this is the place!"
51822,2,"So I love the ease in which the stroller moves, but there is a serious safety flaw! The breaks do not work! I found this out on a hill, which was no fun. We ordered this stroller last week and it arrived timely, we put it together (with horrid instructions) and realized there was no break bar. There were only two break pads (one on each wheel). However, the break pads have holes in them where there should be a bar. We figured that they must have left this out of our package. As they were closed over the weekend, we took it out for a spin. I pushed the right break pad and it looked as if it locked. Before I could get my foot to the other side, the stroller started rolling down the hill with my five-month old daughter in it!I called InSTEP as soon as they opened and informed them of this missing part. They informed me that this is a design change and they did away with the bar. WHAT??? This is a safety change, not a design change. They are clearly cutting corners here, to the detriment of the safety of our wee ones! They didn't change the break pads (as they still have the holes) to use them without the bar, they just stopped providing a bar.There is even a strap that should be attached to the missing bar. Jan at InSTEP said they stopped including them two years ago and she doesn't know why.STOP CUTTING CORNERS TO PAD YOUR WALLETS INSTEP AT THE COST OF SAFETY!!!"
155202,1,my daughters room is adorable with these added friends. she loves them too and is always pointing to them and laughing
14604,2,"My son is now only 4 weeks old and I have been using these bottles since his birth. It seems that the more I wash and sterilize them, the more I get leaks in them. In the middle of the night feedings, he's getting all wet, and so am I. I try to fix the problem; he's screaming all over the place. Don't waste your time with Avent bottles."
36857,1,"Hands down, the most indispensable baby product I bought when I had my baby. We had trouble at first with breast-feeding, and the boppy was a godsend. It made a huge difference by helping me be comfortable and giving me both hands free. In addition to breast-feeding comfort, it was useful for more comfortably holding a sleeping baby for a long period of time (my daughter was very colicky as a young baby and would not sleep unless someone was holding her). Once the baby was asleep on the boppy after nursing, I could carefully transfer the boppy/baby pair to my husband's lap so I could have a break. We also used it to prop her up as she got bigger, sitting her in the middle of the C with soft supports all around her. It went all over the house with us, always within reach, and on every trip we took. On one trip, it accidentally go left behind and when I realized it was missing as we got on the airplane, I nearly cried. We had to go buy a replacement on the way home from the airport, as I could not stand to go another hour without my boppy! The boppy and the covers washed well. I would highly recommend buying two covers so you always have one ready when the other is in the wash due to spit-up etc (which, trust me, happens regularly). I have bought several for gifts and recommend this product whole-heartedly!"
39214,1,"First let me say that the pictures on Amazon's site are not very good at showing the true colors of this set. Mine appears a lot more pink (the flowers) and the sage is a lot deeper (like licheny-moss) and more green than the pictures show. It does also have a vintage tea-stained look to it. It is NOT fru-fru baby, but a more subtle shabby chic baby style.I also can tell you that the floral fabric is a decorator weight cotton. That means it is suitable for both drapery and upholstery projects. It is NOT a cushy-t-shirt feel, but rather a durable (almost canvas feel).All of that being said, I must include that I love this set. I bought it before Wendy made it exclusively for Babies-r-us; and I have shopped for matching pieces ever since. The quality is good, and the prices offered here are excellent (compared to independant designer prices). I have washed and dried the whole set repeatedly, and have found it to be well made. The ties for the bumper are extra wide, and aren't as apt to come loose as the little ribbon-type. I did notice wrinkling when I first bought it, but upon washing and drying, I had no problems (I put it on the crib promptly after drying each time).If you can see it in person before buying it, I recommend that you do so. I have been very pleased with the set, and have previously purchased additional pieces elsewhere- to decorate my oldest daughter's room. It is my opinion that this collection (the flowers, velvet, leopard, etc) would even look good in an adult's room. I would recommend this set."
129359,0,"I heard so many great things about this product in reviews from Amazon to just about every parenting magazine out there. It's a great developmental toy (useful for two-handed play and hand/eye coordination) it fits tiny hands, it rattles, it's a good teether, it provides distraction, and it's easy to clean. So of course it was high on my list of toys to buy for her last holiday season.However, while I believe it helped my daughter with some of her developmental milestones, I feel other less pricey toys helped her more. Likewise this toy had its moments where I was glad to have it for teething but my daughter seemed to find the small tubes frustrating and less satisfying than a thicker teether. The Winkel was a helpful distraction but only for a very limited period of time; once she started throwing it, she never stopped and refused to play with it again.I'd probably buy it again because it ticked so many boxes in the few months (about age 3-6mo) that my daughter had any interest in this toy, but that may also be because I still really want to like it more than I do and I like saying the word ""Winkel."""
126140,1,"I have used Huggies for all of my children for years - both for boys and girls! Excellent leak protection and are not scented like other diapers (Pampers, Luvs). There are enough smells that go along with having children, who needs another one coming from the diapers?! If they begin leaking consistently, then you need to go up a size. I never use them all the way up to the recommended weight, we usually switch at 2-3 lbs. less than the weight on the package. Keep in mind some diapers will NEVER hold certain ""loads."" Just part of life... Don't forget to join [...] for free stuff or to donate diapers to those less fortunate. Oh, and Amazon is great with the free 2 day delivery - can't beat the price and delivery speed!!! Thanks Amazon!"
165689,1,"Even though the skin stays dry, these diapers saturate pretty quickly and leak if not changed soon after the baby wets them. I have a few Swaddlers size 2 left and save them for the night, when baby usually has two bottles and use these Baby-Dry during the day only, when I can change him after he wets himself once. Also, the sizes seem to be smaller: at 16 lbs he's quickly outgrowing them.If you buy them on sale (for about 19 or 20 cents a diaper, they are a good buy, at full price they're not)."
173769,1,"When I was registering for gifts, I saw this swing and fell in love with it even though I was a bit hesitant about the cost - it is definitely on the higher end of the price category. My daughter has loved it from the start. First she really liked the side-to-side motion and was lulled to sleep almost immediately after we strapped her in. Now that she's four months old, she prefers the front-to-back motion and is either entertained enough to stay quiet or, if she's tired, she quickly drifts off while watching the mobile and listening to music or nature sounds. She even naps in it for several hours at a time. I highly recommend this item!"
23909,1,"My son is 9 weeks old, and has been using the SleepSack for about 2 weeks. Prior to that, I've swaddled him in blankets and in theSwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap-Blue Cotton Knit. Blankets came apart easily, and the SwaddleMe worked for a few weeks, then became very easy for him to wriggle out of (not to mention that even though he was well within the recommended size for the product, it ran small very quickly). His sleep benefits from swaddling but I wasn't able to find something that got a good grip on him and also stayed in place comfortably. Once I put him in a SleepSack, he started sleeping longer at night - he's now up to a 6 hour uninterrupted stretch - a huge leap from his 2 1/2 hours-at-a-time routine.I like that the SleepSack is somewhat versatile in how you wrap baby - it can wrap his arms, or just his torso. I didn't think that the torso-only wrap would make a difference, but on nights where he absolutely won't tolerate having his arms wrapped, he has still slept very well. My only complaint is that I'd like the swaddle wings to be removable, for when I want to use it as solely a sleep blanket.The velcro is also pretty loud when you open the swaddle, which can wake baby, but I'm not sure that's something you can avoid."
36223,1,This carrier is wonderful! I had a BabyBjorn before but that gave me back pain after 4 months. Lite-on-Shoulder came to my rescue. Although it has a learning curve in the beginning I feel my baby is completely secure in it. I started using it when my baby was about 4 months old and it never fails that she falls asleep in it. She is now 22 lbs and still loves the snuggle comfort of it. it allows me to adjust the height precisly that I can let her straddle on my hip to even part of her weight onto my hip and alleviate the shoulder load. The pouch shape design add double security to it.
75352,1,"This compares well with the medela pump in style, especially at the price. It pumps just as well but has a few quirks: 1) it's a little louder (with a syncopated beep, for that '80s drum kit feel), possibly because it doesn't have the casing of the bag, 2) the collection bottles take 4 ounces rather than 5, so you might need to change them more frequently when pumping, 3) the bottle/pump parts are a little more fiddly to put together and keep track of when you're sterilizing, re-assembling, storing everything. Frankly, none of these seemed too big a deal--certainly not worth the price difference. Some advantages: 1) it's a lot cheaper and pumps just as well; 2) you can pick your own bag for it, instead of the hi-i'm-a-discreetly-packaged-breast-pump bags that the medela comes in; 3)since it's not packaged up in a bag, it's actually more portable."
93710,1,The listing doesn't specify that 6 do come in a package. YEA! They work wonders when you are storing your breastmilk right from pump to bottle. It has a tight seal to prevent any milk spilling and you can just add the nipple when ready to use for feeding. A must have for breastfeeding moms.
42063,1,"This teether is great-I really like the colors, appropriate for girl or boy. It's easy to take places (doesn't make a scene if Baby drops it in church) and is easy for baby to grasp. Also very easy to clean."
142694,1,"~*When I recieved the product the zipper needed a little tweaking, but i fixed the problem; just had to unzip all the way and then re-zip back down. To add to that, the button on the back where it snaps closed over the handle bars completely broke off! now i have to take to the cleaners. would have gotten 5 stars without the button breaking and zipper tweaking. overall very useful and luxurious! i absolutely love it and would recommend!*~"
124587,2,"The Easy-To-Clean aspirator does not muster up enough suction to effectively remove nasal congestion. Additionally, the tip is not big enough to create a good vacuum. I suggest the Luv N' Care Nuby Nasal Aspirator for sale at Walgreens."
78990,1,We wanted to buy something on which we could possibly dry baby bottles and nipple's along with other accessories such as rings and pacifiers. I would say Dr. Browns Drying rack does that all.. and is indeed very effective in terms of drying things fast as the air circulates through the bottles which dries them faster. I would suggest Dr brown to include a tray to dispose of water from the drying racks.
102859,2,"Bought this hoping to save $ on refills. Twisting mechanism doesn't really work, spring that keeps mouth closed keeps popping off. And once our baby started solid food, the gig was up - doesn't contain the odor of truly stinky diapers. Just upgraded to the Diaper Genie (which now has extra-thick bags for babies on solid food)."
172574,2,This shower is not worth the money. My first time using it and the shower part never worked. The tub part is good but there's no use buying it just for the tub part.
137472,1,"These are cool. Bought one for each of my kids and they love them. Makes bedtime more fun and the stars really do look neat on the ceiling n walls. There's 3 buttons to change the colors, pink, yellow and both."
85754,1,"I used these for our nursery which we are getting ready for our little one. It has 3 images of the Guess how much I love you characters in a sequence and are already prepasted. They are easy to paste, remove instantly and then repaste them over again.I hope they stay put for a long time. They look nice with a yellowish background but I guess green would work as well....We were happy we could get this."
3285,1,"These swaddleMe's are a great invention. My, now 5 month old, had terrible colic starting at about 5 weeks old. We used these, swaddleme's, to help soothe her and they helped us a TON. We would first swaddle her in a receiving blanket, as directed by Dr. Karp, and then use this swaddleMe as added security. I highly recommend swaddling little ones, it saved us a lot of heart aches."
65005,0,"I bought this stroller because of the Britax name and of course because I had the Companion carseat first. I am a little disapointed with both but not totally.1.Carseat--it seems to be the only stroller compatible with the Britax Companion carseat which is why I purchased it.2. Price--wouldn't pay as much as it's listed for. Got it for $1003. Looks--upholstery attractive.4. Handlebar--The handlebar is height-adjustable and easy to use/steer.5. Storage--the basket is as large and accessible as any I've encountered, and it comes with a small zip-on bag with a shoulder strap, which I find just big enough to carry wallet, phone and changing supplies. Just wish is had the cup holder because if you put a drink in the bag it moves the canopy.6. Brake-easy to engage/disengage with one foot.7. Snack tray--it comes with a detachable child snack tray with cupholder which was priceless for my daughter.8. View window-a velcro-fastened flap allows one to peek at baby when the sun canopy is up.Cons:1. FOLDING--this is the dealbreaker for most. It is very difficult to fold, unless one has three hands. You need two hands to release the locks on either side, plus another to release the seatback, which must be held and folded all the way down. Plus you have to use your entire body to push it down. I was traveling alone with my daughter and this was a HUGE pain and I have to buy another stroller just because of this.2. Recline mechanism--it frequently sticks, adding to the difficulty of folding the stroller and doesn't have anough positions, either too reclined or straight up and down...my daughter would get frustrated.3. Squeak--mine did but I just used WD-40 and it has been fine for over 6 months.4. Size--it doesn't fold very compactly compared with other strollers in its class.6. Sun canopy-I have this complaint with almost every stroller--it's only adequate if you're walking away from the sun. Why can't stroller manufacturers get this one right? So I purchased a shade extender.This isn't a bad stroller but it has it's drawbacks. I'm not sure what I'd do next time. My daugher hated the stroller until she was old enough to be in a jogger anyway but not every baby is like that. With my situation I would definately just get a jogger instead. I will keep this system for my next child but I'm anxious to buy a jogger."
3124,1,There is a stage with my babies during the wiggle stage but at the same time they still liked to be swaddled. This was perfect and my kids loved it. Diaper changing was a lot easier and faster and it kept them cozy:) gr8 buy worth trying!
53970,2,"We bought this and took it home. Once we had the batteries in, we could not get it to make a connection when we closed the battery compartment. We took it back and got another only to be unable to make a connection with that one at all. The compartment seems to give to much lateral room to the batteries to make a solid connection."
104306,1,"Recieved the gate about a week ago, installation was a little bit harder then expected since the directions were not very clear, but then again I am no handy man. Gate works great it keeps my little ninja in his room at night since he likes to run around at night and tear stuff up. Would purchase another one if needed."
64550,1,"Keeps your pets where you want them and out of where you don't. Well constructed. If you need a pet gate for a small to average dog, this will be a good choice. I have three of these gates."
54039,0,It was recommended to put my infant seat in the middle which doesn't work with the mirror (at least with a sport utility vehicle). Now my baby is over 20 lbs. and I moved him to the side so I can use my mirror.
57800,2,"I thought this product was a great idea. But each time I would wipe my childs bottom she would cry, the wipes were only warm in the container, the moment I took it out to use, it was cold. Great idea, horrible product."
2755,0,"I got a sample pack of a few of these in the mail. I tried them out on my son. They worked great and I loved the easy clean up. I checked them out at the store, but as much as I love them, I couldn't justify the price. I did by a box, but use them strictly for when we eat away from home. I also bought a five pack of plastic bibs and I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher and they come out clean. These are a good idea, but too expensive for everyday use."
118106,1,"We just bought this bed for our 2 year old. He LOVES IT! He is so proud of it. The bed was easy to put together and seems to be of excellent quality. I really like that I can use the crib mattress now and a twin later on. It is low to the ground so my son has no problems getting in and out of it.I ordered the bed through the Step 2 website. It is $250 there but the shipping is only $69 and there was no tax. So, that was the cheapest option for us.I highly recommend this bed!"
83285,1,"I have been using this car seat for about 3.5 months for my daughter. Overall I am really happy with it and she is too - she sleeps very well in it and for hours at a time whether in the car or out for a walk in the stroller.As most people know it's really easy to click the seat into the base or stroller and equally easy to remove it. The seat does get pretty heavy with a 14+ pound child in it but I don't really see any way around that and definitely prefer being able to tote her around in it - I can't imagine strapping her into the car each time we get in. It'd be very difficult to do with a newborn.I had some trouble figuring out how to permanently extend the straps once she started to grow, there's a flat plastic piece in the back you have to remove and then take the straps off the metal hook and put them back on using the other set of loops (this will make sense if looking at the seat).When you are using the seat, it's important to make sure the straps are snug around the infant. There is a metal piece that holds the excess length of the shoulder straps in place and you need to loosen it to get the baby in easily. You have to reach down into the hole the ""tail"" comes out of and push the metal piece down while pulling on the straps to loosen them temporarily - you then use the strap to tighten the shoulder straps once the child is buckled in (making sure the straps are on their shoulders which is not easy when they are so little).I also get a lot of compliments on the pattern and think it's appropriate for a boy or a girl. I don't use the leg cover that came with the car seat. It's Winter in Philly so a Bundle Me is a must...good luck!"
177941,2,"The nice steady drip makes it an excellent replacement for an Aqua Globe. Keeps my plants watered while on vacation, and I don't have to worry about washing all 5 pieces and bending my thumbnail pushing it back together any more."
90151,1,papers would have been great but the wrong size. They were automatically sent and by the time I received them my son out grew them.
32827,1,"This is by far the best carrier on the market, and we've tried several. My daughter loves being in it - we go everywhere with it. I love the fact that it is so sturdy and easy to use. My mind is at ease knowing that she is safe and secure. Other brands that we've tried never felt very durable to me. The Bjorn distributes the weight evenly (more so than the others). This is definitely a must have item for new parents! We also bought the XL straps for my husband. He doesn't use them nearly as much as I do, but it's still comforting to know that if we ever needed him to ""Bjorn"" her, we'd have the extra straps."
24308,1,"I'm glad I didn't listen to those reviewers that claim the sheet is scratchy or hard to wash.The sheet is sturdy which I appreciate when baby's diaper leaks. Its true its not the softest sheet but it is fine and after using it for 3 months it does soften in the wash over time. It has Velcro strips along the sides that attach to the mattress so As for washing what has worked for me is simply: take the sheet off and stick the Velcro strips together then for added security from it attaching itself to the other clothes in the washer i throw it into my lingerie/hosiery net bag. For drying I just hang it doesn't take long to dry at all, and p.s. there been more than a few times it has accidentally landed in my dryer and the sheet still fits."
34535,1,"I didn't want a super huge garbage can in the baby's room for our cloth diapers so I decided to give this a try in hopes that it wouldn't be too small...It's perfect! It comes up to just below my knee and is very discreet and works great for our purpose of cloth diapering. It may seem small compared to specific cloth diaper pails, but it encourages me to keep up on laundry more often and doesn't take up a ton of space, which I like. The Planet Wise Diaper Pail Liner fits like a glove in this pail which was an added bonus!"
148943,1,The pillow over all is great. I've had it now for about a month and I can sleep MUCH better. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I though it was TOO soft and not enough cushion. A little too thin for my taste. I have to use an extra pillow at the head or else I feel like I am upside down. But over all great product! Definetely worth the money.
19008,2,"We got it on clearance at Walmart, so I guess I can't complain too much. But now we can't sell it either and it's pretty much a waste. First time we used it the back wheel brake broke off. There's no tray on the back, which stinks for your second child. Difficult to steer, just not impressing overall."
93466,2,"I bought this potty for my 18 month old when he started saying ""Potty"" everytime one of us went to the bathroom. First time he sat on it, he caught his little boy parts on the splash guard. I guess it hurt him enough to scare him because he will not sit on it anymore. It was too big for him to sit on by himself, so I would have to lift him onto it to avoid him getting caught on the splash guard. He has learned to pull the guard off now, but still will not sit on it without clothes on. I would not recommend this one at all."
76089,1,"I read many reviews on products for storing baby food and decided on these for the price and lid. I make a batch of cubes and store them in gallon zip lock bags, so I wasn't looking for anything for long term storage. This definitely serves the purpose. I read several reviews complaining about the serving size per cube. The package states that each cube is 1 oz which is correct. Of course, you can fill them however much you would like, but I fill mine full and it is 1 oz (2 tbsp) per cube.I read several reviews about warped lids and I unfortunately got one of them. It doesn't seal over one of my trays, however I have not found it to be a huge problem as I only leave the food in the trays long enough for them to freeze and the lid serves the purpose of keeping it covered to avoid contamination.Also, those that reviewed about it being hard to get the food out... the first couple times I popped the cubes out, it was a little challenging, but it has gotten easier over time."
55375,2,"I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that car seat protection mats are not approved and considered a major safety hazard because it causes the car seat to become loose. If you use these mats, the car seat will not be installed tightly enough and can be a real danger during automobile accidents. DON'T BUY!!"
138612,0,"This product is fantastic except for a few things:1. The batteries get eaten up quickly, especially if it's used as a nightlight. The batteries ran out half way through the night and I was not going to put fresh ones in each night!2. The buttons are flimsy. One of ours broke off when the turtle was being played with.So, if you want to have a planetarium on your kids' ceiling at night for a few minutes, it's great. If you want to use it as a nightlight, it's not great."
84814,0,"I'm only giving this product an ""ok"" review as I don't think it's totally awful. I just want to warn other short people may not be able to easily use this product as a taller person. The door lock sits on top of the door and if you are short and if you live in a newer house with taller doors, you will find that you have to pull a stool up each and every time to open and close the door. Not good."
3674,2,"If I could give this idiotic contraption 0 stars I would. There is no good way to attach it so it never adequately shields the baby. What's more, it topples over onto baby if you so much as breath on it, making it not only useless but dangerous."
25035,2,"At first I praised this gate too. I purchased this gate from this company (the first years top of the stair gate) for the first time just about 2 years ago when my daughter was just learning to crawl. But take it from someone who is very dissatisfied with the way I was treated like a number and pushed aside when I told the company that the hardware in the gate was not durable and after about the first 7-8 months of use the gate broke down. I needed this gate for the top of the stairs in a split level ranch home where there is no door blocking the stairs, and the main level of my home is the second floor. I told the company and they automatically sent me a replacement gate at no charge. I was happy once again because this gate was exactly what we had hoped it would be. Another 6-8 months passed and once again the hardware broke down again. Now expecting our second child and continuing to need the gate at the top of the stairs, I called once again to report the mechanical problem. I was basically told that it was our fault the gate had broken for the second time and that it was ridiculous that I was asking for a second replacement. After much hassle they finally sent me another gate but they stressed they were marking it in my record that WHEN the gate broke down again I was not to receive anymore replacements. I even spoke with a manager whom basically told me the same thing, It was our fault the gate had broken and that the gate was in a high traffic zone in my home and that is why it had broken down twice/???????????????????. I Ask anyone who is a consumer out there, ""Should that mater?"" You need it especially to work in a high traffic area where there are stairs! Wouldn't you expect it to work at least until your children are preschool age and able to steadily navigate stairs. Oh I didn't mention the hyper Brittany spaniel that is our pet. Even though our daughter Sam is now steady on her feet I worry that when the UPS guy rings the doorbell and my dog goes ballistic that she may accidentally knock Sam down the stairs. The company told me to break the hardware on the gate to get it to work. This was impossible. Listen I don't like to complain I think they make things cheap these days and the only thing that matters is the money to the company. I will not buy another gate from this company again. The least the company could have done is refund my money so that I could buy a different gate. You know I was happy at the time they were sending me the second gate but after the whirl wind conversation I had I guess I was feeling just a little dumbfounded. But you know what! WHEN the gate breaks down again I will call them again and complain. This time prepared for what they will dish out and if they refuse again to send me a replacement for their faulty product I will report them to the better business bureau. Buyer beware."
137720,1,"I can't rave about this night light enough. I have a 2 year old son that absolutely LOVES this thing. Its nice to have options with light color, although my son really likes the blue settings.Sometimes our son needs a little motivation to get him to WANT to put on his PJs and start winding down, and this little turtle is the perfect thing to do it. He gets so excited to turn it on every night, bedtime has become SO much easier!If you are looking for a nighlight, look no further. Definitely worth every penny!"
173805,2,"My son loves this swing. I did too, until it stopped swinging. I changed the batteries thinking that was the problem. I took my son out of the swing and turned it on and it worked fine. So I took it back to the store and got another one. Now, it is doing the same thing. My son is 15lbs. The swing says it holds 25lbs. I plan on calling the manufactuer. I wish it worked properly!!!Before it stopped swinging it was a great swing. I love that it can cradle him or swing him."
102516,1,I chose this mobile to go with frog themed nursery. I love the sounds that it has with it. The nature sound is my sons favorite sound to sleep to. It is on the quite side and you cannot hear the motors at all.I've had it running for a week and love it. The remote works great also so you don't have to walk beside the crib and risk waking the baby.You might need some help putting it together it's not hard to assemble but it's easier to have help.
32889,2,"I Like the Carriers that give the head support. When the baby falls asleep he/or she will have some kind of head &amp; neck support. So you would want to look for a carrier with that High back, neck &amp; head support. I used one for all 3 of my kids."
45269,1,"I love everything about this mat! My three month old has been playing on this activity mat for the past month and LOVES it. He can lay on his back and stare at the toys for hours, and he often even falls asleep there after he exhausts himself batting at the toys and delightedly squealing. He seems to love all the toys equally, so he turns his head back and forth a lot, which is great for rounding out the little flattened area on the back of his skull that he developed from always laying on his back. The music mat is fantastic and since his feet are currently moving with more force than his hands, I usually lay him with his feet over the sensor so it plays music when he kicks around. He spits up a fair amount, so I have had to wash the play mat twice, which is super easy to do, even in my tiny old washing machine. It dries really fast too!"
75095,0,"I looked everywhere for a big diaper bag that looked nice. I thought that I had found the one. I loved it when I got it in the mail and could not wait to use it, it was not even a month of use and the zipper broke and then the sides starting coming apart. If i had to do it over again I would not spend 70 on something that is going to fall apart!"
32851,1,"This is the greatest product for a new mom- and a must have if you have a baby and a toddler. Keeps your hands free to do whatever- food shop, run in a store to pick something up quick, etc. Comfortable and easy to use. Once I used mine a couple of times I found myself preferring it to my gorgeous expensive stroller because my daughter was happier attached to me and I didn't have to worry about her falling out the supermarket shopping cart or getting bored and fussy in her stroller. Face them toward you before they can hold thier head up well and out after. Amazing & so comfortable- I LOVE MINE & couldn't live without it!!!!!"
79021,2,"If I had paid 2 dollars for this, I wouldn't bother to complain.As reviewed by others, it is indeed correct that it's poorly designed : too flimsy for Dr Brown's own 8oz glass bottles!! The bottles on the picture must be a light plastic model (if it's not a computer-generated rendition), be warned: you won't be able to do that with glass bottles.And the bottom section of the rack? impossible to reach anything underneath.A cheaper substitute: your regular dish rack."
34094,2,"Put the carseat in the bag tonight, and the zipper won't stay ""together"" when I zip it up around the seat. Terrible quality on the zipper - cheap plastic. We read all of the rave reviews, now here we are leaving tomorrow for the airport and this bag is so cheap, we can't even get the bag to the airport. Yes, we should have inspected upon receipt but it's something you don't know until you uninstall the carseat from your car and try to zip up. What parent of a toddler really has time to do this? You buy something and expect it to work. I would recommend others to buy another brand."
10425,1,"My 2-year-old is a little scared of new things. So, you can imagine how hard it is to get him to try an adult size toilet in a public restroom.We used theBaby Bjorn Potty Chair(great product, as well!) to get him started . He figured out the routine within 3 days, but when I had to travel with him, he refused to use other potties or any toilet seat covers (padded or folded). If I was lucky enough to get him to sit on the other seats, they would move or the pee guard didn't seem high enough, so my toddler and I would be nervous about him sitting on there for long. I had to take the potty seat with me everywhere I went... to family members' houses, to parties, and to the grocery store. I was sneaking my son out to my car every time he had to pee. And when we finally decided to go without the potty seat while we were entertaining friends in downtown Chicago, my son was more comfortable peeing in his pants than any toilet in CHI-town.Then I bought the Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and no more potty in the trunk. It fits into the diaper bag and since it's adjustable, it fits all toilets securely. When my son sits on it, he can change positions as many times as he wants and he doesn't feel like he's going to fall in. I think it really helps that it is white like the toilet as well. He gets such a satisfied look on his face when he pees on the BIG toilet."
59951,1,This bathtub is awesome. Our son outgrew his first bathtub at 4 months old and we desperately needed something bigger that would hold him until he was able to sit up on his own. The design of this bathtub is the best I've ever seen and should last us a long time. He loves being in his tub and looks forward to bathtime every night! I highly recommend this product...I wish we would have gotten this one from the start.
145110,1,"Bought this for my son when he was about 4.5-5 months old. He absolutely loved jumping in it. Now that he is 6 months he is super interested in the toys. We both love the tethered teeter. It is perfect for him to chew on and I'm not always running to pick it up off the floor and having to wash it off. He is also a big fan of the lights and the spinning lizard rattle. At first I thought the hanging frog and parrot were kind of useless but he loves to look at them and jumps to try to reach them.I love this toy because it was fairly simple to put together because everything just snaps into place. It is not too bulky for the living room and it seems pretty sturdy and looks adorable. Only downsides so far have been that even on the lowest setting we had to put a pillow underneath it so that my son could actually make contact with the floor enabling him to jump and spin; he is now about 27"" and is the perfect height for the lowest setting. Also, while it folds down for storage or travel, it is still pretty big. It has been easier for us to just leave it set up most of the time because folding it down is kind of a hassle and it is really too big to travel with in my hatchback. Other than that we love it. And as always, Amazon shipped in a timely manner, it arrived when expected and in perfect condition."
84901,0,"My son was able to get out of the seat very easily. He had only been in the seat one time before the time he wiggled his way out.But the seat was very easy to install, the box for storage & carrying is a great idea. The seat is soft (especially to be a booster) and I loved that I could wash the cover.Unfortunately thanks to the wiggle worm I had to return the seat."
173189,0,"I bought this product hoping that I could keep my son's feet marks off the seat back when he's rear-facing. I know the directions say to use the bottom piece only when rear-facing, but I thought, ""Why not try the top piece too?"" Well the top piece won't stay on the back of the seat and doesn't cover a very big area. If the designers had only made the top piece a bit bigger and put some kid of strap or loop on the top, this product would be great for rear-facing. As it is, all it does is keep the car seat dents out of the bottom of the seat for rear-facing and bottom and back for front-facing. It is also a bit thinner than I expected. It will probably keep dents out of your seats, but don't expect it to keep the seats clean."
47807,1,"Great product! Love the natural ingredients, and we haven't experienced any problems with diaper rash or other irritation to baby's skin. I would highly recommend it!"
8032,1,"Great material. I washed twice and not change coler at all.Diferent the one I got from Baby ""R"" Us, that fade in the first wash."
51127,0,"This body pillow is not nearly as comfortable as my past body pillow, which was the Comfort-U (which I highly recommend!). It's too stiff, although I'm sure it'll soften over time. The stitching in the curves is too tight and therefore not flexible enough. The fabric is a little rough too. I was expecting a much more comfortable pillow and am now regretting I didn't stick with the Comfort-U, which is a little bigger and bulkier, but you feel surrounded by a cloud and it's so much more comfortable."
40397,0,"I decided to try this product since my daughter just started crawling; I had been using the Pampers Baby Dry diapers. I like the Baby Dry product very much so I was thinking this would be a step up since they are more expensive and ""made for mobile babies"" but, alas, it is not so. They leave little white debris on my daughter's butt and the gel they use for absorbency gives her a rash.I like the Baby Dry and I have already purchased a box of these for when she runs out of the Cruisers."
63444,1,"My son loved this toy, I don't know what I would have done without it for the first year"
67519,1,"These are very absorbant, they have pretty Princess designs, they have the 3 stars that disappear when wet, and easy open velcro sides which are great in times of accidents. I only gave it a 4 star because they leave a gel like substance if left on overnight. I would suggest using these during the day, and stick with the pampers at night.God bless!"
128285,1,"I like this product for a few reasons: 1. it folds up easily so I can bring it anywhere; 2. it cleans up in a jiffy; 3. my kids like the graphics but that wasn't as important as was the fact that it actually helped ease their anxiety when using a public toilet. I agree that it MIGHT have a nasty tendancy to pinch skin IF your little one moves around a lot on top of it, BUT, I never leave my child unattended on the seat and let's face it, these aren't meant to replace a real toilet or even a more traditional potty seat, it's just for travel and in an emergency when you hate the thought of putting yourself in a public toilet with your kids, this will save the day. Just make sure you position it correctly towards the front of the toilet set, there are rubberized pieces underneath to help keep it snug. If you plan to use this all the time for potty training, I'd go with something more secure, but for compact, light portability this is the best bet. Also, the bulkier travel seats with padded tops are not as sanitary and if you rip a corner of the seat, it's pretty much useless since water will get inside the foam."
142459,0,Though serving its purpose it broke early a clock so the flipping down and sliding under the matress is not functional anymore. My son crawls out of the bed at the foot of the bed.Shipping was quick and packaging was good.
14853,0,"I originally bought these bottles because I planned on breastfeeding and using these to hold pumped breast milk. I ended up choosing to bottle feed. These bottles are good but I did find that they had a leaking problem. I went on the web site and after reading the other reviews, I figured out how to correct that. I also had a problem with the formula leaking out of my sons mouth while he was feeding. He would loose 1-2 ounces of formula this way. I just figured out why... The baby has to latch on just as if he was latching onto a breast. The lips must be flanged out. This keeps the formula from dripping out of the mouth. Hope this is helpful to anyone else who had the same problem!"
171049,1,"Love the design, number of pages, & quality of this book. Cloth book much nicer than the all plastic one my older granddaughter had, but certainly wish it came in a different color. The black & white edging is great, but really don't like the white color of the book. Red perhaps?"
109228,0,The product arrived and I was pleasantly surprised that it was a much lighter baby blue. Fits as expected on the deluxe pillow.
101758,1,"I have the Phil & Teds Pink Camo and this bag, the Pink Camo Hop Skip Pannier Bags (I have two of these) is perfect to attach to the side of the pram instead of the grey/black ones made by Phil & Teds. They fit in so much better. At the moment in just one bag I have 2 nappies, wipes, change matt, bib, my pocket diary and there is still room for a bottle and formula container...which is what I usually have in it. And for a tight squeeze I can also put my wallet on the top, before doing up the clips. The side pocket is perfect for my mobile so I don't have to unclip and hunt for it while its ringing.So overall I highly recommend this product...its so slim on a P&T; pram, so much so I can still fit thru the slim checkouts with two bags attached."
183317,0,"ROCKINGAfter a month of using it, we finally put the wheels up and used the rocking function. We were worried one of the older brothers would rock it over, but it will not tip, due to it's...WIDE BASEWe love the height of our bassinet, but to stabilize it, they had to make the base so wide that it doesn't fit through our bedroom doorway.WHEELSThe wheels are extremely cheap and don't roll well (when they do) on the hardwood and don't roll at all on the rugs.SOUNDS/VIBRATIONWe like that there is a +/- for volume and vibration. The music sound is a bit cheezy, but we like the rain sound for a little white noise.One extra word of warning, my mom bought us a fitted mattress pad that said it could be used with this bassinet, but the sheet won't fit over it and it doesn't have holes cut out for the buckles. Check before buying a sheet for this if you will be using the buckle!"
156110,0,This teether is nice but we haven't used it as we don't have children. I believe it would be good as I have taken care of many children and seen these kinds of teethers before. It's also gender neutral (which is what we are going for right now).
157368,2,If I had to do it over again I would not purchase this item. Almost every piece of the changing table had a flaw in it. There were corners broken off and there were nicks all over it. On top of that it is not white. They should describe it as ivory. We had to repair and paint ours in order to be able to use it. Not happy!
84479,1,"Ordered swing for our new play set in the back yard. Got it two days later, and our child loves it. It's easy to install, and easy to use. The straps are nice and secure, and I feel comfortable pushing my 2-year old as high as he likes to go. But, I'd also use it on a smaller child. Inexpensive, and a good value."
3223,0,"My wife and I have used the Swaddle Me blanket as well as its main competitor, the Miracle Blanket.The pros of the Swaddle Me are: it's cheaper than the Miracle Blanket, and it's less fiddly to get the baby in. This is much appreciated when you're sleep deprived, and it also makes it less likely that you'll wake up an already-sleeping baby when you put her in.But there are tradeoffs that come with this extra convenience. The Swaddle Me is much less snug; it leaves the baby's arms free to wriggle around, and as our baby got older, we found her arms were slipping out more and more, resulting in a less effective swaddle.Most disconcertingly, when her arms got strong enough, she was able to slip one wing of the blanket up over her shoulder, where it ended up pulled around her neck by the velcro fastening! As you can imagine, this gave us a moment of sheer parental terror. Fortunately, there was no harm done; the pressure was on her shoulder rather than her windpipe. But the incident was enough to make us stop using the Swaddle Me immediately, and switch to the Miracle Blanket.I'm still giving the Swaddle Me 3 stars, because it did a great job in the first two months or so. And since I couldn't find any reports of a Swaddle Me actually harming a baby (and it didn't actually harm mine), I have to assume that it's perfectly safe, no matter how scary it looked when it slipped up around the shoulder and neck area.Still, on the balance, I think it's paying a little extra for the Miracle Blanket, and taking a little extra time to get the hang of it. You'll get a more effective swaddle longer--and you won't have to worry about it slipping."
182654,1,"it seemed like a hefty price for storage on a stroller so i didnt buy one for over 4 months since having gotten the stroller. however i saw someone with one at disneyland and i was surprised to see how big it was and how much this person had stuffed in it. i came home and ordered one immediately and its really great. it holds way more than any other cup holder/storage thing on any stroller ive ever seen and it makes going on long outings more managable. i highly recommend it. i can put two gatorades, my keys, phone, like 4 snacks, wallet, all my husbands stuff, and have room to spare. its SO conveinent."
46104,1,This is the best purchase we made for our newborn. She loves it and engages with it/talks to it more than any other toy or object in the house. Highly recommended.
168948,1,"I was first given these diapers at my baby shower and my friend said ""Your going to love these!"" Boy was she right. The diapers have never broke out my daughter's sensitive skin and the blanket-feel make sures there are no leaks and messes. I tried another brand one time when the store ran out of Pampers and never again. They just didn't feel right and were bulky on her. Plus you can't beat this price with a baseball bat. The cheapest that I have found is $17.47 for 88 diapers and here you get 218 for $36 bucks! Also my local stores do not carry any size past one; at Amazon I found all of the sizes for the same great price. Needless to say I am a fan!! My friend is pregnant and lives out of the country; when I visit her I am definetly taken a box with me. Only complaint I have is that they should make them in more designs; Sesame street is getting old."
59234,0,"It does it's job. It does warm bottles quickly and the variable temperature is a great feature, but I, as well as everyone else I know who own one, have overflowed this model repeatedly. Who needs another thing to clean up when you have a little one around? There are warmers that have specific compartments for warming jars of baby food, this one doesn't work well for jars, but then again, my son doesn't really like his food warmed up. It's an O.K. model to have."
127316,2,"I can't actually comment on the assembled crib itself since there were multiple pieces missing from the box and I'm still waiting for all of the pieces to arrive. Several weeks ago I started assembling the crib and found that the lock washers were not included in the package. I wrote the company and they sent lock washers which arrived a couple of weeks later. Once they arrived, I again tried to assemble to crib, only to find that the mounting brackets were missing. I guess I should have checked to make sure all of the parts were there when I first discovered the lock washers were missing, but I assumed the chances that multiple items would be missing were zero. I won't buy from this company again."
74503,1,"This seat adapter looks good and works to keep baby snug angd upright. Cleans up well works to make feeding easier. Just wish it was anchored to the chair as it can move down a little bit while sitting the baby in the chair. Overall this extends our usage of the chair so we could start using it at 5 months, and he loves sitting up with us."
21418,1,My 3 year old loves it as much as I do. Now she jumps on the trampoline and not the couch. She can bounch on it for so long and doesn't want to stop. And it helps her burn off energy. It is a bit hard to put together. But it is so worth it. I highly suggest anyone getting this. Go for it. It IS worth the money.
126040,1,Ive always used huggies brand and love them. Theyve always kept my son dry and we have never had any problema with them.
123097,1,This playyard is spacious and entertaining to my 10 month old. I would buy it again.
157708,1,My husband and I attached this to our daughters bassinet and she loves it. Since she has now outgrown the bassinet we plan on using it on her car seat.This product would be really great if the music played a lot longer.
110130,1,"We used this until our son didn't fit in it any longer. Great for using in rooms without baby gear. Just follow the instructions and don't pick up baby in it with the handles, carry it from the bottom, the handles are more decorative than functional. We use to sit this on the couch between us and loved it. Our son has asthma and reflux so we felt better with him near for awhile and this was just great. Sturdy enough we're passing it on to another family, still looked like new after 6 months of daily use."
37078,0,Our son is 36 months and weighs 30 lbs. We chose this car seat because it reclines and has moveable arm rests. After using it for a month I can say my son loves it.He looks very comfortable and he can cross his legs. He has been a much better traveler since he's used it. It does sit up too high for our Ford Expedition which has high seats. I could not see out of the rear view mirrow so I had to move it out of the middle of the seat next to the door so I can see better. My son can undo the latches in a flash. I don't like this at all. The seat slips when in the reclining position.I plan to buy some non-slip material to put under it. We are using the latch side system not the seat belt. The straps twist and it is hard to pull the straps tight the way it is designed. I like the color it matches our interior. I like the easy adjustable back harness. It is easy to adjust for a different size child.
184626,1,"I bought this sheet in white before reading the reviews. I washed it in warm water, tumble dried it on low, and it fits perfectly. Either the unhappy reviewers have bigger mattresses (although I thought the size of crib mattresses was standard) or fit is related to the type of mattress pad. I have one that is padded only on the top surface, but not on the sides."
109484,0,"I just got this for my 5 month old and think its a great product. However, it is really hard to get it open so I can put something cold inside for his teething."
120288,1,Not to much to say about this toy it's a good teether pretty basic. My daughter loves dora and the pictures on the keys. The only thing I don't like is the little pictures are covered with a plastic and moisture tends to get between the plastic and the pictures. Other than that it's a great teether.
29990,1,"I bought it for my unborn baby boy, so far it perfectly fits the crib and the quality seems good for the price($22). the thread is 100, so don't expect it to be very soft, but it is 100% cotton."
62880,1,"This is one of the best gifts to receive! We love our Diaper Genie! If you can't figure out how to use it, you shouldn't have had a kid! It's easy and we don't have any poopie diaper smell! Yippeee! Highly recommend this product! Plus, Amazon.com has the refils online and they're cheaper than going to the store - plus it's shipped right to your door!"
172440,2,I bought this tub for my 6 month old because he had outgrown the baby tub. He loved being upright because he could play with his toys and splash the water. All of a sudden he starts screaming like something is hurting him. I pulled him up and noticed that the bar between his legs seperated and was pinching his privates!! I studied the seat a little more and noticed how horribly it is constructed. The middle seperates when you push down on the seat. DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT.
37846,1,"I put this on my registry and received it at my shower. I have been pretty pleased with it as well!*At first, I didn't think I'd need the thermometer because I also had an ear thermometer, but my child's pediatrician said they aren't accurate with newborns or infants, so I've gotten plenty of use out of it as an under-the-arm thermometer.*I didn't like the bulb syringe at all... it's not very flexible. I much prefer the one given to us at the hospital.*The nail clippers work great! I use them quite a bit since my son's nails grow so quickly. Some say to just tear the end of the nail off, but I'd hate to accidentally get it tearing into the nail bed! Ouch!*I won't use the medicine measurer anytime soon thanks to the little syringes the hospital gave me, but once he's bigger and takes larger doses of medicine, I'm sure they'll come in handy.*The brush is pretty soft, but his hair isn't long enough for the comb yet.I think it's a great set, but this is the only one I have and I haven't checked out any others. I'd definitely recommend it with the fact that you won't use everything at once in mind."
140473,1,"I was excited to get this product because it had an ac adaptor so i didnt have to use batteries all the time! The first time I plugged it in eveything was fine.The second time, the adaptor wouldnt work. I checked my outlets but they were fine. Im not sure if there is a short in the adaptor."
112410,1,"Best diaper ever, the shape is good and comfortable, very soft and adjusts comfortably."
168515,1,"With subscribe and save program and coupons and amazon mom, you can get this even cheaper than the store brands at costco or walmart.The only complaint I have is that Pampers still dont make these diapers biodegradable. I wish they do something to fix this major issue of trashing the planet."
41262,1,"Other less expensive brands used to work fine for my son. Now I find that that Pampers is the only brand that really fits his behind. We've had no leaks or blowouts when he wears them, even overnight."
101740,0,"I thought this would be slightly larger. Great bag and cute too! But, would be getter if it were larger and included a strap for over the shoulder."
76372,1,"I got this for my son...I loved it. It keeps him in place and because it is slightly inclined, I did not have to worry too much about spit ups. Once I burped him well and positioned him on his side or back, all went well..."
176192,1,I received this item as a shower gift and I love it. It includes everything you will need to give baby a bath. It even included a free type of bottle in which I had planned on purchasing that exact same one. This is a good gift......
111768,1,"This is a solid, easy to install gate that actually fit out 45"" wide stairs. My wife had it put up in minutes. It strong, easy to open and keeps the kids in. We ended up buying two and they're worth the purchase."
106757,1,"This is a great diaper disposer because you can use it with one hand (keeping one hand on your baby) and because you can use standard kitchen garbage bags (vs. the genie which requires it's own more expensive and tougher to find bags). My advice is to wrap each diaper as tightly as you can so you can fit more in, and change it when it's full vs. trying to fit one more diaper in and causing it to jam. I think this one holds the odor in as well as any of them, but let's face it, when the baby starts eating solid foods, it's going to stink no matter which diaper pail you use. Happy changing!"
92302,1,"My now 10 week old son refused to breast feed. Once I got over the rejection, I started looking for a better bottle than the disposable liner playtex as I had no intention of spending all my money on those stupid liners! At the same time, he was refusing every pacifier I could find. I knew he wanted one because all he wanted to do to calm himself down was suck on a finger, but after hours of wrinkly fingers, I was desperate for a pacifier. I came across the soothies and he instantly took the pacifier. I was so excited. I bought the bottles and they are so perfect. I pre-measure the formula into the cup, pre-measure the water into the bottle and put the whole thing out on the counter. Its now a no-fail method for whomever is feeding the baby. All a person has to do is toss the formula from the cup into the bottle and shake. They are perfect for at home and on the go. They will leak if the lid isn't on correctly, but I have never had a problem with the nipple collapsing or with gunk building up."
128613,1,"We bought this as a mattress protector but it is alsoquilted and adds comfort to my son's crib. Works welland one thing I like about this protector is that it is fittedto the mattress, no snaps, no ties, just slip it on like you would a fitted sheet. Dirty? Toss it in the washer. Two thumbs up!"
21964,0,"Well, I read everyone's product reviews before I purchased this. At the end of the day, I still bought it because I had already purchased and assembled the matching crib. Now we just needed to buy a dresser so we can organize the clothes in the nursery.Am I happy with it? Meh. It looks decent.Materials:But I know that the parts you can see are made of nice, solid wood. The parts you can't see (i.e. the drawers and backing) are made of really cheap material. The bottom of the drawers are flimsy. The sides and backs of the drawers are made of a weak engineered wood.Assembly:I have an engineering degree and I absolutely love assembling stuff. The crib was fun to put together. This dresser was a lot of work. Very repetitive. There were literally 100 of the small wood screws. Ok, so this is to be expected from a 4 drawer dresser. What you do not expect is that the instruction manual really sucked, which was surprising because the crib's instruction manual was very good. There were steps that made no sense and there were instructions that referenced parts that didn't exist. I eventually figured to skip those steps. Also, one reviewer mentions that you have to backtrack in order to complete certain steps. This is true!As I went along, I found better ways to assemble the individual drawers. ***Do not over tighten the screws on the drawers because the engineered wood will crack!***Conclusion:So, I know I wasn't getting furniture from Ethan Allen or Dania. But I also didn't expect to get something just a tiny bit better than Ikea.Overall. It looks nice. But I know the insides are cheap. You get what you pay for."
38025,0,"I bought this as a placemat for my toddler. It generally stays in place (but does not ""stick"") and is easy to clean. As others have commented, the design and color does wear off over time. I have made an effort to clean this before food dries to it and I don't scrape it with anything, but it's definitely showing some wear and tear after only a few months of use."
4175,1,"I too looked long and hard to find the perfect bag to carry and decided on this one. I really love this bag. The mommy section in shallower than the rest of the bag so you don't need to go digging around for keys and phone-genius!Also had a hard time choosing color, but this doesn't show dirt and is great for daddy, too.Really great product."
34825,0,"We bought this seat when our son was 6 months, because although he is average weight, he exceeded the height limit on the infant seat. This seemed to be a good value... I liked the idea that it would be a booster seat for several years.Well, it takes up most of my backseat (I drive an AudiA4), does not recline, and as a result, his head drops forward every time he falls asleep! (Which happens pretty much every time he is in the car!!)Also we can not put the front seats back much at all!Boy do I miss the convenience of that infant seat!"
149704,1,"I got this highchair for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. She loves it. It is just as pictured, easy to put together and is quite durable. My only complaint is that it does smell a little coming out of the box so I'm not sure what kind of paint is used on it. But my girl is old enough to not lick it so I'm not so concerned. Can't imagine that you can beat the quality and price."
94922,2,"I was very excited about ordering the Minnie Mouse cups for my daughter. However, I was disappointed when I opened the package and realized the wrong ones were sent. They were Minnie Mouse, but different colors/styles. I know it may not matter to some people but it did matter to me because the babysitter (grandma and grandpa) already have the ones I received and I wanted different ones so they wouldn't get mixed up. Very disappointed. Will not order from Amazon again."
160264,0,"This, and products like it, are nice, but simply not necessary. All you need is the right blanket and a lesson from your nurses at the hospital. In my opinion, if you register for this item and get it, great, but if you don't, don't fret!"
42370,1,"I ordered this wrap on the suggestion of a friend when my newborn was having difficulty napping. The minute I put him in it the first time...he fell right asleep. The second time...he was falling asleep as I put him in it. He loves it, and has for the whole 8 weeks we've had it. I've found it easy to tie, easy to use, and easy to adjust to all the different styles of wrapping it. It's also comfortable for me. However...the main reason to buy this wrap is that your baby will sleep in it, and that's pretty much priceless!"
48618,1,"I wouldn't classify this as a toy because it's fragile. It's very cute and will hopefully last my son's childhood. A little smaller than I expected, but very cute."
19058,0,"I ordered this sling for me and my grand daughter. She is 4 months old and large for her age. This sling did not fit well for us. It seemed like the &#34;Pocket&#34; was too deep for her and scrunched her legs up, when we tried it with her legs out I thought it put too much pressure on her legs.Over all, it didn't fit my body type well, and she seemed frustrated and uncomfortable in it. She loves the Moby, I was just looking for something simpler. This doesn't seem to be it.It probably will work well for someone who isn't as busty as I am. The fabric quality is good, light and seems like it would be easy to clean."
63769,1,This highchair was easy to put together. It is a great size. My daughter loves to sit in it and watch everything.
132907,1,"My brother and his wife purchased the Diaper Dekor for their newborn after friends of theirs had nightmarish experiences with the Diaper Genie. Two years later, their Dekor is still going strong. (Their friends are on their 3rd Genie.) So needless-to-say, they highly recommended the Dekor to me when I got pregnant in last fall. My son is 5 1/2 weeks old now, and I have yet to change the bag refill. The Dekor is so easy to use, even my husband can use it. And best of all, removing the full bag and tying off a new one is so quick & easy, I can do it in my son's room without waking him and still have time to take a shower."
153300,1,"As an adult that has had a problem with incontinence for the past two years, I woke up with a very bad case of diaper rash about two months ago. I tried the normal products that I could purchase locally for weeks and nothing helped. I finally purchased the Butt Paste from Amazon.com out of desperation and because of the good reviews that it received. The Butt Paste has worked very well for me. It has a pleasant smell, applies easily and soothes the itch and tenderness from the rash. My symptoms are almost completely gone at this time which I am very thankful for. I am very happy with this product."
107057,1,"This is the best diaper pail. I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it. I highly recommend this product to everyone!"
73874,1,"This timer was a life saver when we got home from the hospital! I haven't really used it to time diaper changes, haven't found that to be necessary. BUT for feedings you can't beat this thing! If you're smart, you'll take the age-old advice and NAP WHEN YOUR BABY NAPS - and this little gadget will wake you when it's time to feed baby again (if you're lucky enough that baby takes decent naps)! And the left/right slider for breastfeeding moms is AWESOME! And I'm sure that later on it'll be great for timing any medicines she's taking if she's sick. I had this before our daughter was born, but didnt start using it until the 2nd or 3rd day we were home - I was so brain dead that I forgot I had it! This thing is SOOO worth the money! This will definitely become a staple for me when I give baby shower gifts!"
1046,1,We have been getting diapers sent to our house for several months now. It's really great to be able to count on getting this big box of diapers delivered to our home. This is a great service.
77814,1,"My husband and I were set on buying a highchair for our daughter until we realized that a highchair would take up a lot of space in our small dining area. We originally bought the all-in-one reclining booster. It was horrible! It was too big for our chairs, hard to clean and the toys on the tray were meant for an adult to push. Plus, our daughter did not like it at all. We returned the chair and bought the Chicco Hippo. I can't begin to descibe the difference. We can take it with us, the colors are neutral, it is safe &amp; easy to use, and our daughter loves to sit in it with the &quot;big&quot; people. I recommend this item to all of my friends as a &quot;must-have.&quot; It is a great chair!"
159200,1,We did not buy this at first as we were registered for it and did not receive it. We had a swing so we weren't that worried about it. our friends told us that a bouncer was a requirement. We finally went and got this one. Our daughter immediately loved it. She would go to sleep in it. She loved the water sounds. I loved it because I could put her in it in my bathroom so I could see her while I took a shower. She is now 4 1/2 months old and has kind of out grown it now. She prefers her swing or exersaucer now.
61698,0,"This wedge was okay, but was not steep enough to help my daughter with her nightime reflux. We ended up purchasing a Med-Slant for an adult, then we only used the smaller half and that worked much better. This wedge is okay if you are only looking for a slight wedge."
89581,0,"I have been using this product for about a year now. At first i was in a stage of denial that this product was good but i finally gave up and admitted that this product was inferior to Huggies. Don't get me wrong that this is a bad product. Pampers has a name in the market as the best diapers around but my experience is that Huggies is much more superior to it. I was initially using Huggies and when Amazon had the free 2 day shipping deal and at a great price i went with Pampers. I went through about 3-4 boxes and finally gave up. Here is my conclusion of the two products as comparison.Absorption:Huggies was definitely better as after about 10 hours (overnight) the absorption and leakage was definitely better (both from touch and sight) Pampers has leakage as it could not hold a lot and was leaking out.Retention:Huggies is the winner here too as even after the diapers was full, it held the liquid well keeping the baby comfortable. Pampers started leaking on occasions and on other occasions you could tell that the moisture was starting to break out from through the outside as it felt a little wet to touch.Comfort:Pampers material was softer and Huggies has a rougher material, so i would think that Pampers will be the winner here.All in all i will be going back to Huggies as it has a better value in my opinion."
146356,1,"I bought the Jumparoo for my daughter when she was only 3 months old. With a pillow under her feet so she didn't dangle, she was immediately content to sit in the Jumparoo and sway. Now at 5 months she no longer needs the pillow (although she's really tall for her age) and she easily spends about an hour each day in it. The music on this thing is great compared to other toys... not too loud, kind of catchy, and has a short-play feature. The toys mounted on the Jumparoo are good for developing hand-eye coordination and there are several places where you can attach other toys pretty easily. This is about the same size as an exersaucer (not particularly small), but you totally don't need to have both. Would definitely recommend that you buy while your kid is a little younger."
157716,1,This is the best car seat toy we've seen. We bought this for our son when he was 1 month old. Our son is now 6 months old and still loves the frog pacifier holder. The mobile is great and kept him entertained during trips in the car. We were able to use the mobile until he was 5 mos old. We had to take it down when he started pulling at the toys and trying to eat them! He loved staring at the mobile and talking and smiling at his 'friends'. Highly reccomend this mobile.
79666,1,This Toy Organizer is perfect for an assortment of toys. It's soft and is easy to clean. My child tends to get crayons markings everywhere. Just soap and water wet wipe or lysol wipes makes cleanup a breeze.
4302,1,"We have 2 strollers, a lightweight and a big one. This fits both! Fast shipping as well. I am glad I didn't buy the cup holder because this is better and then some."
44975,1,"I knew once my husband went back to work, this would be a requirement for me if I was going to get anything done around the house. We worked with it a few times together to make sure I could use it by myself. It's very sturdy and supportive for my son's head and neck. Sometimes he won't settle down anywhere except right next to me. This makes it so I can comfort him and still have the use of both hands!"
147630,0,I purchased this for my daughter. She is now 8 months old and the hat is STILL TOO BIG. It covers her entire face when I put it on her. It would have been great during the winter months (if it fit) but she gets mad when the hat falls over her eyes. I still gave it 3 stars because it does seem pretty warm. I wish I would have known this product runs big so I could have purchased the smaller 0-6 month one.
153594,1,"When ordering the Ladybug Parade lampshade I went by the product dimensions rather than by what the picture looked like. The shade is actually larger than the picture would lead you to believe, and flared out at the bottom like many lampshades are. I have a milk glass lamp, about the same size as the lamp shown in the picture, and the shade fits it perfectly. It goes very cutely with the Ladybug Parade twin bedding set.It could be packed a little more securely, though. It was dented in some spots. I was able to pop the dents back out and they didn't leave any marks. But other people might not be so lucky. One person stated in their review that the shade arrived crushed. Maybe packing peanuts or some kind of stiff cardboard framework around it would protect it better."
156212,0,"We have the Graco stroller in Theresa and I liked what I read about the swing, so I got it. The swing is really nice and my two month old seems to like it. We had to take the tray off, however, (of course, we don't use it anyway) since it is almost impossible to open. You need both hands (and feet) to open this. I don't know if it is just our swing or if they are all like this. The stroller has a really nice little lever that you just pull and then lift the tray - with one hand, why not just use the same idea for the swing?"
73641,2,"Would have loved it, but it's not rugged enough to survive being dropped, and let's face it... a sleep-deprived mom is going to drop it at least once. Was a great tool while it lasted. Now that it's stopped working it's just a waste of money."
141182,1,"My son has been using this since before he learned to pull himself up with it. He's been using it to 'walk' around the apartment and loves it. It has plenty to keep him entertained and hasn't fallen when he uses it for leverage. The only thing I would change about it--the phone that comes with it, there is nothing to keep it attached to the walker and thus the phone is constantly getting lost or stuck under the sofa. the little triangles and squares have a short rope cord (much too short to be any kind of a hazard), that would've served well with the phone. I wish it was either attached or had come with a different feature. Otherwise, it's great. One of the funest walkers I've seen."
83364,0,Really bummed out the picture just slides in do baby can pull it out. Other ones like this have a small plastic flap that flips over the back of the picture to secure it in. My daughter loves this though!
127883,2,"this bed rail cannot be attached to a regular bed. it was not made clear when purchased that it is some type of rail that has to be nailed in or screwed in. nothing was included with it to show you how to do it plus there was not anything to let you attach it.! very misleading, i returned it"
19603,1,I keep getting plugged ducts and these help so so much. I have used them for months and only wish I had gotten them sooner. Definitely worth the $.
136648,1,"This is the first toy that my baby had when he was a newborn. It has soothed him since the day that he was born and continues to do so! We are so happy with this toy because when he wakes up in the middle of the night, we switch on the soother and he goes right back to sleep! The music is such a familiar sound to him now that he is 4 months old. It is definitely a very good investment! We recommend this to every one!"
148792,1,"I like this pillow. I got it very early in my pregnancy because i tend to sleep on my stomachand i have a bag back. It supports my back and keeps me from rolling on my stomach. My onlycomplaint is that the pillow cover has all balled up. Not from washing it, just from use. So thatstinks!! But I do like the pillow and I would buy again. If the cover was better it would be perfect!"
176776,1,"Babies are grown and out of the house. My wife and I use this device to keep our 'toys' nice and warm! Fill one with water based lubricant and keep a glass 'toy' in it! Nice, neat, convenient. Allows for uninterrupted fun! So, when the babies are done with the bottle...don't throw this useful device away."
141297,1,My son basically learned how to walk with this toy at about 9 1/2 months old. He pushed this thing everywhere and loved playing with the items on the front. We still break this bad boy out sometimes and our son is two-years-old! Great product.
110412,1,"I totally love these locks. I read all of the reviews before I bought them. I am very handy, and was confident that I could install them with no problems. I installed one lock on my nightstand drawer (a little trial & error). I had to adjust and re-install it, but, that was it. I put them on my sons dresser with no problems what-so-ever. ** They should tell you that a certain sized drill bit (7mm or 9/32"") is needed to install them. ** Other than that, they are so great. My son is very hard on furniture, and he cannot get the doors/drawers open for nothing . . . FANTASTIC!!!!!!"
26419,1,"I ordered this pet door for our new cat. It has a clean look, fits well and our cat started going in and out without bothering us to open a door for him within an hour. This door offers good security by keeping all other critters out of our house (a real problem in the mountains). Our cat likes to sit and look out the window in the panel and then when a bird lands on the patio, he flashes through the door. It's obvious, he thinks it great. As far as latches for locking the slider, well, the instructions plainly state that all sliding doors are different and adaptation may be necessary. I discovered in about 30 minutes, we had complete security with a stick in the slider track rail that can only be removed from the rail from inside the house. Opening the door from the outside is impossible with the stick in place. And the best part, the security stick was free from our wood pile.This product slipped into the track simply and easily with the spring loaded adjuster on top and I slid the slider closed to it and we were in business. A great buy and better quality than other pet doors I've seen costing much more in stores."
50049,1,"If you find yourself constantly carrying your toddler on your hip, this product is a lifesaver! My little guy is super interested in whatever I'm doing on the kitchen counters, so he'll just whine and cry until I pick him up - and then not only am I killing my back and arm (he's heavy!) I can't do anything.This hip hammock is a fantastic solution. It's very, very easy to put on and use (which is important, since my munchkin likes to get up and down at random times). I can't do everything I'd be able to do if I weren't holding my kid, but I can certainly do a lot more! Putting the hip hammock on while I make breakfast is now part of our morning routine. Yay!"
95796,1,"My daughter was FINALLY taking a Soothie bottle without much trouble then I learned about BPA. Off to find a new bottle. I tried Green To Grow and Think Baby. Both brands she had trouble with the nipple sucking into the bottle just a couple of sucks into it. So I tried Mam. I read mixed reviews, but the only real complaint I saw was leaking if they were not assembled correctly. While I can see how this might be a problem, we have not had a problem with it. There are more pieces than a normal bottle, but she isn't sucking the nipple into the bottle, I am confident that the bottle is getting clean, there is no BPA and I can hear the vent system working. Lovin' these bottles!"
79287,1,"This blanket is thick, made well. Very snuggly for baby. I love the Zanzibar line, it makes such a cute nursery. My son is extra cute snuggled up with this blanket!"
57100,1,"I bought two of these gates, one for myself and one for my daughter to be used at the bottom of our stairs to protect the safety of a very active baby! It was easy to install, it is extremely sturdy, and it opens with a touch so that you can hold the baby in one arm and use the other hand to unlatch the gate to get up, or down, the stairs. Great product."
9886,1,"i love this simply designed, sturdy potty. my son loves it which is most important. he has no trouble sitting down on it; no pinching, no crampedness, no tipping over. the well sized arm rests help him up & down & the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over! having only 2 pieces & no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean. the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on & read books! great product, great price. i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother's."
46836,2,"My baby really liked this mobile, but one day it stopped turning. I thought it was the batteries, so I replaced them. It worked twice and then it didn't turn anymore. The music still worked till the other day when it just made this long, loud beebing sound. Really upset because my baby thaought this mobile was so fascinating."
149947,1,This tray is great. I got one for my 3 yr old and my 7 year old. Helps them in the car tremendously. They play on it and even eat on it. The edges stop things from rolling onto the floor. I especially like that it is not a hard plastic. Well worth the money - very pleased!
13563,0,"We really needed these after our son keep scraping the paint off of his crib with his teeth... a little scary. We had these on for about 4 months before he got wise and figured out how to pop them off. We'd then see them on the floor and he'd continue chewing the wood. Our solution was to tie the rail on with some ribbon and this did the trick. If you're looking for a more secure solution though, this one isn't so good. It works very well for kids who will leave them alone, but not so much for our curious little guy!"
100855,0,"I sent these diapers as a ""new baby"" gift so I have no direct experience with using them. The new parents like the diapers and the fast delivery(at no cost to me!)from Amazon.com. That is the best that I can do . . ."
141764,0,"I bought this for my 1 year old grandmother and her 3 year old brother plays with it more than she does. I thought you could lock it in place so the child could play with it while it was in one place. But alas, I haven't gotten it to lock."
39680,1,"I'm one of those moms that followings the sleeping safety recommendations. So we don't have any cute bummers or stuff animals in the crib. When it started turning cold, I wanted to keep Baby warm but putting a loose blanket wasn't safe or effective since Baby would just kick it off and move to the opposite end of the crib. This blanket keeps her warm and safe. Its easy to put on as well. I already recommended it to all my friends.Baby is 9mo old and she can still stand up in her crib with this on. We will probably be moving to the one with the foot holes sometime soon."
49654,0,"Cute turtle. Works well, but I wish they had a cut-out in the head for my shower pull so I didn't have to take it on & off all the time."
30893,2,"**READ THIS BEFORE YOU PLAN ON BUYING THE SIT N STROLL***Disfunctions*""Sit N Stroll Car Seat"": A car seat is meant to secure the baby seat to the car. This product doesnt go that far. Rather than figuring out their own product's cons the manual ask us to go and have tether anchors installed in the car by a dealer. People with older cars, time to open your wallets. Luckily my new car is fully equipped with teether anchors but they will only work properly if the carseat is forward facing as you will have a secure base with bottom latches hooking on to seat anchor points (pair of inverted ""U"" shaped metal bars attached directly to your vehicle's frame, located where the vehicle seat bottom and the seat meet)while the top teether hook attaches to the top anchor (located somewhere around the headrest of the car seat). To most new parents, this really doesnt help as the seats have to be rear facing. That means you have to ""Thread"" the vehicle seatbelt through the belt tabs in the sit n stroll which are bacically weak notches on either side holding the seat down. By doing this the car seat belt is basically going over your childs lap. Kids like their legs to be free so they can be at ease in the car, this seatbelt system resembles shackles around your baby`s feet. I dont think any adult would prefer that let alone a baby have to go through this. Inclination of the sit n stroll is another problem, baby`s cant hold their heads up. The sit n stroll's 45 degree full inclination still doesnt rest the baby`s head properly, so you`re basically trying to hold your baby`s head up bcause it feels like its gonna fall off their necks because of this inclination (angle). Giving it a lower angle, similar to that of a baby carrier would have been a plus.Every time you want to get the sit n stroll seat out, you have to unbuckle the carseat belt, take it off the seat tabs then unhook the bottom tether anchors. Putting it back in will require the same steps. So if its raining outside, you have your rear end sticking outside getting wet while your heads inside the car trying to install the seat EVERYTIME.Telescoping Handle of the Sit N Stroll: Either this handle is made of recycled aluminum with really bad quality control or i have arthritis. How about using a stronger material next time you plan on sticking a big fat seat to the end of two skinny shafts. So rather than calling it a telescoping handle, i`d prefer the term Wobbly Handle"". The wheels on this seat are a mess as well. In the fully extended position, this stroller looks like a monster truck on bicycle wheels.There are no returns on this product as the manufacturer is afraid of hairline cracks (quite understandable).BUYING THIS PRODUCT?if you`re planning on buying this sit n stroll i suggest, you do not throw away the original box and receipt. Secondly, make sure you DO NOT TAKE THE TAGS off the Sit N Stroll until you install it in the car and are satisfied (or not). Once you cut the tags off, there are NO RETURNS....!In my case things just didnt look safe from the very begining, so i decided to throw it away. I bought a different brand carseat somewhere else.Money is not worth compromising your child's safety.Sincerely,H.H.""Aircraft Structures Engineer"""
128540,1,"I just gave up my Avent's to get glass bottles that are BPA free. The bottles are great for the cheap price BUT they do take a bit longer to warm up because of the thick glass. You also have to be careful that you don't go from cold (in the fridge) to extreme hot or they can break. You have to gradually warm them up. Overall, I'm liking them."
4271,0,"This thing is just OK. We got it to use with our bugaboo cameleon and its a little bit of an eyesore on a modern looking stroller that we ended up removing it after a month or 2 of use and broke down and bought the pricier actual bugaboo cupholder. I do like that it has a little pocket for your cell phone, or camera etc. and it does hold 2 cups for pretty cheap price. But I just wish it was less bulky and awkward laying. Maybe it is the type of handles the bugaboo has but we had to constantly mess with the velcro straps to get it to lay right so that the drinks where not angled weird."
121763,1,"We have a 4 month old and I still carry my bobby from room to room to nurse her. I love it. It is firm enough to hold up her weight, and so far (knock on wood) isn't showing signs of wear. I would definately make sure you have 2 slipcovers. It is nice to throw one in the wash and have the second as a backup. Although, you can use the bobby just fine without the slipcover. I have the miss cherry and the fluterby covers. The fluterby is much softer than the miss cherry. Must be the type of material, but both are great.The only suggestion I would have is for bobby to put a handle on the pillow covers so it would be easier to carry from room to room with an infant in your arms."
182846,2,"This was ordered on July 21, today is Aug 10 and still now merchandise. You said it was due to ship by Aug 13, now it is changed to Aug 19 - Sept 13. My grandchild is due any day now, hope he can still wear them come Sept. ????? So much for usually shippes with in 24 hours!!"
29404,1,"my daughter is now two- we got this set when she was born, and it's still in perfect shape! we love it!"
5877,0,"Very thin material, but I must say once you get it in, it's a challenge to remove it when you are ready to use the outlet."
132973,1,"I had a Diaper Genie with my first son and stopped using it within a few months because I just couldnt hack the smell in the nursery (even though it's supposed to contain odor!). The Diaper Dekor does what Diaper Genie is supposed to do and it easier to use to boot! The other nice thing is that you can use those plastic grocery bags in a pinch, if you run out of the liners that go with the Diaper Dekor. The one disadvantage is that you dont know when your liner is going to run out (hence the reason I know you can use plastic grocery bags in it!), so make sure you have refills on hand!"
37833,1,"Contrary to what another reviewer said I did not get any of these things or any baby care items when I left the hospital with my baby. So this came in handy. The only items I really use are the nail clippers, thermometer and baby brush. Because the nail clippers are so big in my hand I don't drop them as easily as I would regular small ones if my baby hits my hand. They are nice and sharp also. I haven't found a need for the way the top is able to swival though. Everything is pretty standard and not very low quality as I had feared. The brush is like a typical baby or doll brush (very soft and fine) and doesn't help getting the cradle cap scales off very well. The tub thermometer is ok, but is rather hard to read underwater. The carrying case is clear and zippered which I found very handy since I could see at a glance what was in it and what was missing. I think I would have prefered to just buy the items individually for more money, but if you don't have much to spend this would be good."
17626,1,"Love this stroller. It is a breeze to assemble, light, easy to carry. It folds compactly with one hand (wonders when you're holding a chunky squirmer), turns on a dime, and the handles are comfortable for extended walks. The front wheels can be locked for pushing over grass or other rougher surfaces, and surprisingly it works really well. My 6 month old rides in it with no trouble, and it will easily accomodate her growing little body for well over a year. The seat is cushioned, the ride is smooth. Two drawbacks - the sunshade doesn't extend out very far, offering limited protection at best. It also attaches kind of funky - you have to fold back the fabric on the side bars and snap it over a little button, which doesn't hold it securely at all. I overcame this by purchasing a rayshade by kiddtopomus for $11. The other minor drawback is that the seat does not come up all the way. It lets down smoothly for sleeping, but baby has to sit slightly reclined when it is pulled up as far as it will go. My girl doesn't seem to mind this at all, but other babies might. I don't have a problem with the small storage area underneath, or the lack of cup-holders. If you're not struggling with juggling a baby AND a bag, it is pretty easy to push a stroller and sip on drink."
76950,1,"does anyone know How long does the mobile stays on and the music? My daughter likes to hear noise so I am just curious if this is worth the buy? I know the graco is no good becuase it is battery operated, but the music stays on all night for her? Thanks"
59761,1,"This bath tub is our fourth one for our little cherub. The first one was excellent for a tiny baby, but had insufficient room for a bigger baby. The second was an inflatable, and, although well loved, did NOT last long. The third was found to be bleeding chemicals into the bath water after further research when smelling something strange. This tub is large enough for a big toddler, while safe for an infant too. It is easily cleaned, drained and stored."
2553,0,These diapers seem to run small. My son is husky but usually wears a size 4 in diapers. The size 4 Pampers barely fit around his stomach. Daytime absorbency is fine since he is changed more frequently during the day. The pampers are not absorbent enough for a night time diaper.
51724,1,"I just recieved this swing a couple of days ago for my 3mo. old daughter, we had been using the fisher price papsan cradle swing but were having to put new batteries in it every week. I loved the whole plug in concept and it turned out great my daughter LOVES to swing if she is unhappy it pretty much instanely makes her happy so it only seemed fitting buy this plug in swing, I would definitley recommend it."
80997,2,I didn't like much. Plastic cover is not stable after few use it started tearing and you can see form inside it.
157047,0,"This product has a choking hazard on it. I say remove it immediately.Just like some of the others have stated before me. My daughter got the orange face thing with the balls in it wedged in her mouth. It started to make her choke and then vomit, of course the vomit had no where to go but back down and she started choking more luckily I was there.My daughter likes the toy otherwise and it is very cute but I would take that off that's one scare no one should have to go through."
175177,1,Works good. It is a little hard to get all the air out but for the price it is a good value. My daughter is 4 months and loves the squeaky noise the large frog makes.
48431,1,"We are so spoiled!This product has been a lifesaver... my baby was crying at nap time while I was cleaning up the kitchen and instead of letting it go I checked the camera and her leg was stuck in the crib rails! I may have let her cry for a only few minutes before going in to check on her! It's just nice to see her for reassurance.The only two downfalls I have is the handset whether plugged in or not picks up a good deal of static. Sometimes its the positioning, or the dog walks by, I roll over in bed, or someone walks in the baby's room... The other the cord from the camera dangles on the wall next to the crib- presenting a safety hazard for curious baby.None the less I don't have an issue seeing anyone's baby like other reviews. I did take their comments seriously and actually considered not buying this product. However,I'm in a location where I am probably the only person to own this video monitor and didn't think it would be a big issue as there are SO MANY more PROS to this product.Enjoy! It really is worth the money and can be used for years to come!"
110049,0,"We bought this booster for our soon to be three year old. It is really, really, big. We intended to take it on a flight, but opted for his sister's covertible instead (she's still a lap child) and checked his. Thank goodness we did! This seat would have not fit in the airplane seat comfortably. He already puts his feet on the seat in front of him, but he would have been kicking the person in front of him in this chair.It's a nice fit for him with plenty of room to grow. My biggest issue is the size. It barely fits in my sedan. I even had to move the seat up so it didn't squish his legs. Other than that, it seems pretty safe and relatively comfy for him."
131183,1,"This quilt is oversized, colorful and VERY well made. My granddaughter loves it!"
22390,1,I almost didn't buy this product because of how cheaply priced it was. I am very glad that I did now. The colors are fantastic and I love how easily you can pack this right up. Well worth it!
24336,0,"I purchased a total of 4 of these, thinking I needed to change the bedding constantly due to spit up.The instructions said to hang dry only so I thought I needed more to get through the week. It turns out I can just toss it in the dryer and put it right back on the mattress.Had I known I didn't need to hang dry, I wouldn't have purchased any extra and just went with the 2 they gave me when I purchased the cosleeper.The material is average, nothing special. It holds up well to lots of washes and uses."
6748,1,"Our baby is a Pampers baby. Only problem I have noted is that Pampers diapers don't always hold up well for overnight especially if you child will sleep 10 hours straight. Otherwise, my husband and I are quite happy using Pampers."
14101,2,"We registered for these bottles after using Playtex Vent Aire bottles with our previous foster kids. After a terriable first couple weeks with the AVENT bottles we switched back to the Vent Aire bottles. The AVENT bottles leaked all over our newborn, the nipples were way too big for her tiny mouth and the milk would come flowing out the sides of her mouth. She soaked 1-2 clothes per feeding we never knew how much was acctually getting to her belly!! Our little girl also had terriable gas pains, and very loud choking type adult burps while on these bottles. All this changed for the better after switching to Vent Aire. I do not reccomend AVENT bottles. They do look nice, and appear to be great but they are not!! I suggest using the playtex Vent Aire system."
175988,1,"I searched for days trying to decide on the right carrier for me. I finally decided on this one and I am so glad I did. Its perfect, comfy, and baby and I love it. I use it all the time. Worth the money. very soft and supportive, does not dig into shoulders."
34368,2,"My 14 month old has NEVER had a diaper rash till I ran out of our other cream and bought this. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, perhaps it was an allergy to something in the cream. However, we have used several other creams with no reaction, she had no change in diet, and was not actively cutting a tooth. After 2 days use, she had red welts all over her diaper area and we discontinued use immediately. After that, the rash cleared up and she's been fine."
84718,1,"At first, I was a little concerned about the fuzzy material with the heat source but it acts as a nice gentle reading light for a child."
3194,1,Every new mother needs a swaddleme. I have used several brands from numerous stores and I think the Kiddopotamus brand is the best. We have swaddled my daughter every night since she was one week (she's now 4 mo.) and are purchasing the next size. I now give one of these as a present at every baby shower.
62516,0,"I had no problem installing this on my oven. It was enough of a hinderance for my 2 year old son to lose interest in the oven for quite a while. When he did become interested and persistent in ""exploring"" the oven, the lock gave me enough time to get him away from the oven if I was across the kitchen. When he pulled hard enough on the oven handle, the lock would pop open. I haven't seen anything that is any better. You should never have your child anywhere near a heated oven, but if s/he does get away from you for a second, this lock is enough of a deterrent and hinderance to give you a few extra seconds to grab your child."
177025,0,"I have this gate set up in two different parts of my house... one part as-is, and one part with two extensions. The gate that that has no extensions is very durable, and easy to open, however there is a bar that goes across the bottom of the ""door"", and myself and my guests are always bumping bare toes on it...ouch!In the other part of my house, I have this gate with two extensions. It's such a LONG gate, that there is no stability... the whole thing kind of sways, and my toddler finally was able to pull it out of the wall. There aren't many gates out there that will let you cover such a wide room, though, and for that it was nice while it lasted."
1164,1,"I have been using these for a little over 4 yrs...before that, I admit I was a Huggies mom for 9 yrs. But after using Pampers ..Huggies felt like hard paper and did not smell fresh. Overall I like Pampers because they look cute, smell fresh and work well. The only time I've had leaks is when they need to move up a size, and occasionally poo up the back (I'd love to see a tighter elastic fit across the back)"
132406,1,"I'm very happy with my purchase of this warmer. It does a great job keeping wipes warm, without drying them out. I also love the little light on it. Makes the warmer very easy to find at night when you don't want to turn on bright lights."
111742,1,"My husband first installed this gate when our oldest child was learning to crawl. After I watched him tumble down the stairs when he was just 6 months old, we decided we had to do something! But, I wanted a gate that I could open and close with just one hand. Because this gate is actually installed into the wall, I could do that without having to take a whole gate down every time I needed to go up or down the stairs. We found it so sturdy, relialbe and easy to use that we took it down and installed it into our new house when we moved a year later! Now, our 4th baby is starting to crawl, and I have all the confidence it this gate as the first day we used it! We have not had a single problem with it in 6 years and 4 children later. I have read another review where the consumer complained that it pulled out of the wall too easily, but I just do not understand that. I have had my children, 2 cats and several nieces and nephews climb all over this gate, and we have never had a single problem! We have way more than gotten our money's worth! As a matter of fact, I am now getting one for my mother to use for her 2 puppies!"
6442,2,"I bought this pad for its larger size. I haven't seen any other brands with 34"" length -- those extra inches are really nice for a toddler! However the plastic material tears soooo easily. My last pad (diff't manuf.) held up for 16 months before developing one small tear. This one developed its first tear in the first week and 3 months later it is riddled with big tears. We're so careful when changing our LO and don't wear any rings or bracelets which might snag on the pad, but nonetheless it tears. We now have to buy another smaller one as this one is no longer useable after 3 short months."
93082,1,"I have used this several times since I purchased it for my two year old grandson. Except for a center strap that bothers me but not him, I have no complaints about this item. It sets up easily---he can open & close it independently. The mattress cover that comes with it washes well and retains its' fit. Great quality and price."

131950,2,"I bought the SnugGlider as a baby shower gift and it arrived very promptly from Right Start. I was then contacted by the recipient of the gift and told that the motor did not work. I contacted Right Start who confirmed that they would exchange the item and sent me a UPS label for return of the item. When the family went to return the item for exchange, they discovered from Right Start that 2 days after my enquiry they went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The customer service representative was very polite and apologetic, but confirmed that there was no way to exchange the item and no possibility of a refund. Please don't buy from Right Start if it appears by chance as a vendor on Amazon."
94381,1,"I was amazed at reading some of the poor reviews for the Avent bottles. I purchased the Avent bottles for my first child because they attached so nicely with the breast pump and the bottles were good for storing in the freezer. I was extremely pleased with them. I never had a problem with leaking or gas.I did hear that some of the other nipples (size 2 and up) can give a faster flow of milk, so I just stayed with the newborn size and never had any issues.Leaking was never a problem and to be honest, I never even read the directions, I just used common sense in assembling the top."
37072,0,"My 1 year old son and my friends 3 year old twins love this seat. They seem very comfortable in it. It is well padded, roomy enough to grow with them and it reclines.I have only had the seat for a few months now and the straps do seem to twist on thier own (my husband and I have actually argued over who is twisting them ----- me or him?) I guess if you have a very calm child and don't have help from that child in the buckling and unbuckling process they would probably be less likely to get twisted.We can also never seem to get it tight enough (we have a caravan and use the latch system). I know the base is supposed to move somewhat for the reclining process but it seems too move too much. Can that be safe?My friends straps are also always twisted but she can get her seats in tighter (she has an older caravan and uses the lap belt).Cleaning is not to bad. We have taken the cover off once and did not find it difficult. My friend has never had difficulty with the cover either.This seat is ok but my husband and I are going to try a different brand for his car."
54407,1,I love the mobile. When my son was only a week old I think he enjoyed the soothing music. But now at 7 weeks he is really enjoying looking at the animals and watching them as they move. He even smiles at it while it is on. It is so cute to see him enjoying it! My only suggested improvement would to allow for the music to be played without the movement or just the movement without the music. But overall I would highly recommend it!
155059,1,"I have twin girls....so we go through a lot of diapers day and night! At around 7 months, the girls started to have slight leaking through their regular ""day use"" diapers at night. So, I purchased some night time diapers that offer greater absorbancy. We have had nothing but great results with these thicker diapers. As for size, the girls just moved to the next size up in order to continue to provide the same great leak protection. I have learned that SIZE DOES MATTER....don't always go by the package, but by the successes. The weights listed on the box are just suggestions, but I have learned that once the girls have any minor leaking they are ready for the next size up. Oh, one more thing...my girls would leak in the back and my son used to leak in the front. Don't you think someone could design a special diaper that is tailored just for GIRLS or BOYS! Happy shopping! :)"
68997,1,so happy to have found these online and with free shipping right to my door :)
175505,2,"Maybe I just read the description wrong, but this is not a gate that you want to swing open and closed all the time to walk though. It does open, but it is not easy. It also comes off the hinges very easily. As a gate that you step over but that you can remove easily it would work, but as a gate that opens to walk though this is not what you want."
64699,1,We got these for our 3 months-old daughter. She's not teething yet but loves putting everything in her mouth. I decided to give these rattle-tethers a try and we just love them. There's a fish that's made of soft fabric exterior that allowed our baby to safely suck on it without getting discouraged by the not so soft plastic rattles. But now at 4 months she's enjoying other toys as well. They are very bright and make all sorts of fun noises and she loves it. There are 5 toys and we rotate between them so she doesn't get bored. Get these by all means and you'll have your baby entertained while having her motivated to explore new senses - visual and touch.
114749,1,"Light, easy to transport (I move it often between the kitchen, dining room and patio), and good value. Eliminates need for a big, ugly highchair that takes up so much room and is bulky to move around."
122747,1,"Cons:1) Seat belt (buckles)- very difficult to use; I caught my fingers in it a few times2) Seat cover- it can be washed (delicates / air dry or hang dry) but you have to remove some screws each time you do this ~ this is the only reason why the seat cover is listed under the cons. The way around this is to clean it using disinfectant wipes and it works fine and we never had problems w/ the plastic as noted in some of the reviews (even after washing)Pros:1) Multi-purpose use, of course - high chair & desk/chair!2) Very sturdy- both as a high chair and as a chair & desk- my daughter can climb on it with ease and I don't have to worry about her flipping over while going on/off of it (unlike other toddler chairs)3) Easy to clean - use disinfectant wipes!4) My daughter just loves sitting on it- She loved it as a high chair (9 months onwards) which allowed me to do some chores while she ate her food/snacks- Now that she's almost 2, she loves it as a desk/chair - it's where she eats her snacks and colors/scribbles w/ her paper & crayonsI'd rate it 4.5 stars. :)"
147806,2,"I registered for this car seat based on the reviews that it ahd at the time which were all positive. Also I've heard good things about the PP products so I decided that this was the carseat for me. well I wish I didn't! I despise it and my 5 wek old daughter agrees. she gets sooo sweaty in it even on a short ride. Also it squishes her on the sides and she is by no means a ""big baby."" As far as ease of getting in and out of the car, I have an SUV and it is very difficult to fit in and level it safely. The sunshade also is a joke. It does not do anything to protect for the sun. Please either get a Britax or Graco snugride."
32476,1,"Pros1. Tooless installation2. Did I mention that you don't need any tools to install this??!! (i.e. hand-tighten)3. If you follow the instructions it is a VERY basic install, very (5-10 minutes)4. Nice styling, modern5. Comes with extensions; use both, use one, use none. Your call peopleCons1. Perhaps it's too easy to install, hmm2. Needs to be more complicated3. Looks too good, I have caught multiple 'friends' trying to uninstall it to take home4. kids seem annoyed when I shut it. Apparently they want an out (needs escape hatch)"
176694,0,"A dedicated steam warmer is definitely better than any other option such as a pan of water on the stove (takes too long) or the microwave (danger of uneven heating; robs contents of nutrients).We have ours in a second-story nursery and have been pleased with it. The only problem is that the results can be unpredictable - sometimes one capful of water will do the trick just fine, sometimes the bottle feels hot but the milk inside still cold, and sometimes it just goes to town and overheats the contents. Nonetheless, I figure any heating process will be unpredictable, so I can't fault this model.The unit comes with adapters to hold any standard 4- or 9-oz. bottle; we've used Avent with no problems."
309,1,"The Good: -hold an incredible amount of wetness -fit boys and girls well (have tried on both babies) -cute sesame street designs that though my infant doesn't care about, makes my toddler want to ""help"" change diapers -great cost per diaper here on amazon, delivered to your door and in a box big enough to not feel like you're always buying diapers! -never had any bm leakageThe Not So Good: -the baby dry diapers have leaked before, but only when baby has slept a long time in the night (12 hours). The girl never leaked, but the boy has. Probably due to where the urine is held in a boy's diaper. -tends to feel squishy all the time, even if there is no need to change it yet -deteriorates very quickly in the diaper genie. I had it fall out and under the bag once, and so I had to pick it up after a week to put it back in the bag, and it no longer kept the wet in. Not sure what happens to other brands of diapers, as this only happened once with one of these!I recommend this diaper after the baby is no longer in the pooping all day long stage, as the pampers swaddlers are definitely best for this stage. The older baby does great with this diaper for the cost!"
119859,0,"This bassinet appears to be made of quality materials from the photo and description, but the bassinet section actually is made of cardboard, despite a review to the contrary. However, the cardboard is relatively sturdy and adequate for the purpose - holding your baby for the early weeks/months. The toybox base is made of lower-quality particle board that is painted and the paint job on ours was not very good -- there are lumps of paint, streaks, and other imperfections. The versatility of this unit makes it worthwhile compared to other bassinets, but it is slightly overpriced for the quality of the workmanship. It is not something that will last very long."
32607,1,We are very happy with this gate. It keeps the kids out and looks nice. We love the door part so we can still get in and out to put fires on during the winter. We would highly recommend this product:)
117854,1,This is a great set for kids. The benches provide support on three sides where a chair would not. The benches push directly under the table to avoid bumped heads while children are crawling around. This feature also adds to great space saving.
57973,0,"I got this item as a gift but it took too long to heat up!!so what I did was boil my babies water wait for it to cool and put it in a thermos it works wonders all I do is pour the amount needed add formula shake it, and set the thermos was alot cheaper and the water stays warm 24-7 by the time my baby turns a year he wont need bottles just cups for milk I am returning this product, for something that the baby may really need.like naybe spill proof cups since i dont have my receipe I only get store credit"
104624,1,"I looked at all child products to help with keeping track of an active 3 year old (grandson) for a recent Disney trip. My daughter wanted nothing to do with any of the products that she felt were ""like a dog on a leash"" so I looked for something else. This product was perfect! My grandson liked it on his shoe and even though he was never out of sight it was nice to know we had it. My daughter kept the locator on her belt loop and we actually used it a couple of times when our parties got separated to find one another (via my grandson's shoe)! We never tried to check the distance per the manufacturer's claim, but I would guesstimate it to be correct. A few people actually questioned us about it and thought it was an excellent idea. (Of course we only purchased this for the just in case...we kept him close by at all times - this unit does have a turn off switch on the bear) Worth the money and would definitely purchase again!"
123752,0,"I thought my daughter would really like this toy becuase she loves putting things in anything. But suprisingly, this only keeps her attention for a few minutes at a time. I think maybe the balls just drop too fast and she doesn't get it. There isn't really a lot to do. She really loves the Peek-A-Blocks Giraffe. She will play with it for 20 minutes easily a couple times a day. Get that instead. This one just doesn't keep interest long."
91771,0,"For me this bag really was the perfect size... not too big, not too small. It had compartments for everything I needed. Even had a removable zippered pouch. The only thing that I wish they would have done differently is the zipper into the bag. First it doesn't meet the material from end to end so when it's closed you have about an inch on each side that you can put your fingers in the bag. So when the bag is unzipped you have a terrible time getting things out of the bag since essentially the bag is wider than the zipper will open. I struggled to get the changing pad out and really struggled getting the cardboard packing out, finally had to try and fold it in half while still in the bag. I'm returning this bag as it really just won't function right with this current zipper. I'd also like to point out that it says the strap is adjustable... it isn't (that wasn't a problem but thought some folks might like to know)"
166021,2,"I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine."
80207,1,"I have to say, even though Alex is my first child and Pampers being the only diaper I have really tried...other than the free samples of Huggies...the NB size has worked for us. Alex was 6lbs 7.5oz at birth and one month later 7lbs 12oz and still in the NB size...debating on moving up a size. The only problem we had with leaking is remembering to put ""the pee-pee down"" (I have to say it to remind myself at changings!haha) When he ""pointed north"" we had leakage which was our fault. Other than that, it is amazing at how much a NB diaper can hold!"
86927,2,Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw. I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush. I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth. This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink! It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size. Strangest thing I have ever seen. Do not use/purchase this nurser/bottle if you boil your bottles to sterilize them due to you or your child being sick.
184199,1,"This thing is so handy and so versatile. No matter what container is being used, this holder can keep it secure."
91037,1,"this carrier was very good and def worth 20 dollars but i have my son facing forward in it because hes 15 pounds and the back support keeps rasing up, i know it says to fold it down but it just wont stay. but i pinned it down so now it works wonders. and its also very good on my back!"
136606,0,"I bought this kind of protector because they weren't selling the Prince Lionheart seat protector (I have been using one of those). I think the mats are okay, but the issue I have is that they are not very tough on the bottom, so when you're putting a heavy carseat on top of one in a car with leather seats, this protector won't protect your leather seats from being stretched by the car seat. The Prince Lionheart seat protector is really thick and tough on the bottom, so the contours of the car seat won't dig into your actual seat. These Kiddopotamus protectors are much softer, so they don't offer a lot of protection from stretching, although I'm sure they do fine for stains and such. All in all this product is well-made, but I would recommend it for cars with cloth upholstery and not leather. If you want something for leather, try the Prince Lionheart ones."
130660,1,"This swing is awesome, my son loves the fish!! When you put him near the swing with the fish going around in circles he just laughs and enjoys himself so much. If he is cranky and you put him in it he will go right to sleep. The only cons again would be batteries, Stock up you can't get enough and the fish and music are timed and turn off automatically!! He also loves the changing light colors and it doesn't make much noise at all.I would suggest this to anyone."
120376,1,"This is a &quot;must-have&quot; monitor. After a month of constantly checking my daughter at night, we purchased this monitor. I can finally sleep!!! This monitor may cost more than others but in my opinion it's worth 10X the price just for the peace of mind it brings. Buy this and sleep better knowing you've just insured that your baby is safer."
144288,1,"Our daughter Reagan loves this seat. She falls asleep everytime we put her in it. It has very comfortable foam padding. It is easy to take out and install and adjust the straps. I love the padded covers over the straps that keep them from cutting into her skin. Maybe a little pricey but I was told it is suppose to be the ""cadillac of car seats"". Britax also has some of the best safety reviews of any seat and you can't put a price on safety. Also it is a good way to start your little Bama fan off right."
120395,1,"This is the best hundred bucks I've spent in a long time. I used to check on Jr. all the time, waking up, trying to hear him breathe. Well worth the money. I still look over and see the green light blinking that lets me know he's fine. But this product is great.Other people have mentioned not being thrilled with the sound monitors. I second that. I'd buy a higher quality sound monitor and buy the $79 Bebe Sounds with no monitor. But Babies R Us didn't have those in stock.I read about an NBA player's daughter dying of SIDS. I can't imagine not having one of these."
104937,1,"I started using this as a facial soap. I use the liquid in the shower for the rest of my body. The smell is light and mild, and the soap itself leaves my face feeling smooth, from what I can tell. I've been playing around with different soaps and I feel like this could end up being one I stick with. I'll update later if I change my mind. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and am OK with the results. I already have pretty decent skin, so what I would look for would be drier skin, or any filmy, unpleasant residue, which I don't get with this soap."
111919,1,"After spending considerable time researching stairway gates, I stumbled onto this gate. At-first glance it appeared somewhat inadequate compared to other gates we were considering. However, after having conducted a lot of research into baby gates and finding that a major factor in gate safety is the quality of the hardware, we found that the hardware included with this gate more than made up for its simple wood construction. Even though this gate is fairly basic, the mounting hardware is a lot more robust than gates costing a hundred dollars more. This was an important feature for us since we had once bought a beautiful stained wood gate (paid around $150.00) which was very sturdy and very well constructed -but came with hardware that was terribly cheap. This forced us to ultimately remove the gate due to safety concerns (the hardware kept pulling free from the wall and finally bent beyond repair under normal pass-through conditions). The obvious emphasis of that product was cosmetics. Conversely, the EVENFLO Top of Stair gate comes unfinished and is of a simpler construction than one would intuitively expect. However, its design emphasis was clearly on providing an adequate (affordable) wood gate with very good mounting and latching hardware. We feel strongly that no matter how well a gate may be built; if its mounting hardware is cheap it won't perform as needed to ensure the safety of your little loved ones. We've now had two of these gates installed at the top and bottom of our stairs for the last two months and remain very happy with their consistent performance when subjected to the constant testing of a 14 month old."
54532,1,"My son LOVES this mobile! This is the first toy that ever entertained him. He would lay in his crib and stare at it for several minutes when he was just a week or two old. The brightly colored animals dancing all around him absolutely mesmerized him! Now he is 4 months old and still loves it. When he wakes up early in the morning, he spins himself around to look and coo at it. We'll be sad to have to take it down in a few weeks!"
30846,1,Fits two of my daughters classic or natural avent bottles without a problem and keeps them cold for hrs. Just what I was looking for and with no seperate ice packs to deal with just keep it in freezer till time to use . Nifty item for anything needing to stay cold also has extra pocket inside and on outside which is nice to
183454,1,"I got a gift certificate from my baby shower from Amazon. I decided to put it to good use and see if I could find a good diaper bag on-line for a reasonable price. I came across this bag and read the reviews. Based on the reviews and the picture, I bought it. I absolutely love this bag. It has so many pocket compartments. It fits all the necessities and there's still room to fit even more. My baby likes her milk warm so I've even been able to stuff a huge thermos in this bag. The big handle on this bag is great. It's really sturdy (the material). It's not wimpy like some diaper bags you find at Target or other stores. It seems like it can withstand a lot. Plus the color of the bag makes it very unisex. I'm not into hokey diaper bags with looney toon characters. This is a real mature bag that goes with any outfit, contains all the items you need it to, Daddy can even carry it and still feel masculine, and it can withstand the weather. I highly reccommend this bag. I would give it five stars but the only downfall I see is that it only comes in one color. I think this bag would be great in black."
12257,1,"Just moved into a new house with a very ominous looking staircase; straight down. I purchased this gate out of necessity for the safety of my 29 month old. The hard part was that I have a wall on one side and an old wrought iron railing on the other side. After reseaching my options I chose the Safeway. I did need to purchase two installation kits, but it was well worth it. I used two boards on the railing side with the tie wraps and I'm amazed at how well it holds. I used a third board (in the second kit)on the wall, evening out the surface to match the molding on the staircase. We had been in the house for about 3 weeks and I was always very nervous watching her around the stairs. Now I don't worry at all. It's very sturdy and very easy to open and close. To me, there really was no choice. This gate is it!"
83006,1,"This is nice accessory, I'm happy that I ordered it. It makes the seat more comfortable, and also protects the seat, it's easy to wash. The material could be better quality, it feels a bit cheap... And for the steep price, I would have expected better. Still, it's the only one designed for this seat and it fits perfectly, for me it's an essential with my BOB. Bottom line, I would recommend it."
20338,0,"These bottles were recommended to me when I was getting ready to go back to work after having breastfed my son exclusively for 3 months, because these are closest to breastfeeding.Well, my son refused to take any bottle for weeks, until I got him these, so for that they were a God send plus they seemed to help with his gas.Leaking was a problem when I forgot to put the disk on the bottom which is likely to happen only when you start using these bottles because after while it becomes second nature to put them back together correctly. And if you don't tighten them well, they will also leak, but again, once you get the hang of it, shouldn't be a problem.What drove me nuts was having to take them apart to clean and then back together. Way too many parts and too many nooks and crannies. Some people might like this, like another reviewer who said other bottles always had a film of milk on the bottom , but I wanted something that was hygienic and practical at the same time! I needed simple and efficient. I ended up dreading washing these bottles. It seemed that I was always the most exhausted when I HAD to wash the many parts. Again, that might not be a big deal to some, but for me it wasn't working.I ended up switching to the drop-ins. I could get the same gas reducing system while reducing the number of parts that had to be cleaned,the taking apart and putting back together AND since they don't have a bottom to begin with, there was no film of milk at the bottom! The first night I rinsed the drop ins I was sold. What I relief to be done so quickly! The downside is the cost of buying liner refills, but I'd rather the added cost than to frustrate myself every night. You have to decide what's most important to you.One thing though, that annoys me about the drop ins and the wide bottles, is that they ALL come with slow flow nipples, so if you have a baby older than 3 months and want the fast flow, you have to buy them separately and $4 for two seems quiet expensive to me. Kind of a rip-off. Why not at least put the fast flow nipples on the larger bottles which are most likely going to be for bigger babies? Hummm...."
136451,2,"It took my wife and I almost 2.5 hours to set this thing up. As we were setting up, I was in disbelief about what poor quality and outrageous instructions. After setting the thing up, I contacted Amazon.com Customer Support to complain about this poor product and was able to get a refund. De-constructing, re-packaging, and moving around the 100+ lbs. box was NOT easy. Here's a list of complaints my wife made after setting the dresser up:-Drawer tracks don't line up, so the drawers are crooked-Can't pull drawers in and out without getting stuck at various points, very loose and jiggle and then jam-Bottom of one drawer is cracked-The sides of the drawers cracked as we screwed in the tracks. They started cracking immediately, but we didn't have any other way to attach the tracks.-Screw holes are uneven for one door bracket - need to keep the brace extended to the max in order for it to be almost straight-Wood in between drawers and door cracked when screwing in large bottom screw. It started cracking at only half way screwed in and then got worse as we finished-Several screws made the wood crack when screwing in the back (this also started around half way - we did not over-tighten). The cracks are visible from the inside.I am VERY disappointed that Amazon.com is selling this... My advice, go buy a more quality piece of furniture to use as a baby dresser.Amazon- please listen to all the customer reviews and take this offline.http://www.amazon.com/review/create-reviewSide note: We got the ""Natural"" color- and it had a pinkish hue to it. Did not seem very ""natural"" color."
7988,2,I got these for my daughter when she was about 20 months old. I had been putting her in the potty for a while and she was kind of potty trained for the big job but not for the small one. I got this thinking this would do the trick.... it would make her feel wet and she would tell me. So far that hasn't happened. Maybe this doesnt feel as dry as an ordinary diaper but it still a diaper... she doesn't feel wet and it hasnt helped with potty training at all. It makes more sense to try Gerber/Luvable training pants (thick cotton panties)...your child will feel the wetness and its cheaper
1708,2,"We found this diaper undependable. Leaky and can't take an average load (liquid or solid). Difficult to manage the night shift, when his clothes and the sheets get wet.Prefer swaddlers any day."
93076,1,"This thing is great. It is easy to set up and comfortable. i layed in it myself to make sure, even though I far exceed the weight limit.:)It held up very well. I have an eighteen month old who has given me quite a dilemma in travel or sleep-over situations, since he can climb out of a pack and play, but is too young to put in a big bed. This worked like a charm. My only complaint would be that the cot does not lock into fold-out position. this did not really pose a problem. I just expected that it would have had something like that. Maybe the manufacturer will add this feature in the future"
20804,1,"I like these bags-I bought them because my daughter and I are fighting off thrush and they are quick and easy. However, last night when I was pumping, I noticed that let down was not happening really quick as it usually does. I realized that using these bags had caused my pump parts to warp and the suction was not working correctly. Luckily, I had some new parts handy. So, use with caution on pump parts. My microwave is old-I don't know if that makes a difference."
159632,1,"This bouncer honestly saved my life when my newborn came into the world. At times, as new parents, we could not figure out how to soothe our baby. (Now we are pros with a baby who is happy and sleeps through the night for 12 hours since he was 4 months old!) Anyway, we finally found out that occassionally he just wanted to be left alone. When we put him in his Aquarium Bouncer, he was immediately soothed by the vibrations, soft music, and the sound of bubbling water. He even fell asleep in it several times. I would bring this chair into my bathroom and set it next to the tub while I soaked in a bubble bath. What a luxury! At 7 months, we still use this on occasion when he is fussy in the evening and not yet ready for bedtime. He is a big baby and will outgrow it soon, which is sad. I wish he could stay little forever! But this bouncy chair was worth the small investment. It still looks brand new and I will be saving it for my next baby..."
49554,2,"Item arrived in a dented package (not from the mail, the cardboard had been scraped but not the outside of the mailed package). The instructions were pretty well useless, which would be fine if putting it together were as simple as it should be. The tabs and whatnot were sized incorrectly. I guess it does keep the socks from mixing with the underwear, but that's about it. I don't recommend this."
183058,2,"I bought this stroller to be used as a lightweight travel stroller. I was surprised when I went to strap my daughter in and realized there are no shoulder straps, only a low waste belt. My daughter can bend forward at will, and hang her head down, and I'm pretty sure she would fall forward and out, if we stopped short. I showed this to other Mom's I know, and they were shocked at how unsafe it is. With regard to other features, the stroller is truly a nice light weight, maneuvers well, and folds down easily. In addition to the shoulder straps for your child, they should have added a shoulder strap for the adult to tote the stroller around when it is folded. Regardless of the other nice features, I would not recommend this stroller because of the lack of safety, and I'm not even sure what to do with mine. How do you give away an unsafe product?"
135286,1,"I purchased this for my daughter. She had twin premies. She positively loves it, as she uses it to nurse and to prop up the babies. She said it was the best thing she has received! I positively give it 5 stars!!!!!"
137118,1,The item came quickly and the bottles are nice but my baby won't convert:(
115617,0,"Nice looking, but getting the bottle in and out of the compartment is hard and if it leaks, the compartment is difficult to clean and smells."
48925,1,"It's a great product, plenty big with the 6 panels, folds up for storage. My concern is about folding it up too much, the plastic seems flimsy, and gives a lot. For the Amazon price I'm okay with it, but no way would I pay what my local stores were charging for it, it would seem like a cheap rip off at those prices."
93783,1,We have owned a Super Gate V now for approximately five years. I don't know why anyone would not like this gate. We used it with our first child in a very busy traffic area between our wide kitchen entrance and living room. When we moved we lost the two plastic panels that you attach it to the wall with but I was able to find the extra parts online very reasonable and was able to install it without a problem. I am happy to have this gate to use in our new house again for our newest addition. This is a very effective gate. My daughter never climbed it or learned to open it. (My son may be a different story!). I would highly recommend this gate to anyone. It slides back to fit smaller areas and is very sturdy as well.
41838,2,"I received this stroller a week ago and I am very disappointed. Initially it looked great and I was very happy about my purchase. I assembled the stroller without particular problem but from the first day it was very hard to push like the wheels were stiff or something. The wheels don't roll properly even in flat ground and it is absolutly impossible to push this one handed (with my 9 months older). The next day I decided to give it another try with my son (2 years old) and it was even worse. The stroller felt like we were pushing a broken shopping cart, it' s extremely hard to push also with two hands and when we try to turn on the streets only two wheels stay on the ground.In conclusion I loved the features provides on this stroller, the soft fabric and the large seat but those are the extras and first of all I need something with which to bring my kids around easily every day! Finally, the description says 14 lb but I feel like it is more heavier.In conclusion, I had more than ten strollers since my first kid was born and I have to say this is so far the worst."
154736,1,"I don't have any children, let alone babies, but I love to keep baby wipes around the house. These are great, because they are unscented and have aloe. I use them to take my makeup off at the end of the night and for other general bathroomy things. Stocking up on baby wipes is something I make sure to do. I'd recommend this to anyone; parent or not!"
151612,1,"I love this oil! So far (29 weeks) I have no stretch marks and I've gained about 30 pounds already. My mom has horrible stretch marks, so I assumed I'd get them (there is still time I suppose). I'm indifferent to the smell - it is faint and pleasant enough. I put the oil on every day after I shower, and reapply if I notice my belly getting itchy or dry. I've been using it on my chest, belly, low back, bum and hips. I actually intentionally put enough on that I have a slight oily layer on my skin and I've never had a problem with it staining clothing. Occasionally, I will notice that my bra looks oily, but it comes out in the wash. I've never noticed it on my other clothing at all. I'm not sure if it would fully rub in or not. What I love most about this product is that it is all natural. So many other items used to prevent stretch marks contain toxic ingredients. I don't want those on my body ever, but especially not on my belly while pregnant! The only downside to this product, in my opinion, is that the bottle gets messy (oily). I don't feel comfortable traveling with it because I'm afraid it will get oil everywhere."
42133,1,I was thrilled to find the UF Marathon since it has been sold out for so long. If you are considering buying one do it quick b/c they go fast. Great car seat! Baby loves it and daddy likes it too!
56254,0,"This is a decent concept but the makers fell short on design when they included such cheap audio electronics. The monitor and video quality are as expected - black and white CRT screen with a vertical hold adjuster, which you'll need to use just like the old days of black and white TV. Nighttime vision is OK but I have seen better IR illumination on cameras.The main problem is that the microphone is set to such a sensitive level that there is no way to avoid noise on the other end. There is no way to turn the sound down to an acceptable level on the reciever, so you must turn the sound off to avoid the nuisance of constant static and buzzing. The sensitivity overload is further enhanced by the blinking red lights (visual cue to sound) that blink constantly, even when there is silence by the microphone.Since bad audio reception and static are the main consumer complaints about these types of products, I recommend avoiding this unit until they can figure out the audio issues. If you're just looking for good video coverage for cheap, then this might be a good unit for you."
35379,1,This works great for a Mclaren Triumph. It is super easy to attach and folds up easily and fits in a small bag.
24676,1,"I have been looking for something like this for a while. Anything even close was double the cost. The hands free feature is a bonus.This is really made to last, it's solidly made. However, it is a little stiffer and I have to really push down on it to open the gate. Great if you have a toddler that is industrious enough to figure out how it works. My use is for keeping my dogs speparated from other parts of the house. Good deal"
54067,2,"I have 2 of these mirrors, one in the plaid pattern and one in the brown leather/suede. How 2 of the exact same mirrors can be so different is beyond me. While the leather one is great (so far), the plaid one has fogged up and cannot be wiped clean, making it almost impossible to see my daughter. The sticky tab that can be used when not mounting it on a headrest held for about 10 minutes and then continually fell forward. When I finally moved it to a headrest, I was tightening the strap and it snapped right in 2 making the entire mirror impossible to use at all! It's a needed accessory but this one disappointed me."
29755,0,"Love the bag for traveling but it would be nice if the changing pad unzipped completely from the bag. It is too hard to balance the bag at the end of an airport bathroom changing table and be able to change the baby on it at the same time. Would like the option of removing it completely. Otherwise, great bag, lots of pockets for holding small things (q-tips, creams, etc.) and the main compartment has plenty of room for clothing, diapers and various other things. Also has a clear zippered compartment for dirty/wet items."
77584,0,"It's worked great through our first 2 children. Lent it to a friend for one of their babies. Then brought it back for our third child: working great at first. Now, the swing mechanism doesn't work anymore. It slowly faded. Planned obsolescence?"
31346,1,"This rack holds everything! We use it for bottles, pacifiers, medicine droppers, nasal aspirator.... you name it. It is extremely easy to assemble and incredibly light weight. We use Dr. Brown bottles and LOVE that the blue part of the bottles can dry upright in this rack...they fit perfectly in the gaps on the top tier. The fact that it spins is a bonus! Keeps the counter-drenching to a minimum. Highly recommend this drying rack."
468,2,"We have LOVED Pampers - have used them exclusively for all 3 of our children until now. I just upped my almost two year old from Baby Dry 4's to size 5's, expecting no big change, just help with her volume increase. Something has definitely changed! I first noticed a new chemical-like smell I never smelled with any previous Pampers Baby Dry. Then my daughter quickly developed a diaper rash. This child has never had a diaper rash a day in her life before this. I was still hesitant to believe it really could be the Pampers (they're so great! no leaks! so cheap on Amazon! I've ALWAYS used them!), but finally bought some Seventh Generation diapers to try, and the diaper rash vanished. MAJOR BUMMER!!! Why ruin such a great product, P&G? So sad to cancel my Subscribe & Save sub for these... :-("
100250,2,These diapers leek up the back when my baby poops! Then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on! Annoying!!
67740,1,"This is better than a Bassinett for the following reasons - when you bring your newborn home... you want to keep an eye on the baby, every breath and noise your baby makes you want to be able to quickly look over to see whats going on. This co-sleeper makes that possible. I baught a bassinett first and the next day i made my husband get the co-sleeper. I was constantly sitting up (straining my fragile post-birth abs) throughout the night. It doesn't look as 'pretty and fluffy' as a bassinett but it is the best purchase. We use the bassinett during the day in the living room or when I am up and walking around anyway. But for sleeping at night this is the BEST. Porta crib sheets fit right onto it too. It doenst come with music or anything but your newborn doenst need that for quite a few weeks. It has great storage underneath it aswell."
162110,2,"This tub was a big disappointment. It leaked the first time we used it. We ended up buying a simple one-piece tub. The two-piece design sounded like a good idea, but it was almost impossible to engage the locking tabs, and the gasket didn't hold up."
166707,0,"Pampers were the best, until they changed the diapers and put velcro straps on the diapers. I liked the other type better that were not stretchy."
42176,1,"I needed a hamper for my baby's clothes. I can't believe how many clothes he goes through. I did not want those tacky ones that were out there. I noticed this beautiful folding hamper and fell in love. It looks great in the Nursery. The easy flip top is wonderful. The pull out netting makes you love this product even more. If you are looking for a hamper that is easy to use and looks good too, this is it! I love it!"
62891,1,"Originally I wanted to buy another type of diaper pail, one that uses regular bags. I recieved the Genie as a gift and I'm so glad I did. What makes the Genie different is the bags. They are scented andd thicker then normal bags to contain the odors. The only change I would make is to have the whole system a little larger, but it does hold about a weeks worth of diapers. I find it simple to use several times a day and easy to refill about every three weeks. The refills usually cost on average $4.50. I have never used any other diaper system, and will recommend the Genie to others. In facT, I have already given one as a gift."
56418,2,These simply don't fit a Thermador Professional Range. Your stove needs removable knobs as well as a flat surface under the knobs for these to adhere.
52903,2,"This chair is AWESOME for a newborn. It's big and soft and we thought that it was so cute that we had to prop our daughter up with rolled up blankets or lay her down sideways. The music isn't to annoying, and it shuts off in a decent amount of time.But then, like everything else... The newborn stage ends... And this chair loses MAJOR points. My daughter isn't quite 3 months old and the straps are at their largest point and they barely fit around her. There aren't toys to look at and she can't make herself bounce. It's now sitting in the dining room and my cat uses it for a bed.This was the first thing that I bought when I found out that I was pregnant. I just KNEW that I wanted to have it. Now I wish I would have bought one that a) she could make bounce and b) had a toy bar for her to interact with. If she would have stayed small forever, this chair would be perfect. Personally, I think it's a bit to much for the use that you will get out of it."
175919,0,"so my husband and i originally got the Moby wrap, which we love, but decided to look for something quicker to put on and could be more on the go, so we got this k-tan. its pretty good except that since it is already ""assembled"" you cannot control the sizing, esp when it stretches out. so, i am 5'4"", 115 and the xsmall is too big on me, so i prefer using the moby since i can control the tightness of it. my husband uses the k-tan and it fits it perfect, esp while the munchkin is a newborn. maybe ill be able to use it when hes bigger..."
184557,1,This is a great product its worth every penny. I put it around my coffee table and now I dont have to worry about my 7 month old bumping her head.
117554,1,i love this jumper and my baby loves it too she fell asleep in it couple of times which is good cause i have to carry her in my arms all day long. This jumper brought some relief and i finally can do something.The only drawback is that my baby girl is 4.5 months old ang weights 13 pounds and 13 oz and it is too big for her and sometimes her arm gets into the leg opening.
133438,2,"These bottles, which are obviously selling well because of the Bisphenol-A issues, leak like crazy. All you have to do is tip the bottle sideways and the milk comes gushing out like crazy. Makes a huge and annoying sticky mess. My advice, if you must absolutely have these, is to use the Avent nipples on these bottles. They fit and they don't leak at all, even upside-down. The silicone nipple is not implicated in the Bisphenol problems. The Born Free bottles also have a silicone gasket and a plastic insert, making cleaning and filling the bottles very frustrating and unnecessarily complex. I am hoping someone else comes up with a better BSA-free bottle because these are just not working for me."
184245,1,"This sleeper is awsome. My daughter is 4 weeks old and sleeps 7.5 hour stretches in it. I can pick her up and breast feed her and put her right back down, I think all the lack of moving around helps her get right back to sleep. She is right there with me al night and sleeps sooo soundly. Maybe it is the ""4th trimester"" feeling that helps her to be so calm. Whats great is that she sleeps the same way in it for day time naps without me there in bed with her. A must have!"
15773,1,I am so glad I bought this after moving to Colorado. Perfect for short transport to and from car in the cold Colorado weather. Keeps our little one nice and cozy.
137105,0,"I purchased these for our newborn since she was using the soothie pacifier. These were the first bottles she used, and I loved how convenient they were. We took a long road trip and the little canister that attaches to the bottom and holds the formula made bottle making so easy! Unfortunately, these gave our baby bad tummy aches. She had extremely frequent gas as well. We decided to try a different bottle, and within one day her issues were gone and she was the happiest baby. She still is! Also, the nipples are so large, they rub on the babies nose while feeding. So, for convenience, they are wonderful, but for the little bellies, not so great. I would not recommend them."
169547,1,Perfect for a dad ( or mom) who doesn't want to carry around a girly diaper bag. Strap is nice and long to better fit a man's build. Plenty of room inside & front pockets are a good size.
61362,2,"I ordered this monitor to replace one that we misplaced when we traveled to my in-law's house. I got it and set it up, and it didn't even work! I spent hours on the phone with the Safety 1st costumer service, who told me it was probably my Wi-Fi that was interfering with it. Really?!? Don't you think it would be a problem to sell a monitor that doesn't work if you have Wi-Fi? Also, there was no static or anything. I shut down the Wi-Fi and tried again, still no luck. It was just defective. I contacted the seller through Amazon and they did give me a refund. If you get a defective one like I did, don't try to work with their customer service! It will just infuriate you! I guess I'll go buy a different monitor now."
132931,2,"I totally don't get how the other folks are getting odor-free use out of this product. When my baby was very young, his diapers weren't that smelly to begin with, but now that he is on solids at 13mos., I have to keep this pail inside the closet and change the bag every night to keep his room odor-free. Also the front door latch is constantly loosening, so the front door is often found in a slightly open position (also the baby has figured out how to open it, yet another reason to keep it in the closet). If you look at the construction, there is no way this is sealed well enough to function as described. Unfortunately, I will need to toss this diaper pail and buy another product."
78438,0,"This booster worked great until my little guy was 11 months because the tray is not adjustable, it was too tight on our son's tummy. We will save it for when we need just the booster without the tray but until then we are purchasing a different booster to travel with us."
97416,1,"If you are working or in school full-time like me, this is the perfect pump! It uses the same motor as Medela with a wider range of power than Medela and its professional looking leatherette carrying case looks like a briefcase and has it all. The power cord is extra long if you need to pump in a bathroom stall like I had to occasionally.Medela thinks it can charge everyone big bucks because it thinks its the only brand with a good reputation. Think again - they are overcharging and The First Years is better for less $$!"
168271,1,I have tried several different brands of diapers and I like pampers the best. They have not failed us as far as leaking out the sides or top. My baby never gets a rash from them.
77373,1,"This swing is super cute! It swings in 3 different directions, has lights, music and a mobile. It has a buckle so you can buckle your baby in and a support pillow. Although the pillow was a little big for my newborn I still had to add my Kiddopotamus head and body support pillow. She loves sleeping in the swing more than her bassinet or crib. My only complaint is the motor makes a frog like sound when it moves, and after about 7 weeks now it's started to squeak a little bit."
17161,0,"We started using this monitor when my son was about 3 months old. It worked really well for a few months. Then the picture quality kept getting worse and worse, despite trying to change locations, etc. Now after about 9 months of using it, the picture tube must have gone bad because we can't get a picture at all, just a black screen. The sound has always been only OK, so we used a regular monitor for sound. Very disappointed that this doesn't work anymore because we got used to having it."
21039,1,"This is a great carseat for a decent price! I bought this seat for my 2 yr old daughter last fall. I had a Evenflo Triumph and we were going to be going on a plane trip and didn't want to lug the heavy seat around....this seat is nice and light! My daughter loves it and was totally comfortable on the first 5 hr flight and the second 6 hour flight. We even used it in the terminal as a place for her to sit! I have had no problems installing it securely either in the airplane or in any of our cars, with or without latch. It does not budge not one inch and doesn't seem to be top heavy if installed correctly as some other consumers have stated. I do agree that it is a pain if you have to take the cover off to wash, but its no big deal. We love this seat!"
169386,0,"The blanket, bed skirt and sheet look beautiful but the bumpers are too long and don't properly fit sides of the crib."
143684,1,If you're reading reviews on this product then stop and place the order. You will not regreat it. This is perfect. I haven't met a Kiddopotamus product that I don't like. Your babies skin will thank you for this product. It fits perfect on the Chicco travel stroller and stays on when you fold the stroller up. A MUST HAVE in my book!
60946,1,"This is a very practical item. Twisting it after disposing each diaper really helps to eliminate the stink. Newborn diapers require changing it a couple times a week, but otherwise, it's simple, easy and oderless. I love it."
145591,1,"I like how quickly my gift arrived, howerver the baby isn't born yet, a few more weeks to go! I've seen how it works though! Thanks for the quick response to my order! Ginny Meyer"
175246,0,"These are okay. But, a few times in the dish washer and they are starting to change shape. Because of that it makes it really hard to get the lid on the bowls. I use the bowls to take food to daycare and to feed my son at home. But I am having a hard time now getting the lids on them for daycare so I will have to find another route for his food.There are four bowls and four lids, but one lid has holes in it for microwaving."
123461,1,This item was at our house withing 20 hours. We could not believe how fast it was shipped.
146920,1,I love this mat! Its a little pricy but so worth the extra money. It doesn't have all those bad chemicals the cheap ones do and doesn't smell at all. Not to mention STYLISH! Its not as bright as in the pictures so don't be fooled but it has beautiful colors none the less. I love all the different configurations you can do by swapping out the middles of each tile and like how the packaging shows different configurations so you don't have to try figuring it out. My daughter loves it and I saved myself from many tears as she was learning to crawl or even just sit up on hardwood floors. I'm considering on buying another to make the area even larger. Love this playspot and so does my 10 month old daughter.
117332,1,"I like this gate for a variety of reasons. It looks lovely, works smoothly and is tall enough to discourage my dog from standing on it with her front legs.My main complaint--I found the installation instructions difficult to decipher. I'm pretty handy and it took me quite a while to figure out how to set this up.Only had it for a week so far so can't comment on the durability."
6611,2,"They changed the design of the Cruisers diapers. We used to buy Pampers Baby-Dry diapers for day use and Cruisers for night use. The Baby-Dry diapers couldn't hold in the wetness all night long but worked great for day use and were cheaper than the Cruisers. Now the new Cruisers can no longer hold in the wetness all night either. We no longer see the advantage of buying the Cruisers over the Baby-Dry diapers. We haven't experienced the diaper rash issue that others have. We'll continue to buy the Baby-Dry diapers for now, but we won't buy the Cruisers anymore. I don't know why companies feel the need to mess with a great product. I'm sure it was another bad marketing department decision. They always have to change things to make themselves appear useful..."
181156,1,"I purchased this item as a gift for a new born baby. My daughter received it as a gift for her baby boy. He loves to lie on the mat and look up at the various hanging animals. He is now reaching, swinging, and batting them. He loves the musical sounds and lights. It's a great item."
184530,1,"This has adapted well to restaurant high chairs and carts. The material is very attractive, and it wipes clean easily. Worth the price IF you use it a lot (I often forget to use ours!)."
35763,0,"I agree that its great for strollers, But not for the car seats, if your baby 10lb and up, its almost impossible to fit him in, the straps are not long enough, in the car he gets too hut and outside he still needs a worm shirt since you can't cover his shoulders with this bundle."
130386,0,We found this swing very comfortable for my daughter. She just looked so snug. The swing seems to like hug her. The problem we found was that 1. The music and the rotating mobile doesnt last long. You have to keep getting up to reset it. 2. The batteries dont last long either. You cannot even let the batteries get low because the music gets all warped and pitchy. What I did is put the Oceans Aquirium Crib Soother next to the swing and played that music instead. The music lasts longer and you dont have to change the batteries as often.
22200,2,"Hoped that this would save me steps--but just tried it and milked leaked everywhere (including my clothes, floor, table). Boo! Love the idea, but this isn't a helpful product."
118893,1,"We just received this item.Assembly was easy, almost didn't require the instructions. The chair is sturdy and safe. Our grandson now fits nicely at the dining table. This is not high end furniture, but then again, it was bought online at a good price."
57462,0,"Our newborn loved the seat, probably feeling snug and being reminded of life in the womb. However, it is important to note that the baby's spine and neck are cramped in this seat and given no room to grow, Especially when a baby is growing so much, we really wanted to avoid that so we stopped using the seat."
95137,1,"My baby isn't drinking milk from the breast, she does not latch on, so I have to pump and give her a bottle. This is the second pump I have gotten and I LOVE IT. it is quick and very effective in keeping up my milk supply. I highly recommend it!Mary"
45245,1,"We got this activity mat for our now 2 year old daughter, and are using the exact same one for our new son. It's lasted through 2 children (and our daughter loves to lay on it next to her brother and ""show him"" how to play with it). Our son can stay occupied for quite a while on the mat and I love having a place on the floor to put him to play."
159579,1,"This is my absolute favorite baby item. My son loves to watch the fish move around and kiss. He smiles and kicks the dangling fish....When he does that it makes a noise. ie. Cause and Effect! It also has a vibrating seat which he needs w/ his colick. You can put just the muical show or the vibrating seat on, you don't have to put both on at the same time. Please get this."
62785,1,My diaper genie has worked wonderfully so far - I've had it over 2 years. My husband is picky about bad smells and this has kept the odors away. It is very easy to use and I can't see why other folks can't figure out how to use it. My only gripe is that the hinges on the lid have broken on mine and I have to repair them now.
113976,0,"I just started using this for my 9 month old only b/c she started not wanting to sit in the original high chair we have (Fisher Price Space Saver). We had purchased this as a travel high chair to take with us to dinner at other people's homes. For that purpose it definitely is very useful - easy to collapse, carry and install.However, for every day use, I think it is just OK. I find that it sits too low, even on the highest setting. The tray is lower than our table level (vs. the Space Saver where it was about the same level). This is particularly frustrating for me b/c we have a dog who is now able to put his chin on the high chair tray.The dishwasher safe tray (white one) does not seem to snap on well so my baby keeps playing with it and is able to totally pull it off. As a result, I just stopped using it and directly use the blue tray. I personally find that it is a bit hard to snap the tray on and off.I don't think this would be easy to use for a baby first learning to sit in the high chair unless your baby already sits unsupported pretty well. The seat back is very upright and does not recline. It is also a hard seat with no padding."
61306,2,"I got the diaper genie as a gift and I have to say I am really disappointed. If you want a place to put the diapers, this is fine. If you want a place to put diapers that will also keep the room from smelling bad, don't get this product. Not only could I still smell the crap in the diapers, but the genie refills were scented, and the smell makes me sick. It seems like the makers tried to make it smell good, but it just smells like a tacky candle. I had to move it into the guest bathroom because it made my sons room stink, and now the bathroom stinks. I am in the process of looking for something else.Not only was it not good for odors, but it was also tough to empty. The way it works is that it has this thing on the lid that you twist to seal off each individual diaper. Then when it is full, you twist the lid and hold down a button that activates a razor that is suppose to cut the bag. The button is really hard to hold down, and in the year that I have owned it I have never had it actually cut all the way through the bag. I have always ended up using scissors. Then when it does cut it, the bag drops down into the genie, and unwraps the diaper that you just sealed. and then you end up putting the diaper back in and tying a knot in it, which is no big deal, except the fact that you have to tough the bags and then your hand smells like cheap potpurri all day long.Please dont buy this product. I am trying to find another one."
42097,1,"My son is quite grown up for a bottle yet he won't take a sippy cup or any kind of cup for that matter. I purchased one of these cups a month ago from my local super store as I liked the silicon spout and decided to give it a try too. To my surprise he liked this one and started drinking from it instantly. That's why I decided to buy another one.Just out of curiosity I started reading the reviews and saw many people complaining of leaking.I think I know the solution...the first time I put together all the parts of the cup, it leaked badly but I was able to figure out the reason after a few minutes of inspection. The trick is in putting the parts together. While assembling try to attach the holder to the spout part. There are two grooves on the inner side of the holder which fit perfectly to the two projections on the ring. Once done attach the assembly to the bottle. It should stop leaking.I am happy to find these cups as finally we can think of leaving our bottles behind.UPDATE 11/28/2012i received the product yesterday and slightly disappointed to see it actually is different from the nuby cup i already have given the fact that i paid the same price. it doesn't have the measurement markings as the other one has and is smaller in size (2 oz less). the spout portion has tow parts while the previous one has three (and the groove thing i explained earlier). but the holder-ring assembly have two projected parts and the spout, two groves to fit in, and when fitted properly it doesn't leak, so not bad at all. only thing is i have a better cup than this one from the same manufacturer."
39017,1,"I love, love, love this product. On the day that I received it, I tried it out right away. I have a Jeep Cherokee lightweight stroller and the sunshade fits perfectly! I can imagine how it would fit perfect on other strollers, too, since it is so adjustable with the attached straps. The material is so soft and strechy. I was a little worried that the screen would be a little bit dark for my baby to look through, since it is black, but it didn't bother him at all. He can still see what's going on around him. I also love the versatility of this sunshade. You can use it as a canopy, or you can use it to cover the entire stroller. I used it both ways, and it was very easy to do. With this sunshade, I feel confident taking my baby for his walks, even when it is really sunny outside. It also protects him from the bugs. It does look a little bit like an amish buggy, but that doesn't bother me. I know my baby is protected and that's all that counts. I would just make one suggestion to improve this product. Maybe the company could offer it in different colors - for example red, orange, green, and light blue - or have fun patterns on the darker materials to brighten them up a little. The sunshade also held up real well on a windy day and stayed in place. When you're done using it, it folds up small into the storage pouch that came with it. If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would have. I highly recommend it."
70104,1,"We have been using this monitor for the past 2 months (our little one is 3 months) and have had no problems with it. It is a must-have! It's very sensitive, as I can hear every little whimper. It's been perfect for our needs. I like the fact that it's portable and vibrates. Both a plus."
124011,1,I got a baby trend flex lock car seat from a friend so I purchased this item. I used it in the house and today the first time on the street. The steering is not perfect but good enough. (today is the 2nd day after receiving it) I just don't have 100% confidence on the red support tabs. My car seat barely stands on one of them and not touch any others.The assemble is really easy.
171608,0,"This tub seemed excellent for my preemie baby girl. The removable hammock really was a terrific and secure way to bathe her quickly and easily. My daughter HATED taking a bath until she was 6 mths old, so we usually had a struggle and the hammock gave me some After she outgrew the hammock, it was time to move on to a bath seat. This tub is strangely designed in my opinion. Not much room for baby to play and that &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; in the middle tends to get in the way. The tub has a positive side, but overall, I wouldnt waste the money."
180543,0,"I love the compartments and the colors of the bag! The camo looks super cool. BUT the material is pretty cheap, i thought it looked like canvas, but it is more of a nylon. Thats my only complaint."
101341,1,This bedding is gorgeous. I was looking for something for a girl that she could grow into. Not something that screamed baby. This is cute yet will last a few years to come. The picutres do not do this set justice you have to see it in person. I pulled many colors from the bedding not just pink. I am very happy.
39658,1,"We used these for our first child who didn't like to be swaddled. Now with our second, we were trying to figure out how to use them but still swaddle her (she's too big for the Halo sleep sak swaddler). What we've been doing is putting a light long sleeve onsie on her then the sleep sak then the swaddler and it works great and she hasn't been getting too warm (we're using the cotton sleep sak."
136936,1,"I use my Infantino Shop&Dine Deluxe - Happy Hula all the time. It is easy to put in the shoping cart, as well as the resturaunt high chairs. It completely surrounds my son protecting him from germs. It also entertains him by holding his toys. I think it was a great purchase."
52863,1,"I wasn't comfortable placing my newborn daughter in her other bouncy seats at first, so I placed her in the papasan. What a comfortable chair for her! Her head and body are supported(I waited until she was a couple of weeks old), and she seems pleased. She hasn't taken to the vibration much yet, but it's a great way to have her wake time spent while I can do other things around the house, or entertain her without having to always hold her. Also, she has acid reflux, so after a feeding, I place her in the papasan for at least thirty minutes."
33535,0,well first off small... my one year old is taller then this gate. we bought to and our still using it on top of our old one. so in short get a messuring tape out before u buy. this is very sturdy but tight as 1st takes about a week to loosen then monovering is a brease.
70186,0,My son is potty training so I thought that it would be a good item to have. Its pretty pointless. It doesn't stay in the seat and has just got in the way. I would not buy it again. He has not had an accident while in the car so I do not know if it would stop the mess or not.
84792,1,"They work as they are designed to, but are even hard for parents and older kids to get into the doors. I would suggest ordering one package and trying it on one door first to see the first as our door knobs are smaller and these are difficult to turn, but the difficulty is better than hearing my teenagers complain that my toddler is entering their rooms and getting into unwanted areas of the house. So far they have not fallen off or broken yet."
101448,2,It gave both my daughters really dry scalp. We called Little Twig to talk to them and didn't even get a call back.
58480,1,"Can't live without it! This item is so unbelievably easy to use. I recommend this item to any parent that wants to save time or use their time doing something else, which is everyone! 2 minutes and you're done."
125871,2,"My sister-in-law gave me some gigantic boxes of these when my husband was laid off. So we put them on our daughter and she leaked the first day. And the second day. And the third day. She leaked almost every day! We used up all the diapers since we couldn't afford to buy different ones. Once we ran out we went back to using the cheap Parent's Choice diapers that we never have problems with.I gave this two stars because we use Huggies Overnites with no problems. I don't know how they make great overnight diapers and crappy daytime diapers, but whatever."
38510,1,I have had mine for over 4 years now and it has gone through 4 kids and still works GREAT!!! I rate this as one of the top things you need for your baby! I have never had any problem with mildew.
155106,1,The additional camera is a great addition. It allows us to monitor our 15 month old in her room and our newborn in our room. My only complaint is the interference when the monitor is near any other kind of wireless device. Other than that we are so happy we didn't have to go out and buy an entirely new monitor set. It was as easy as plugging in the second camera!
127834,1,We loved this monitor so much. Used it for 4 or 5 yrs and still works great. Good quality sound even at long range which was a must for us while working in the yard during nap time. Tried two other brands before we found this one and were happy we did.
65807,1,"These were awsome! Our doctor had requested my two month old to be on 3 tsp cereal in his bottle at night because it made things with him spitting up alot due to acid reflux a lot easier. When I put the cereal in his bottle with the level 1 nipples, the milk was thicker and my baby was screaming because he couldn't get none out. I know they say not to puncture nipples to make the flow stronger so having to do that was ruining alot of my sons bottle nipples..I was having to throw them away after doing it because I didn't want them getting mixed in with his regular ones used for just formula. We had found playtex nipples for cereal at Walmart, so I got a pack of them and a couple playtex bottles. I LOVE the playtex drop in's now but the cereal nipples just didn't do. He would take hours, sucking as hard as he could, to try and get some of the cereal out still so we would have to end up puncturing them nipples also. I finally found these on here and ordered them. The same night I used them on his bottle and it seemed as if the milk did flow a little fast but that might have been due to how hard he was sucking because he was hungry, I was just happy he was actually getting some cereal out of the bottle without us having to cut it. Overall these were great when it came to feeding an infant cereal with a bottle."
71854,1,"This is the best stroller I've ever owned. The only negative is that you can't use it forever. It's light weight, easy to fold and set up. The basket is very useful-large and easily accessible. The stroller handles all sorts of surfaces-gravel, concrete, bumps, carpeting, etc. It's a must have, much better than those bulky travel systems that everyone buys."
46788,0,"these are adorable letters, but don't miss that they are only a couple inches in size. i returned them because they sent his first letter w/o the other two, but nonetheless wanted letters that were the ""typical"" size you see in stores, about 6 inches."
98177,1,"I absolutely love the way this looks in my house. It was a little tough to get hung at exactly the right height. We also are still trying to figure out the right kind of pen to use to write on it. But we love the way it looks, and that it is portable - you're not stuck with where you keep your kids' measurements in the house."
99579,1,"I'd have to say exactly the same where my now 1 yr old twins are concerned. We started with Pampers Swaddlers and moved on to Baby Dry. We also tried Huggies and Seventh Generation. Nothing worked as well as the pampers. With one exception: we also found that Huggies Overnights, size 4 (which we started using when they were barely in size 3's so they wouldn't need a diaper change through the night) worked exceptionally well. The Huggies Overnights seem to hold more liquid than anything else."
161004,1,"This bag is exactly what I was hoping that it would be. It's sturdy, roomy, convenient, and cool. I registered us for this so that my husband would have a diaper bag that he would not only be willing to wear, but be excited to wear!!! He absolutely loves it and it makes him feel like the best and coolest daddy on the block!!!"
136532,0,"The product was packaged in 2 boxes once you opened the big box, which makes the beginning process of assembly a task. Overall the product is decent, but the holes for the hinges on the door are crooked. This causes the door to not close smoothly. The drawer rails were already in place on the wood, and one of the screws was not put in entirely which caused the top drawer to not close. We had to take the screw out and put a different one in. It looks nice when it's assembled, but assembly was troublesome and there were a few flawed craftmanship areas."
130495,2,I received this swing from a gift from my mother. She got this swing because all of the great reviews on this swing. In two weeks the motor stopped working. I returned it to the store (thank god I got the insurance). One week later the music stopped and then the motor again. I going to return the swing again to the store and find something else. The motor is loud (It's bad when you are trying to sleep). A lot of people said the swing is too fast however my baby enjoys it.If you decide to buy any swing buy the insurance with it. You might have a similar problem.
161690,2,"The tub is very roomy, but poorly constructed. The sling feature is a good idea, however when the tub is more than half full of water and my son turns his head to the side, water gets in his ears. Also, the bar that is used to help babies sit up crunched my son's little package. He was very uncomfortable sitting up and it was hard to clean his bottom. The tub also has a lot of crevices that make it hard to keep clean."
52744,0,"We registered for this infant seat because of it's comfy look &amp; the fabric wasn't an obnoxious color, and we received it as a gift when our son was about 1 month old. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be very baby friendly. I have to agree with the reviewer who said that the baby sits quite upright &amp; is held in by the straps only. My son also seems to hang in the pelvic harness (even now at 3 months). Although it's nice to have a place to seat him in, my son much prefers his Fisher Price Aquarium Take Along Swing since he has toys &amp; lights to look at &amp; his bottoom isn't hanging in place. The Papasan doesn't provide anything for him to look at or play with (except a bunny that blends with the seat). I just wish the swing's seat fabric wasn't so obnoxious, but I love that the swing has toys &amp; lights for him to look at. His swing is much more comfortable for him than the Papasan is. There are other bouncy seats made by Baby Bjorn &amp; Combi that have stylish fabric colors, and fun toys for the babies to look at &amp; play with (they just tend to be more pricey)."
88735,2,"We have LOVED Pampers - have used them exclusively for all 3 of our children until now. I just upped my almost two year old from Baby Dry 4's to size 5's, expecting no big change, just help with her volume increase. Something has definitely changed! I first noticed a new chemical-like smell I never smelled with any previous Pampers Baby Dry. Then my daughter quickly developed a diaper rash. This child has never had a diaper rash a day in her life before this. I was still hesitant to believe it really could be the Pampers (they're so great! no leaks! so cheap on Amazon! I've ALWAYS used them!), but finally bought some Seventh Generation diapers to try, and the diaper rash vanished. MAJOR BUMMER!!! Why ruin such a great product, P&G? So sad to cancel my Subscribe & Save sub for these... :-("
43331,0,"I really did like this stroller frame for my Graco Snugride 22 but in retrospect, I wish I hadn't bought it. The Graco Literider weighs less than 2 pounds more, carries the car seat every bit as well, has it's own shade for extra protection and a better cupholder(mine kept falling off, they arent attached very well to frame). The real plus is that it's useful even AFTER baby outgrows the infant seat as a secondary stroller. Economically, it just makes more sense. Something to think about.Graco Literider Stroller, Lively Dots"
124303,2,We used this for about a week before the baby figured out if she slides it to the side of the toilet it pops right off. It did not stay in one place and had to be positioned directly on the front of the toilet rather than the side. That made it very inconvenient.
181126,0,"My 3-month-old twins really do love the playmat, with all the different things to look at. However, the music and lights worked for about 30 seconds, then quit, even after battery changes. I have had similar quality problems with one of the Fisher Price mobiles. Given that the babies like it so much, and fewer noise-making toys in the nursery is fine with me, I'm not going to return it. However, I'm not going to be buying any more Fisher Price toys."
178094,1,"I bought this changing table a little weary of the other reviews about it being flimsy....afterall - it is inexpensive. However, I thought it was an excellent purchase. For my first child, I had a Pottery Barn changing table almost identical to this one in white. And I can honestly say that the quality was the same. The actual table part where the baby goes is very sturdy and I felt comfortable testing my 30 pound three year old on it. It's a great changing table, it looks just as it is in the picture, and it did not look or feel as cheap as the price tag by any means. With regard to assembly, my father put it together in 20 minutes with no glitches. An Excellent Purchase!!!"
2011,1,"I love these improved baby-dry diapers. The old version had only one problem - the unadjustable waist. Now they have fixed it and they feel very similar to the more expensive Cruisers! Perfect for my baby, never a leak. Byebye Huggies!"
5399,1,"I was so tired of leaks from my other cups. After a while, yes they do wear out. Now I'm talking them lasting almost 2 years before I had to get these! I am SO glad that I have back ups. So much cheaper than buying new cups!"
38335,1,"This is a &quot;must have&quot; item for newborns and new mothers!. While pregnant with my first baby I was very scare of the &quot;first baby bath&quot; experience, however, with the Safer Bather, my fears were gone!. My baby loves it, it keeps him comfortable and warm during the bath, so comfortable that he sleeps sometimes while I am bathing him!!. I use it in combination with the First Years Newborn to Toddler bathtub, the Safer Bather fits in it, by the way, I don't use the &quot;hammok&quot; that comes with the First Years bathtub because it is difficult to keep the baby warm. My &quot;tip&quot;- when I use it, I continously pour warm water over the top of the Safer Bather (part that is not &quot;under water&quot;, where baby's head rest), to also keep the back of his head warm. I also used the Safer Bather for the first few days after the baby was born, when only sponge baths are recommended, it was perfect to use over my bed!."
116015,1,"When shopping for a moses basket, I wanted one with the hood. This one is great for the price. I got mine for $45 at the store with the red bullseye. You will only use this for the first 3 months or so and this one is sturdy enough and well made for that purpose. The hood can be removed as it attaches with velcro and holds in place really well. Overall this is a great buy. If you want something more posh, you will have to spend $100-200, which is not really worth it since you will only use this basket for the first couple of months. It looks beautiful in pictures as well."
45230,1,My friend brought this over when her and her 5 month old son came to visit me and my 1 month old daughter. They laid on it together and both got something different out of it.I ran out and bought one and it has gotten so much use!! My daughter (now 6 months old) uses this everyday. She went from focusing on the mirror to playing with the toys and even though we bought other Gymni animals to add on she mostly plays with what came with it originally.Whenever we go anywhere with our daughter this comes with us. It folds easily and is light weight. I throw it over my shoulder and we are good to go! If you unsnap the arches they lay down and you can use the mat to change the baby or let her take a nap.We went to Florida for a week and packed this in a 26 inch suitcase with all of our clothes. It unfolded and reassembled easily. She did not even miss the rest of her toys at home. I do not know how we would travel to visit so much with out this toy.She plays independently on this so I have the chance to get a break. I really can not say one bad thing about this product!!
183554,1,"We love the bumbo, and saw this tray for it on-line (couldn't find in any store). We thought sine we liked the bumbo so much, this had to be designed just as well. Unfortunately, it's not. It's difficult to secure, especially when the baby is moving around, as they tend to do. After a couple of weeks, I've figured out a process to secure one side, the middle section, and then push in the other side so it attaches. Once it's on, though, it's great, and stays on. It helps keep the table clean and the tray is a good size for our 10 month old. Overall, I recommend it, if you can handle getting it attached."
3136,0,"This swaddle blanket WAS a lifesaver or so I thought. The concept is a GREAT concept but this particular material was the worst. My baby is a 'wriggler' and always manages to wriggle her little arms out of the blanket up to her face,which is worrisome at best because once the material is that stretched then the problem becomes two-fold either her hands wake her up or the material follows her hands to her face and now we have a suffocation hazard, or sometimes her hands will find the opening in the bottom of the blanket where the 'flaps' overlap. I found the cotton knit material to be more counterproductive than helpful and HIGHLY suggest the cotton flannel. I have the microfleece, but have yet to use it. I've had minimal problems with the cotton fleece, the material isn't the stretchiest. The only real problem I have with the overall design of the blanket is the velcro. I think this blanket, especially the cotton knit, would benefit from a larger area to fasten the velcro at, therefor making it a possibility for a tighter swaddle. Also, the tabs start to 'bend out' after just once wash, making it a scratching hazard if you don't watch yourself."
165063,2,We always bought members mark diapers (we were very happy with them) until we found out about amazon mom. So I thought pampers would be the best. Not so much. They're flimsy diapers. They were always showing his booty and always leaking.
24873,0,We purchased this gate to keep our two dogs out of the baby's room. It took them about a week to figure out how to open it. We come home and the removable pedal is pulled off and the gate is wide open. This defeats the purpose. The gate is durable and easy to install but I wish I had purchased the more expensive gate without the foot pedal.
154344,2,"We bought these wipes cause they are environmentally friendly and chlorine free. They certainly are an environmentally safe product but I have my doubts about being alcohol free. It has some stinging effect cause my poor baby would scream everytime I used one of these. Also, they are dryer than competitive brands (earth's best) and so I would end up using twice as much. The wipes also have some distinct (read weird) smell, they certaintly are not frangrance free like they claim. We read some nice reviews about Earth's best chlorine free wipes at diapers.com so I went & bought a refill pack from Babies-R-Us. Guess what, no more screaming baby at diaper change and I need only 2 wipes now where I used 4-5 of the 7th generation. Also, the earths best is truly frangrance free and my little one is comfortable so guess what our next order for wipes will be................."
120405,1,"I just put our 3 month old in his own bed, and there is no way that would have happened without this monitor! I worry too much about what could happen without him next to me to watch, but the peace of mind I have knowing that if anything causes him to stop breathing the alarm will tell is priceless. I happen to be very cheap. I try to get around spending money at all if I can help it. I've read others say this monitor is pricey, but I tell ya I would have paid $300 for the peace of mind it gives me! I sleep sounder. I don't have to get up every 20 minutes to check on the baby, I can just roll over and see that the monitor is working and go right back to sleep. Thanks to Bebe sounds for inventing this product.....I wouldn't sleep without it!!"
140806,0,We stepped our daughter up to these from the standard silicone SLOW flow nipples. She took right to them and seemed to have NO issues getting the breastmilk out and ate her bottle in about 75% of the time it takes for the slow flow bottle. However. The FIRST time I tried to clean one of them the nipple ripped as soon as I put ANY pressure on it with the nipple brush. Because of the tri cut pattern it just continues the cut and rips right down the side of the nipple. We'll be trying the medium flow nipples instead.
134999,2,"I had a surprise baby after my twins were born. I had a top of the line twin stroller for my two year old twins and needed something affordable that would fit the twins and the newborn. I ordered this stroller and I was extremely disappointed. Part of it was sticking out of the box when it arrived. It was very heavy to push and as others said, the middle seat is very tight. In addition, it is very hard to push -- it pulls to the left quite significantly. It is worth spending the extra money in order to buy a stroller that is easy to push, and large enough to hold three children as they grow."
37570,2,"We've had this gate for a few months now. It started out great but now the latches mounted on the wall are coming apart. the gate regularly falls off it's hinges, yesterday it landed on my 6 yr ols bare toes!!! My year old can now tug it open even when in a locked position.So not worth the $$$. Keep looking if you want a gate that will last and be safe."
128981,1,"In my opinion, these are the best diapers on the market! We've tried Pampers & Huggies, both which leaked, even when we remembered to turn out the leak guard flaps & had a ""perfume"" smell that rivaled the presents my daughter left...We have yet to have a leak with these, and best of all, they don't have that fake perfume smell of some of the other diapers.My only regret is that they're not easy to find, but I've heard Trader Joe's carries them, as well as Wild Oats & maybe New Seasons--all stores that carry organic products. You can also find them on Amazon's website, by the case (224 count) or individual packs. They are not much more than the other brands, and for the No Leak & No Rash factors, I'd be willing to pay a whole lot more :) Besides, they're also good for the environment because they're not chorinated/bleached.Don't waste your money on any other brands. Use these and you won't be disappointed."
145042,1,"We love this stroller! When we were stroller shopping, I was single-minded about picking the carseat first and from there, the best stroller available to match. We decided on the Britax Companion infant seat and I still am 100% happy with our decision. Where we went wrong was underestimating the importance of a great stroller. The Buzz is far superior to the stroller we bought to match our Companion. The reasons it is better are things that I didn't understand the importance of before baby was here. I'm not even going to touch on how unbelievably sexy and innovative this new stroller is and as you can see from other reviews, it lives up to the hype. Here are the two reasons that have made me a believer:1) Comfortable seat. -- The buzz has thick, dense, cushy foam and hugs our little one like a dream. She is incredibly content in this seat which makes long walks fun again. Our other stroller has a canvas covered thick cardboard seat. I now understand why she was not happy in there for long.2) Sunshade is incredibly flexible and can keep the sun out of her eyes from any angle. -- I live in Seattle and this was a detail that didn't seem important to me pre-baby. I was wrong. The sunshade on our other stroller is short and inflexible. It worked great, as long as the sun was behind baby. When we turned to walk the other direction, I would need to use a blanket thrown over to shield her. Not the case with the Buzz. The sunshade is incredible, it can fold down flat to completely encase the baby if necessary.I'm not sure what I would have done differently from the beginning because I love our carseat and loved having a stroller frame to put the carseat on. But, now that we're at the stroller phase (5 months) I see incredible value in the buzz and am really happy to have one!"
25328,0,"This co-sleeper gets the job done. It is easy to assemble, works for our 16-inch height platform bed (with mattress), and has wheels and a small footprint that makes it easy for us to move it from room to room. But it has a few deficiencies. The mattress is a joke. It's an accordion piece of cardboard or similar that you can't elevate on one end if the baby has acid reflux or is congested. In fact, it's so flimsy and hard (even with a wool puddle pad that I bought for the co-sleeper) that I decided to swap out the mattress for a changing pad, which is fine for a newborn, but may become too constricting and potentially dangerous when baby is large enough to roll over because there is a 1-inch gap between the pad and the sides of the crib. There is no place to install a mobile, and there are no manufacturer options for a mobile."
81320,0,"Some of the items in this kit are great: soft baby toothbrush, medicine spoon, brush. Some are very outdated and hard to use: nail clippers, comb. The case is OK,but the items look cheaply made.There are better products on the market."
33073,2,"Although they seem helpful for certain situations, I wasn't too impressed. I'm still glad that I have them in case someday they prove helpful."
160830,2,"This product looks fabulous, has ample pockets, lays flat on the hip, trendy, cool. Upon reciept we were thrilled but upon inspection? The material is a scratchy sorty of vinyl-esque material. We were expecting a softer more supple nylon, similar to the nylon in higher end REI or LL Bean Gear (I mean, for the price we think the expectation was reasonable!) Instead the material is a stiff thin nylon, and the entire bag makes a crinkly sound when you touch it. I'm dating myself here but this bags material reminds me of cheap 80s parachute pants... This is the type of material you get when you get the free cosmetic case from Lancombe...Sadly we returned it and are still looking for another option. Too bad, because it LOOKS great. ~ Signed, wife of D. Butler..."
28199,2,"If you could give this bassinet 0 stars I would. I am so unhappy with it. The picture of it is very misleading. To start the lace does not go as far as it is shown in the picture and there is a warning label very large right in the front of the bassinet in orange and the lace does not cover it up either so it is the first thing you see on the bassinet. A really bad place to put the warning sign. It is sewed very well on there too, we were able to get it off thankfully. Also the music box feature with music and light and vibration is underneath the lace on the front. Which makes having the light pointless because with the light on under the lace you can not see the light even on. If this bassinet didn't cost so much for shipping and to ship it back I would send it back but it is not worth the money wasted. Please don't waste your money I can't see how anyone would be happy with this product."
146840,1,"I got this as a gift for a friend and he really liked the stickers and they hold very well to his tile wall (he put them up in the bathroom), but the stickers are folded inside a box, so some of the stickers and fold marks going right through them! And they haven't flattened out on the walls!"
41633,2,"I received this monitor set as a gift. One of the receivers didn't even work straight from the package. When I called customer support, they were so uncooperative and told me that since I didn't have the receipt, there were nothing they can do. That was the least of the problems we experienced with this monitor. The static it picks up is unbelievable! It would pick up the noise of our dryer so loudly that we always questions whether we hear the baby. Also, the whole set stopped working one night after a few weeks, so now we have to look for a new monitor set pronto!"
92218,2,"I am a mother of twins (2.5 weeks) and was recommended these bottles by our lactation consultant to promote breastfeeding and bottle feeding. These are horrible. First, as others have already written, they leak. They leak at the nipple area as well as the rim and I triple checked to ensure we were following directions appropriately. More of your breast milk ends up on your babies neck then in their mouth.Second, the last 1/2 oz of milk gets wasted due to poor bottle design.Third, our twin babies have more gassiness with these bottles than others. Save your money and time and skip this product. I am returning the bottles because they do not meet their label claims."
38302,1,"I have two of these gates - for the top and bottom of our stairs. They install quickly, and can be easily removed if needed. Yes, this gate can be used for stairs - even though it has tension bars. Wall cups are included, which are screwed into the wall, and then the discs on the ends of the tension bars sit very securely inside the wall cups - preventing the gate from being pushed over.The biggest caveat is this - there are certain measurements that don't always work perfectly with the included extensions. (read last paragraph for my story - skip if not interested) We have only had our gate up for a few days, currently I cannot open it one-handed. This may change with practice, I'll have to wait and see. In regards to the reviewer concerned with the latch - I just tried several times to hurt my finger in the sliding latch - and couldn't. Perhaps the latch has improved, or maybe my finger is just large enough. :)I purchased this gate in a set that included a 6"" & 12"" extension piece - for a maximum width of 52.5"". My stairway is 46.75"" - but the gate wouldn't fit securely. Why? Because with the 12"" extension, the gate's tension bars just barely reached (wiggled but wouldn't fall). With both the extensions, the gate's minimum width was 47.5"". Regalo's customer service was very helpful, and sold me the 4"" extension - which made it work perfectly. :)"
83857,0,"We have another one of these in the green color and LOVE it. We haven't had any problems with the material that it is made of and it has washed clean and not stained anywhere near as easily. For some reason the pink version is made from a thicker rubber that cracks easily and the suction cups get warped so that they do not stick to the table. I can't figure out why the two colors are so different, but I just wanted to pass on that the green version of the same product is WAY better quality. I have used two different pink ones and both of them have cracked and will not stick to the table as well. Works great as a placemat to give your kid a place that you can put food, but don't count on the little trough catching any food once it gets cracked on both sides. We have had the green one for longer, use it daily, and it still looks brand new. We have used the pink one a total of about 15 times and it looks like we have used it for years. I just wanted to pass on this info specifically about this color. I would give raving reviews about the product itself if they all worked like the green one!"
79560,1,This is a great way to remember those first year milestones. We've done one for each of our boys. They make great gifts too.
21782,2,This hamper looks very nice and pretty. It is the worst thing ever. It looks great until you wash it. It shrinks up to half of the size and it looks terrible. It does not wash well and I ended up having to get a new one. It is not sturdy and is mainly for show only. Heavy users will not be satisfied.
173135,0,"It doesn't really stop the dents from getting into my leather seats, but it does stop the juice and crackers from getting on my seat."
39883,1,"I bought one of these in late 2007 for my infant daughter to sleep to. She's almost 4 now and it has worked like a charm every night in between for her. The sounds do sound a little computer-y, but it doesn't matter - they still sound like what they're supposed to sound like. Maybe the people complaining got defective devices, but I don't want my kids' ears blown out. It gets plenty loud enough. Also, ever since she was 2, my kid has dragged this thing around the house as a toy many times (it also runs on batteries, and the batteries last a really long time), and it seems to be indestructible. I'm buying another one right now for my newest addition, and I don't expect any problem with it. I will update this review after I get the new one."
163654,1,"There was always someting I hated about the high chairs I've had in the past, but this one is great! It's small so it doesn't take up a lot of room and will fit any chair. It's easy to clean, the easiest I have ever had to clean. It's sturdy, it wont fall off the chair-no way. It is super comfortable! My baby could sit in it all day and play if I let him. The tray goes on and off easy, and it's dish washer safe. The tray isn't big and bulky like all the others I've had.Not only is it the best high chair I have ever owned, it's the best booster seat I have ever owned as well! Before I had my 4th baby I took it out of the box and used it for my 3 year old. He already had a booster, but I hated it! It was always faling off the chair and my son would get hurt. There is nothing I don't like about this high chair!!!!!!"
49532,1,"We read the reviews and happend to find this along with the two exstentions at our local open box/overstock store unopend we paid about $25.00 for both! I bought a tadpole play mat for the bottom agian at a overstock store and he loves to roll around and play in it. these are sturdy and well worth the full price. only downside is it does not have a door. but the play yards with doors are not as sturdy so it's give and take. The best part is i know he can't get into anything so i can clean, and do the things i need to while he plays and explores saftly!"
5537,1,"This is very easy to Velcro onto the side of the crib. Has a spot for a box of wipes, to small mesh compartments as well as 4 other places to put things and a diaper stacker in the middle. The problem I did run into was that the newborn diapers I would put in would just fall out through the opening which was frustrating but I got a clothes pin and pined the two sides together and it works fine now"
139242,1,"This had everyone going WOW when my daughter opened this for her birthday. I got to admit i love it so much I don't mind laying on the floor during the night looking up at the stars with my daughter at all, very peaceful and amazing. Very good thing to do for ""quiet"" time before bed. My daughter was scared of it the 1st night so we had to turn it off but the next day during day time i taught her how to push the buttons and change the colors and she started playing with it more than when night came i turned off the lights and had her turn it on herself and change the colors how she wanted it and she finally enjoyed looking at the stars and is no longer scared of it. She now loves doing this every night and goes ""WOW"" every time. she also likes having the stars shine on her body like in her hand and try to grab them. My daughter by the way is 2 :) VERY VERY happy with this product!"
158343,0,"I ordered these for my 2 year old, to go over his diaper at night because he often 'leaks' through his night time diaper. I put this on him and checked him in the middle of the night and he had already leaked through and had red marks on his legs from the elastic. I was not impressed and ended up throwing them out."
31329,1,"I absolutely love this drying rack. It holds so much, but is not too bulky to sit on my counter. It doesn't exactly spin around very easily, but it doesn't really bother me too much. I love that I can take my bottles, nipples and tops right from the dishwasher and hang them on this rack to dry until I'm ready to make bottles. I would definitely recommend this product especially for the price."
41001,2,I have used Pampers brand since my baby was born and they were great. She is now 17 months and the new change is just horrible. They leak and give her the worst rash. She actually has sores on her bottom! The rash is so bad that it is now speading to her legs. I would be very leary about purchasing these diapers. My daughter does not have sensitive skin and we have not changed anything. The only thing that changed was the makeup of the diaper itself. I must say they not only cause rashes but they are so CHEAP!!! I will never use again unless they change back to the orignal diapers.
127372,1,"I have purchased this Crib twice now. Once five years ago for my oldest in honey oak and again this year for my youngest in espresso. I loved the crib then and am still loving it now. It is sturdy enough to grow with my kids for many years and the finishes are beautiful. I have never worried that my kids will knock over, break or shake apart the crib even when they are at their wildest.For people who are picky about dents and scratches on the surface of the wood, this is probably not the crib for you...However, you will not like ANY crib around this price. The Kalani crib, like all cribs around this price, is a softwood crib and shows wear very very easily. Hardwood cribs wear better but are also A LOT more expensive. Personally, for the price difference I can handle the teeth marks and scratches.Amazon did a wonderful job shipping the crib. It was here within 8 days using the free super savers shipping and not a single problem when we opened the box.The instructions are really very simple. 45 minutes was all it took to get everything out of the box and together.This is really a wonderful crib for the price."
135417,2,After 4 months it just broke. Also it was also very noisy. Just garbage! Do yourself a favor and buy anything else.
119129,0,"This pillow is a wonderful concept.. but it just did not work for me. I have several cons..My daughter had latching problems and for the first 6 weeks would only latch in the ""football"" position. So, it made this pillow impossible to use for the first six weeks. After that, she latched on normally and I again tried to use this pillow, but found that it put baby up to high for me. Maybe it was because I was used to just a traditional pillow, but I did not like this pillow.I nursed my daughter for 17 months.. and in my opinion.. save your money - a regular pillow works just as well if not better. Like I mentioned, wonderful concept, but I was one of the women who these pillows did not work for.. so something to consider before purchasing this pillow!"
142176,0,"I purchased the Bjorn Active and it was great. But when my son reached 15lbs and up it became uncomfortable and painful to wear. Finally when he hit 20lbs we went with the Ergo which is a lifesaver! The Bjorn was nice because it kept my son close to my body and when he could hold his head up he loved facing forward. Again, it was fine at first but it was a bit expensive. There are tons of baby carriers and slings that are worth looking into."
4332,1,"This stroller organizer is AWESOME! I have room for baby's bottle, my water, keys, cell phone, paci, toys and MORE! Its just so helpful! I use it on my Pliko P3 and it works perfectly fine. I've seen peoples comments that it slides to an angle but I havent found that at all. Totally recommend this product!"
174265,0,"This didn't fit my playpen. I have a joovy ultralight, and it just make the sides curl up. It did provide some extra cushion"
11172,1,"I am very pleased with this pack 'n play. We used it as a crib for the first month and are now using it as a secondary sleep place. While it can be challenging to set up and take down, the instructions are very clear and after a few attempts, it will come naturally. This PnP is much sturdier than another playard (BabyTrend) we borrowed for a weekend trip. The only complaint I have is that the changing table and mobile don't fit in the storage bag. While I could care less about bringing the mobile on vacation, it would be nice if the changing table would fit (hence 4 instead of 5 stars). Also, it is worth noting that the changing table pieces are difficult to take apart. Overall good, sturdy PnP--I would highly recommend.Update April 2011: I used this for baby #2 and it is still working well. We've taken it all around the world so it has had its fair share of baggage handler tossing--it is still sturdy. Love it.Update December 2012: I am still using this product for baby #3. It has held up well, but the bassinet feature is starting to sag a little. But, after 3 being used three times, I would say this thing is quite durable."
75241,1,"I am very pleased with this purchase. With my other children I used a manual pump and had ok results. I was able to have a back up supply of breast milk for emergencies but it never seemed like enough. With this pregnancy I decided to try an electric pump but did not want to spend over $200. I did my research and read many reviews. The Lansinoh pump was VERY well priced and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive so I decided to take my chances. I am so happy I purchased it (actually it was a present from my Mom)! I was able to cut the time I used to spend pumping manually in half because you can do both breasts at once. It is adjustable so I was able to find a speed and suction strength that was comfortable and effective. I can not provide any opinions on how effective it would be for those moms who would need to pump multiple times daily, but for occasional, once a day pumping I think it would work perfectly."
118764,1,I really like this portable high chair. It is very compact for traveling and I like using it at restaurants. Highly recommend it.
158877,1,"Okay, I've never experienced a colicky baby before (until recently) but my daughter was happy using these. For the first week, I was mixing 1/2 breast/formula. I never had any problems cleaning these bottles. However, switching to breast full time and sometimes bottling to feed while out in public, I notice the nipples do get ""filmy"". I tried just about everything to get them clean but, still kind of cloudiness to them. Then yesterday, I broke down and bought the Dr. Brown bottle cleaner! OMG! LOVE IT! I simply put the nipples in a pot with a tiny squirt of dish soap and boiled them a bit, took them out and used the nipple cleaner on them...they are all sparkly and clean (like NEW!). I just bought some Level 2's yesterday as she is now 5 months old and we are still bottling her milk and giving to her along with sippy cups filled with water. The hubby doesn't want her to use sippy for milk...? Don't ask me, that's another ""issue""! But, she loves her Dr. Browns. Oh, and I tried to fake her out with her ""emergency AVENT bottle"" kit in the car....uh...screaming was not something I expected. The look she gave me was ""What the heck is WRONG with this bottle and why does the milk taste FUNK? Are you mad at me mommy?"". My g/f who was with me laughed her butt off, she thought my daughter was brilliant! Me? I suffered the screaming until we got home to get her REGULAR bottle. *am noting to toss the avents as I type this*Recently, my same g/f brought over her neighbors screaming colicky baby (which the neighbor brought over crying that she just needed alone time). I snuggled him up and brought him to my co-sleeper and turned EVERYTHING off...gave him the Dr. Brown bottle and he slept for over 1 1/2 hours. My g/f bought her neighbor a set and told her what I did. From what I hear, the baby is doing much better and the mother is now getting some sleep and definitely quiet.This is my first baby and if I do ever have another one, I will definitely use this product again, and again and again! As for the ""plastic causing cancer""...my Dr. is one of the originators of one of the top Pediatrics offices and if he swears by these bottles, I'm sold. Also, from what I have heard, giving breast milk to your babies reduces the chances of cancers in their futures. It's the best and my daughter deserves nothing BUT the BEST."
138225,1,"this toy is very easy and fun to use, can be used as a toy or lamp. my toddler loves watching the stars during the night, I like the fact it comes with 3 different colors, my girl loves chanching the colors.The only cons is batteries run out fast."
182925,0,My husband is a big cowboys fan so this seemed like a great idea for our little boy. First we tried to put it on the crib and it doesn't fit so we had to mount it on the wall (which has worked out fine) My only big complaint is that it really only plays for about 7 or 8 seconds after you wind it. The baby likes the music for the few seconds it's on but you could develop carpel tunnel winding the thing if you actually wanted to get it to play for a few minutes.
172372,1,"after reading the other 2 reviews I had to write in defense of this product. My baby loves it and it frees up my hand to wash baby better. It fits great in my tub. Baby sits safely and she is 6 months, weighs 20+ lbs and I have no trouble getting her in and out. I dont have to worry about her slipping. I love it we have used it many times with no accidents or pinches."
35275,1,"This lamp shade matches perfectly with the rest of the paisley set, and looks great in the room. It is a small shade, made for a child size lamp (which is perfect for a nursery). We have enjoyed it."
3669,2,"This book shelf did not last long at my home, I had to replace it after about one year. It started rocking from side to side after a few months and the books started leaning forward and falling out. Would not recommend it for homes with children under 5 years old."
12852,2,"The monitor has been sitting on my nightstand for some time as I had never been able to hear much aside from outside noises (television, washing machine, neighbors talking, etc.) or static from my own movement (breathing, an unsteady finger, growling stomach, you name it). I am now 38 weeks and decided to give it another try today. I heard a very faint heartbeat. I thought I could FINALLY record something via computer as suggested by the product to send a file to baby's grandparents in California. Even worse than hearing the static through the headphones is hearing the TREMENDOUS static and background noise after replaying the .wav on the computer. It even overshadowed the heartbeat which was inaudible on the playback. I am so extremely disappointed that I am considering writing a letter to Bebe Sounds about this bogus product. Please heed the warnings and save yourself the frustration of buying this ""monitor."""
102586,2,"I tend to think negative reviewers come from negative people, but this product really is shoddy. It looks great and operated beautifully for 3 weeks before the motor stopped working (i.e. the leaves stopped rotating and opening/closing; the music and light still work though). I threw out two sets of batteries assuming that was the problem.Choose a different mobile because chances are you won't have time to deal with the warranty or get a replacement mobile once your baby arrives... I wish I had heeded that advice from other reviewers."
76375,1,This product was very helpful to my husband and I when our son was born last December. It also gave me peace of mind when we started putting him in his own room to sleep when he was 2 months old. It works very well to keep babies from rolling over onto thier stomachs before they are able to turn their head to the side to prevent suffocation. But once they start rolling over the product isnt really usable any longer. I would definately give this as a shower gift.
9109,1,It is a perfect fit for the crib and safe from the baby getting to it. The shipment was sent immediately and packed very carefully.
34440,2,"What a shame! This monitor has beautiful picture and the crib mount is a fantastic idea. That being said, DO NOT BUY IF YOU RUN WIRELESS DEVICES IN YOUR HOME! We have both wireless internet and a cordless phone. Both the router and the phone work on 2.4 GHz, but they do not interfere with each other. All three channels on this monitor, however, caused major interference with all of our wireless devices. I called the company to see if there was anything we could do. The representative said that we would need to buy a new cordless phone and router that operate at a different band. She even cautioned me that many households with satellite TV experience interference. My research discovered that the majority of wireless devices currently operate on the 2.4 GHz frequency. I don't understand why Safety 1st didn't put this otherwise fabulous monitor on the 900 MHz band, like all of their other video monitors. The bottom line... DON'T BUY THIS MONITOR IF YOU HAVE WIRELESS DEVICES OR SATELLITE TV IN YOUR HOME. It hurt me to take it back, but this monitor just isn't compatible with today's wireless home.One other complaint I have with the monitor, is that you can only view it straight on. You loose the picture at ANY other angle. High price for a cheap LCD and limited frequency modulation."
139043,1,"My daughter's eyes are very light sensitive so a conventional nightlight was too bright. I saw this turtle after browsing thousands online. I ordered it, and my daughter loves it. She is almost five years old. This night night turtle is safe alternative for kids who like to try to unplug light from outlet. She can easily turn turtle on and off with a button. She is very happy. Upon receipt of the turtle, it appeared to have a brown shell, she frowned, but when we turned it on, it shined blue, green and orange/amber separately. It is a soft light and the stars appear on every wall. This was a great buy, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cool nightlight for their kids. Well worth 30 dollars."
101869,0,its Very SMALL... great for sleep overs but not for everyday use... I returned this and bought a bigger one. It is Very cute I wish they made the same one but bigger!
93129,1,"Wonderful for our little doggies that like to go camping, but don't like lying around in the dirt. With this they are comfortable, warm and dry.Great product!"
14121,2,"We used these bottles for our daughter over 3 years ago and they seemed to work fine. So, we purchased them again for our son, who is now 7 months, and they leak just about every time we very tightly seal the bottle. I would not recommend these bottles!!"
8198,1,"This color is very vibrant and that's what we wanted. It fit our changing table pad, which we also purchased through amazon. It looks great !"
145232,1,It was very easy to put together and my granddaughter just loves it! Plus the cost was reasonable.
159821,1,"I got an old bouncer at a garage sale, (no lights, no sound, no vibration). My son hated being in it. Then I saw him at the sitters in this bouncer, and he loved it. He was 2 months old when he would activate it on his own by kicking. He is now 4 months old and still likes to play in it. It is very supportive and comfortable, he often falls asleep in it after playing. Highly recommend this product."
9797,1,"This is the best potty chair! My son used it for the first time at 15 months and will still use it now at 2. It is the perfect size and he always looks very comfortable on it. It's easy to empty, easy to clean, and we almost never have a problem concerning the height of the splash guard. This is one of the best purchases I've made for him!"
107903,1,"I have had no problems at all with this pump and would recommend it to anyone who needs one for occasional use. It is quick, comfortable, and convenient. I prefer this one to the expensive double electric pump we rented for the first month."
29391,1,"Shortly after my son started sleeping through the night, he developed a horrible red, bumpy rash on his bottom that was so raw it made him cry in pain. We tried changing diaper brands, Aquaphor and Desitin for a week and it got worse. We also tried generic anti-fungal cream and leaving him without a diaper. Nothing worked for three weeks.I took him to his peditrician, who explained that it was a yeast rash, caused by extended contact of sensitive skin with a wet diaper during the night. Any diaper can cause this, not just those with Drymax or those for overnight use. Using a protective barrier before bedtime is the best way to prevent it.The doctor recommended Lotrimin Antifungal (AF) Cream three times a day (no other brand). For other diaper changes, gently clean off the baby's bottom and apply Caldasene on the raw spots (putting the powder on your hand first), then cover the whole area with eitherBoudreaux's Butt Paste, Diaper Rash Ointment, Tube 4 oz (113 g)orBalmex Diaper Rash Cream with Aloe & Vitamin E, 4 oz.The pain subsided right away with this three-step treatment and within 48 hours, the horrible rash is gone. Truly amazing."
25263,1,"Perfect for traveling or packing in the motorhome. For the price, it has alot to offer. It has bags on both sides of the stroller for snacks, moveable sunshades to really keep the sun out of their eyes. It's not the plushest stroller, however, for travel or quick errands it's perfect for us!"
166857,1,We used this especially during the winter since it is warm and it has been great. No worries about our daughter being cold yet we did have her wear a long sleeve shirt underneath since there is no sleeves. The material is very nice....super soft
58025,1,"I will first admit that there are additional parts to these cups that need to be washed, but since we used Dr. Brown's bottles, I was used to a few pieces.The soft spout on these cups is great, and made transitioning to a cup SO easy for us. My son hasn't taken a bottle since his first birthday, and never missed them a bit. There are two levels of spouts, one harder one softer. I've tried other soft spout brands, but have had leaking from the collars. Avent cups NEVER leak as long as the valves are inserted correctly. Our little guy will use any brand or spout type, but these are his favorite and nice on sore gums.I really recommend these cups despite the extra valve pieces (which I simply pop in the dishwasher in a basket). You'll never have spills on your sofa or carpet."
73898,1,"I absolutely LOVE this item! I bought it because as a first time mom, I knew I would try to keep up with everything and for the price, I thought, ""why not?""When I first got it and played around with it, I thought, well I MIGHT use it. Boy was that an understatement! Now ""ITZBEEN"" everywhere we have been! And I have found extra uses for it as well. For instance, I had a c-section and had to take med's for a few days and I used the ""spare"" button for that. Since I was breastfeeding and getting little sleep, it is sooo helpful because you really can't remember sometimes and writing it down is just more to do on a sleep-deprived brain. You can just put it in bed with you and glance at it when you need to. I also thought you could use it to time contractions as well!My baby is four weeks old now and I highly recommend this product and will keep using it!I don't use the alarms too much, but I could see myself using them if she has to take meds at some point. It takes a little time to remember to push the buttons, but once you get it, it is GREAT and so convenient!"
183602,0,"I have this in black and it works fine for what it is. It holds a pacifier, nothing more. However, mine corroded and rusted on the zipper parts. I don't want rust anywhere near something my child will put in his mouth so I'll be looking for an alternative. I never submerged it in water, only wiped clean. I expected higher quality from Skip Hop."
21309,1,"We bought this trampoline last year for my 6yr old son, who was then 5. He is now starting to grow out of it, but at the same time my 2yr old twins are getting into it. The twins are still kind of small for it, but I`m sure they will get a lot of use out of it when they get just a little bit older. For now we keep it folded up in the closet and pull it out on rainy days, or when my 4yr old nephew comes to visit. This is a great toy. I just wish I had bought it when my son was younger so he could have gotten more use out of it. I`m sure my twins will enjoy it just as much as he did."
66306,2,"We have several travel cases for toddler utensils - this case, and the utensils, are my least favorite. The tines on the fork are so wide that my 15-month-old can't stab anything with it. She does like the spoons. Because the handles on these utensils are a bit longer than most toddler utensils, it makes it easy for her to grab the handle of the spoon while I help guide the spoon to her mouth. The case is large and takes up too much space in our diaper bag, so we haven't used it outside our house. Like other reviewers, I could only get 6 of the 8 utensils in the case at the same time. For just a few dollars, the price is right since we use only the 4 spoons. I would trash the forks and find another use for the case. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
101136,1,"I buy these diapers for my two year old. And, I love them. They work great, and don't leak!"
135209,1,The Bugaboo Frog is the stroller we were looking for our newborn baby girl. Is fantastic. Easy to assemble and fold down for our small car trunk as well as its light weight make it completely functional.
3655,1,"The Playtex insulator cups are our favorite sippy cups by far, and we have tried many different cups. The no spill valves work well and store inside the lid. The insulating feature does not keep stuff cold for a long time but it is still WELL worth the extra money because it pretty much eliminates condensation which we all know is a real pain in the diaper bag, on furniture, etc. Some no spill cups require so much sucking power to actually get anything out of them that your kid looks like he's going to burst a blood vessel trying to drink his apple juice. Happily, that is not the case with these. They do require a bit of suck power but not so much that my kids find them frustrating and no spills makes for one very happy Mommy."
23812,0,"We got this and a another type of swaddle blanket at our baby shower. After using both types for a few weeks now we have found this one is OK but nothing special. Baby can wiggle out without too much difficulty, no matter how careful I am to wrap him. The other swaddle blanket (Miracle Blanket) is MUCH better. I suppose if you have a baby that isn't very strong or doesn't move around much this would be fine."
107264,1,"I work at a store that sells Diaper genies, and they are ALWAYS being returned due to people unable to use them, they were so complicated. So I knew I did not want that. I went with the diaper champ and I love it! So easy to use, I can use kitchen bags that I already have as liners and no odor!! I can't belive some of the negative reviews. Our daughter is 14 months old and we have used this since day one. To the reviewer who said wipes get stuck...WRAP THEM IN THE DIRTY DIAPER. You should do that no matter what diaper system you have. I wouldn't trade this for any other system!!!"
121936,1,"Kolcraft Contours Options Tandem Stroller - RubyI did the research and followed the advice of most. I went to the store and took this baby for a spin. WoW! This stroller is awesome. It is hard to believe it has so many options. The kids love it and hova a blast in it, they love to ride in it when we go for walks. The best part is that it fits in the trunk of my Toyota Yaris with room to spare. I highly recommend it!"
62168,0,"My husband bought this stroller with the infant car seat because he loved the colors and the fact that it folds so compactly and you can carry the strap over your shoulder. Yes, its nice and all... but the car seat could be better..it tends to get stuck in the base if you dont pull it out straight, the car seat is a little difficult to attach to the stroller, there are no lines or obvious visual guides to help you click the car seat in quickly which you might need to do if you are by yourself with the baby in the middle of the street. Who wants to be lifting the car seat up and down into the stroller over and over again because you cant figure out where it clicks. Oh! And sometimes one side clicks and not the other! Then you have to start over again. As other reviewers have stated, the basket underneath is way too small. You can barely fit anything in there and if its something heavy it will drag! Even if you want to go to the store to pick up a few things, nothing fits! Once I had to put bread and lunch meat in the stroller with my son, because I had no where to put it! Imagine if I was buying more stuff. The strap for the stroller is great, cause it frees up your hands to hold the car seat, but be forewarned, if you are 5' 2'' and trying to go up or down stairs...the wheels will drag and make you almost fall. Kinda defeats the purpose. The handle bars on the stroller dont appear to be adjustable so if you are over 5' 2'' this stroller is not for you.For first time moms out there: PLEASE LISTEN... get yourself a nice infant seat with a five point harness and a base. Get one of those unversal strollers that the car seat can just snap in. They are light, way more affordable, and have a nice size basket underneath."
155775,1,The geranium scent is my favorite. It smells so good that I ordered it from Amazon when I couldn't find it in the store. Only problem is the container leaks around the pump.
92346,1,"I bought this for our newborn baby before she was born. All products are safe for baby, and no-tears. The smell is so lovely when bath time is over. Love the carrier too - keeps everything organized!"
80566,1,My daughter loves these diapers. They are great for children who are just starting to learn how to potty train!
72083,0,"We have the mini Roxanne crib, which converts to a twin bed frame. After learning of the need for cross support (not included), I'm not sure it's worth it for us since the rails are so expensive. Also, FYI Walmart has the kit for $50."
157957,1,honest! I slept so much better knowing if something were to go wrong I would know! We even used it in her bassinet. There is a sensitivity selector on it so for the we used a lower setting- the mattress is so much thinner than a crib one. And yes we did have a few cases where it went off and she was fine- one time she rolled so far to the top of her crib it couldn't register her- which seems strange until you know that the sensor pad actually tilts in all directions-even diagonal so it can sense her every movement- but she was so small and had moved so far up it went off- which I'd rather have false alarms this way! Sure it gives you a jolt- but I still feel safer with it than without it. I I have told everyone I know about it! And there is a switch to turn off the movenment sensor if you choose to do so- so you have nothing to loose! And all the peace of mind to gain!
55359,1,"I purchased one of these back in April 2003 and my daughter has used it from the time of her birth to just a few days ago. Yes, that is over 2 years and it would have lasted probably in my opinion until even after she outgrew her carseat but she stepped in one of the pockets while climbing up into her carseat the other day and ripped the pockets' seams apart.I have had no problems with my carseats sliding (Keep in mind I used it for her infant carrier, 2 different convertible carseats, and presently a high back booster seat plus I used it in 2 vehicles one with leather and the other fabric.). I did however use one of those ""Mighty Tighty"" seatbelt winchers, which I think should be required for all carseat installations. You can not get a carseat tight enough without one. I have 3 children and only had/have the winch with my 3rd and her carseat was/is the only one that was/is truely snug.As for the pockets, they were great for holding bottles or toys when she was a baby and now great for a pack of crayons, toys, sippy cup, or a baggy of snacks for those days on the go.The fabric material is much better than the vinyl or plastic ones because if they do spill something it absorbs rather than running to the back seam of the seat and building up that goo that all parents know. Then when you have time just toss it in your washing machine and hang dry and you are good as new.I am ordering another one of these today to replace the one my daughter ripped. I would/do recommend this item to all my freinds that have children.P.S. For all you reviewers who said police have said you should not use this product you should ignore their opinions as you would/do those who give/gave you all that parenting advise for your child. I was featured on the front page of my city's newspaper when my daughter was 8 weeks old for having the safest installed carseat in a carseat check for our city performed by our local police and sheriffs dept."
89237,1,We were using regular diapers and Dylan's clothes were always wet by morning. these diapers hold a phenomenal amount of liquid. he now sleeps through the night. No more 12am changes.
38725,0,"I purchased this product because my husband & I don't like the ""traditional"" bath tubs for newborns/infants.This product served its purpose for the first two months of our daughters life. I love the fact that it lays in the water & once you put the child on it, the water surrounds them so it feels like the baby is back in the womb & pretty much calms them down/helps them stay calm. Our daughter had no problems with this & seemed to love it!The tag states that the item has to be rinsed thoroughly & air dried. By air dry, you basically need to put it outside on a patio/balcony or keep it some place where air can get to it freely. The only problem with this is, that once you rinse it, it's not like there is no more water held inside it. There is!! Water continues to drip from this for awhile before it is completely ""empty"". Therefore, you must either place a bucket or towel underneath it. I don't know how the towel would help since, in my experience, the towel would be soaked through before the bath pad was ""dry"". I had it hanging in my shower(which it says not to do), but since I have a window in my shower, I thought that this would be enough air. It was not! Shortly before the end of our two month mark with this product, I noticed it starting to smell like mildew! Time to throw away!!!I loved this product for the short time that I had it. I just wish there was an easier way to let it dry. Since I live in an apartment, my options for drying it were not many & leaving it to soak a towel was not one of them. I recommend this, but not for extended use.We opted to go & buy the Fisher-Price Hippo Happy Bathing Tub. It is the next best thing, in my opinion, to this bath pad. It's low & lets your child sit in the water without having a ""tub inside a tub"" thing going on. Here is the link for the Hippo Tub that we are currently using & love.http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Hippo-Happy-Bathing-Tub/dp/B005IWM7VU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1337600156&sr;=8-1"
104999,1,"these go on very easily and stay put! I've had mine on for 2 years now when the first baby came along and just left them on for future babies. Very soft and cushioned. Nice natural color so it doesn't stand out, just blends in with the slate and stone work on the hearth!"
124866,0,"The bag is very beautiful and I've received a lot of compliments on it. I love the backpack strap option, but other than that I've been a little disappointed with the bag.- when using the backpack straps you can not close the zipper on the back pocket since the straps are secured inside the pocket.- the bag is quite stiff and boxy, so whether it is full or empty it is always bulky- given the dimensions of the bag it doesn't actually carry that much stuff inside it.- The inside of the bag is deep and narrow, with just one zipper at the top for opening. I've found it to be awkward to find my way around the inside of the bag, unless it isn't very full.- I've gotten a few water stains on it and I'm not sure how to get them out - anyone have advice on that?I've actually stopped using this bag, sadly. I love that it is a beautiful fabric and has the strap options, but other than that I've found it to be incredibly inconvenient and awkward, poorly designed and not worth the money I spent."
139881,1,"Our 8-month old twin boys absolutely love this walker! They've used it constantly since we bought one for them to try out. They love being able to get around themselves without needing adult assistance. They chase the dogs and us around the kitchen, family room, anywhere they can get the walker to go! Unfortunately, our twins' pediatric occupational therapist says we should limit their use of this type of walker. Apparently the way the seat positions them, it promotes toe-walking and makes it more difficult for babies to learn to walk properly. This was confirmed by a friend who's 1-yr old nephew used this since he was 6-months old and now walks on his toes all the time. We'll continue using it since the boys enjoy it so much, but we will be limiting the amount of time they stay in it."
118312,2,This is a love/hate relationshipLoveThat they work so well with bottle accessories and cups stuff later on.They tack nice and don't take up too much room.Fit right onto the Avent pump.Store nice and works well for freezing.Great stackability.Easy to write on in pencil and erase (to know which batch comes first).HateThey were hard to screw on (the flat tops to the bottoms and many times were on crooked).Leaked too much milk (and as any BFing mother knows... losing milk is well like losing money).
91283,2,"Perhaps it's because we live in a high traffic area, but we have nothing but static using this monitor. If you walk by the receiver using the cordless or cellphone it completely loses all reception and all you hear is static. The receiver also seems to have trouble around our direct tv boxes.With all the electronic gidgets and gadgets out there spend the money and get the higher end models that really do block out interference.The real kicker of this was I was asleep one night while my husband was out working and I heard a males voice in the monitor. I immediately freaked out thinking someone broke into the house and was in the baby's room. I jumped out of bed and was ready to run into the baby's room when I heard the guy talking to a girl in what appeared to be a cell phone conversation from who knows where. Talk about almost having a heart attack on the spot!FP should just stop making this model period."
5150,1,"I bought these b/c my youngest daughter kept getting a rash after using another brand of diapers which I loved on our first daughter. I was hesitant to change brands b/c I loved the way the other diapers fit and did not leak, but decided to change for her sake and her rash soon cleared up and the diapers do a great job! I was very impressed with how well they work, even with breastfeeding poop!!"
142076,2,"I got it the other day and shipping it back now (it costs an arm and a leg to ship it back, btw). It's basically cheaply made mattress, covered with thick white plastic, very stiff and rigid, not soft in any way, and there is no memory foam feel to it whatsoever. I can't even tell if there is memory foam inside, it feels like a bunch of springs covered with something. Don't waste your money, it's not worth it."
50759,0,"I have a love hate relationship with this pillow. On one hand, it really works. I started using it at about 6 months pregnant because I was having a lot of trouble sleeping due to the changes in my body. And the first night I used it, I slept beautifully. Since then, my body has continued to change and the pillow has continued to really help my sleeping. It is very well designed.On the other hand, the pillow is way overpriced considering the quality. The pillow itself is filled with cheap poly filling and has a cheap cover. In fact, the fabric seems identical to the cheap pillows you get on a plane. The cover that comes with the pillow is also cheap polyester and doesn't have a zipper. So it takes a lot of wrangling and maneuvering to get the pillowcase on the pillow. For $50, this pillow is a total ripoff... but it works."
136450,2,"First off putting this together was a nightmare. None of the pieces were labeled and all of the hardware was in one big bag so I had to do everything from the pictures. Second, a bunch of the holes didn't line up and one of the drawers isn't flush on the inside. The same drawer wobbles when you pull it out and the top one catches and you have to yank it to get it out. The cabinet on the side the shelves wobble and there is no catch for the door the shelves actually stop the door. I didn't order this from Amazon and I got the dresser/hutch combo for 300 some odd dollars and I wish I had not gone with this brand. It is all particle board with a wood veneer. That being said it works like crap but at least it looks good sitting there."
96603,1,"I bought this pump a few days ago, though I think it may be a newer model than depicted above. I recently suffered my third miscarriage and noticed that after my D&C, I started lactating, though just a very tiny bit. Though I have no baby to feed, I don't believe that my milk should go to waste. I decided I wanted to donate my baby juice to a milk bank so it could be given to critically ill and prematurely born babies for nutrition. I knew that I surely did not have enough milk to donate just enough to hand-express a few drops every few minutes. I knew I would need a pump to increase my supply to be able to donate one day. Since I've had this pump my milk supply has increased and now I get a tiny flow rather than just a few little drops. The suction is fantastic!!! The best part is that it has a knob that adjusts the suction...it's great! The pump is quiet and easy to handle. I would recommend it to anyone! This pump is doing more than just letting me donate to sick babies but also enabling me to keep what I have left of mine. To Evenflo, Thank you!"
114553,0,"We have a very sociable 7 month old daughter who always needs to sit at the dinner table. Since we spend a lot of time at her grand parents, so we wanted to get a high chair which does not take up a lot of space, easy to clean, allow her to sit the table with us, stable, will grow with her and relatively cheap.After a short research we decided on the rainforest booster seat, not only does this seat meet all our requirements and our daughter LOVES it! So much easier to feed her when she is elevated. At times when we have enough table room, we let her sit with us on the booster without the tray, and we would always give her a snack so she feels like she is part of the dinner party. At other times she is content sitting next to us with the tray in and play the rainforest toys that is part of the system that snaps into the tray.However! We have bruised her twice in the 3 weeks since we got the seat, her finger is totally purple as I am typing this!!! Parents beware when snapping the tray into place, if you are not holding your little one's hands while you doing this, she might just move her arms or fingers between the seat and the tray, and as it does take some force to snap the tray in, sometimes it is too late to notice her finger is caught till it is too late.Luckily despite the 2 incidences our daughter still likes to sit in the seat during meal time, and somehow I have a feeling an accident like this might happen again as it is not hard to do, so we have decided to sit her right up against the table most of the time and not to use the tray unless we have to."
107196,2,"The diaper champ begs to be knocked out. It is wishful to think that this contraption controls the stink. If anything, it allows the diapers to ferment into a far worse state than if a person on a daily basis simply tied off the bag and took the soiled diapers out of the house. Diapers don't really smell bad unless they are given time to ripen, for which the champ is perfect. The diapers actually smell far worse and stronger in the champ after a day than in a open paper grocery bag coupled with a plastic bag. (i know my kid's waste stinks so believe me i know the paper bag works better and is easier for throwing out other baby-changing materials, dare to compare)The chute and sliding weight, while creative, is not that effective. The weight like some others have mentioned needs help towards the end of a bag and sometimes when the bag is not that full. My real problem lies with the chute. If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time. Also, that means putting dirty wipes down the chute is a no-no b/c they will just soil the mechanism. One person made a good suggestion of lining the chute hole with a plastic bag but i would prefer not to have bag the garbage b/f i put it in another garbage bag not to mention having to pull out a new bag for every diaper.Lastly, changing the bag is a pain. I'm a dexterous person but i've spent a number of times clawing this thing open. Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off. In my opinion the smell is minimal that way and nonexistent compared to a full diaper champ.Where or when is this thing the champ? At the baby shower this item lives up to its name. Everybody ooohs and aaaahs, the presenter will be slapped on the back and carried around the room on everybody's shoulders. It ""looks"" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup. I gave this to dear friends and i was really proud of myself (even though my wife picked it out). Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two. The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase. Good luck, i'm going to go rub mine for luck."
100213,1,"The product: I haven't experimented with so many other brands b/c friends told me that Pampers caused less rash/less leaks. Of pampers, I like baby dry b/c it holds it all in decently. after she sleeps from 7pm to 7am her diaper is literally a bag of urine - but it holds and unlike some of the other diapers it doesn't seep through the outside layer. For poop I just like to make sure the diaper goes high enough in the back and generally I have her wear a size up (that solved her poop leak problems).Now, if you already know you like this product, this is the best deal I have found. I get 15-20% off w/free shipping coupons in parenting magazine and that added to the decently low price with free 2 day shipping to my door - please tell me if there is a better deal out there than this!"
43807,0,"PROS:-Compact (less bulky than the floppy seat)-Inconspicuous to carry-You don't have to deflate it every time if you don't want to. It can folded and carried still inflated.-Very easy to wipe clean.CONS:-Awkward to set up in a restaurant, particularly having to reach underneath the chair to buckle the lower strap and to deflate with your knees.-UNSAFE: Depending on the chair back, the back strap may loosen when the child leans forward or to the side.-14 month old would lean to one side.Most First Years products are excellent, but this one needs some adjustment. As is, it is unsafe. I had to sit very close to my son to make sure he did not fall out. We had to tie the back strap to in a knot to keep it from coming loose, then struggle with untying the knot when it was time to leave the restaurant. This MIGHT be ok if you are using it in one place for a week vacation or something but not for daily use in restaurants. Unfortunately, had to return."
134924,1,This is a Great way to still use your AVent baby bottles. You just replace the nipple with this sport cup spout from Avent and your child now has an instant baby sippy cup! My daughter switched without a complaint. And it doesn't spill milk all over the place.
6244,1,"We originally purchased the Summer Infant video monitor but even after waiting for the company to replace a faulty video monitor (sound worked, video did not), the picture quality was terrible. Even putting the monitor outside the baby's room with the door open, we had zero reception. We picked up the Safety 1st system, having been happy with some of their other products, and have been very pleased with the product. The picture quality is very good, even at night, and the audio picks up everything in the room and in the vicinity of the room. This product was well worth the money spent. We also loved that it came with an extra audio receiver that we were able to keep in a different room."
24078,1,"I love reading Amazon reviews when I go to purchase something, and for this product, the reviews really helped me out. Like others, this is just what I needed. I had been using the 24 mm that come with the pump (I have the freestyle) and suddenly, I started experiencing pain and even bleeding. Upon further investigation, I realized too much of my skin was being sucked into the shield causing a lot of irritation and pain). I ordered these and I feel SO much better. No more pain, and my milk is back to the production levels it had been. If you are experiencing pain while pumping, I suggest going to the Medela website and looking at their diagrams for good/bad fits for pumping. This smaller size has been a lifesaver for me!"
92893,1,"We recently had our twin 3 year old nieces come to visit us. We used these cots as their beds while they visited and they loved them. They even said at one point that it was their favorite part of the trip! They fold up small, are sturdy, have a washable cover, and are a great value! I would definitely recommend them to anyone."
142596,1,"The My Brest Friend has a wonderful new design for nursing moms. Our first daughter had the old version with a velcro closure...it made a loud noise when taking the pillow off. This new design is perfect with our second. The closure is just a snap, no worries of waking your newborn or readjusting the closure. I love the tight fit and extra support for the back which the Boppy and others do not give you. It washes great...and I agree with others just lay a blanket across and swaddle your baby back when your done...the blanket lessens the wash and wear. Best of luck Breastfeeding."
161631,2,"I registered for this bath tub and received it as a shower gift. The first (and only) time I used it, it leaked all over my kitchen counter. We returned it. I wish I had read all the reviews on this website first--I would have not selected this product on my registry."
173439,0,"We received this swing as a gift and since Abby is our first child we didn't realize how a swing makes life a lot easier. Abby loves the swing but at 6 months the motor finally died. The mobile and music still play but the swinging mechanism is dead. I looked at the weight requirements and the top weight is 24 lbs. This week Abby was weighed at 17 lbs and we needed to have the swing on the highest setting for it to move. We also needed to replace the batteries every week and a half. Fisher Price needs to re-evaluate the weight requirements and/or get a stronger motor. When Abby was first born (6 lbs, 9 oz) we would have it on the lowest setting and she would practically fly out. I'm sad that it died because she is not a good napper and the swing was the one thing that could make her nap for longer stretches. I don't know if I will contact F.P because I have learned in the past that their customer service is not the strongest which is unfortunate because children seem to like the products."
31938,1,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these. I started out using snappies, but these are much better! I write dates on with a sharpie and then wipe it off and re use. Great product."
28654,1,"We bought this glider and ottoman set in May 2011 as we were expecting a new born. Since the birth of our baby boy, we have been using the glider and ottoman all the time and it's been a good help. It feel some what comfortable and does it's job."
86691,0,"The Basket is fine, but the small matress liner inside is too small which makes the basket unusable. We order the baskets to be used at a later time, so we can't return them now."
135505,1,"This item was purchased to place in my mother's bedroom at nighttime. Since she has Alzheimer's, I needed a way to monitor her should she fall. The monitor works great. Recommend it to any and all whether they have a baby or senior citizen in their home."
46426,1,"This breast pump was actually pretty comfortable to use. I'd tried the Medela single manual breast pump and that really didn't work out for me. Then I tried the Ameda Purely Yours but it was very awkward. You have to actually hold those in place with your hands. The Playtex is designed a bit better. The backs of the actual pumps is flat, so you can use one arm across the back of both to hold them in place. It frees up one hand to read a book or use the remote or something along those lines. I did like the suction of the Ameda a little more, but honestly, I'd rather have the comfort and spend a minute or two more sitting there."
59278,0,This is a good diaper bag. It is a nice big size and extremely easy to wipe off if you get something on it.
82003,2,"They leaked. Of the 20 or so bags I've defrosted, 3 have leaked. Terrible! I have had to work so hard to pump extra for my son, and losing those three bags meant he had to have formula while I was at work this week. I will NEVER buy them again!"
50270,1,"I bought the gender neutral bears when I was pregnant and LOVE them!! So, I didn't hesitate to buy these pink bunnies for my sister in law when she was expecting her baby girl! They are sooo cute for starters! WAY better than anything you'll find in the store. AND they are functional :) What more can you ask for? They prevent the straps of car seats/strollers (I bought 2 pair - Car Seat & Stroller) from digging in to your baby's shoulders and neck but they ALSO work as a sort of head support or neck pillow, which I wasn't really expecting. A bonus feature in my book!! My son is 19 months old, we still use them and he still loves them! Going to have to buy more for this next baby due in April!"
83433,1,I would recommend this product as a must have. I have a baby trend jogger and use it all the time. It is easy to use and it definitely keeps the wind and rain from contacting my child. I finally found a product that will keep me on track with my exercise regimen. I don't have to be hindered by the weather anymore.
25674,1,"The Cradler is a simple product that can make a huge difference! Soft and easy to use, it installs by Velcro to the straps of the car seat. Since my son's head is supported while he is sleeping, he tends to sleep longer on flights as well as in the car. I wait until he is sleeping to put the Cradler on. This item is highly recommended to my ""Jet With Kids"" readers!"
141623,0,having to put it together is a little lame but I understand why they do that. i didn't count the pieces but it seems to be 6 or 7.
32683,1,"This carrier may cost a little more than others, but it is worth every penny. I tried all of the other brands out in the store with my 3 month old. She protested all of them but LOVED BabyBjorn. I found this one to be the most comfortable too. I use this carrier every day with her. If you have a baby that likes to be held all the time, this product is a must. I can't say enough good things about it!"
141085,1,This is really great! I bought it for my 10 month old granddaughter and the other (older) children love it to. Nice that it has a volume control and its not real loud.
65402,1,"I have tried everything for my son's dry skin and eczema including Eurcerin, Cetaphil, ""Pot of Gold"", Aquaphor, Aveeno etc. This is the only product that has worked. There was a noticeable difference 24 hours after using it. Would recommend this product to anyone with a child suffering from eczema. It may be a little pricey, but it's worth it!"
57084,1,"The gate was easy to assemble and install. It works very easily and at least as well as hoped. We bought two gates. One was lacking the installation hardware. However, the company responded very quickly to ship it to us with minimal delay. I am very pleased with this product and would purchase this same gate if another were needed. Two thumbs up!"
137758,1,"This product does exactly what it says it does, but I found that the stars do not really show up very well on the ceiling without being placed on a higher surface, which then makes a smaller area in which the stars show up! When just placed on the dresser, the stars cover most of the ceiling in a small room, but are very dim, esp. the yellow/gold stars! The blue stars show up the best, but still so dim when placed on a normal surface! The batteries died very fast in this product also, thankfully we use rechargeable batteries! No movement of the stars or sounds from the turtle! It is also not a toy I would let my child play with, so it only has on function!"
20302,0,"All of the bottles out there have slightly different features. What distinguishes these is that they are supposed to prevent gas and colic. We used many types of bottles with our first baby and he did have some colic problems, so we decided only to use Playtex VentAire with our second baby. While these may be doing something, the results are not miraculous as gas/colic is an issue we still experience.We never experienced leaking with these bottles and do not think there are any disadvantages that these bottles have to others out there. The shape of the bottle is a little different too, but that really didn't make it any easier or more difficult in any way for us, so that was more of a style difference than anything else. We have tried both the wide bottles and the smaller kind, and they both work the same."
6647,1,"Cruisers work. They are stretchy enough to prevent leaks on your crawling baby. The padding is absorbent, and does a good job of wicking moisture away from your baby's skin. They also come up high enough on the backside to prevent most overflow conditions.They are definetly a good value for the money. I would also agree that they run a little large compared to other brands/styles, so I would try the smaller size if you are unsure of whether to go with a 4 or 5."
109307,0,"We used these when our son was 6-8 months and it helped the transfer of textures, etc. He definitely loved eating from these. The only problem I had with it was the cleaning. It is definitely NOT easy cleaning these feeders. Just when we thought we had them cleaned we would find food particles stuck in various parts of the feeder. But it was good for the transfer for a short period of time."
73956,1,"I purchased this stroller because I have a son who is 3 and now a newborn. Amazon shipped this item to me in 1 day despite having to be shipped over the border!I was thoroughly pleased to find that the Caboose was very easy to assemble, all of the parts just snapped on.I was a bit concerned that my Safety 1st carseat would not work with this stroller as with other brands I had read online that there was a limited selection of brands that were compatible. I'm using the universal child seat adapter with no problems. I believe it's more generic design would allow any infant car seat to fit securely.I had also read, and seen a video on YouTube, that it was difficult to fit a child sitting on the bench with a car seat in the front. Thankfully this has not been my experience. My 3 year old son (who is very large for his age) can easily sit on the bench and has plenty of room to keep his feet on the foot stool area. He enjoys being able to turn around and have access to this brother from this position as well.I would definitely recommend this stroller to anyone who has two kids; one who needs to be pushed full time and one who isn't quite able to walk long distances yet."
130571,1,"Glad i don't need to find out. this swing has been a life saver. i think it is my most used baby item.my 13wk old son can sit and watch his fish go by and be quite entertained.If he is tired and cranky because he cannot fall asleep, all i have to do is put him in the swing, turn on his fishies and the kid is out in a matter of minutes. He will sleep very comfortably in it as well.it is comfy, and cozy, has secure straps for when a little older and seems as sturdy as these things come.I will be very sad when he outgrows it, which I hope still won't be for a while.When he was first born he did not like the swinging. Like others have said, even the lowest speed, is (i think) quite fast. Put a blanket behind the seat around the pole and it will slow down significantly, so it's nnot that big a deal.At around 4-5 wks, my son started to LOVE the swinnging. it is strange because if he is not sound asleep and he drifts off, the minute you turn it off, he's back up.Like the musical settings too, but sometimes they shut off too quickly and i'm hitting the reset button more often than i would like.But overall a GREAT BUY.i have two pregnant friends right now, and it is what i will get them as shower gifts."
89592,1,"Pampers are the best diapers on the market, esp. for active toddlers. I also usually like the deals I can get on them at Amazon. So I was kind of irritated and upset to receive a box with expired diapers. Granted, nothing much can spoil in a diaper but it is still upsetting to receive a product whose expiration date had already been reached over a year ago. So please, inventory needs to be more carefully checked or it needs to be mentioned at the site that the diapers are expired. Some people may not mind buying expired diapers, but some do."
60277,1,"We highly recommend this tub to all of our friends about to have babies (and there seem to be a lot of them these days).We have been bathing our son in this tub since we started giving him baths. He is now 9 months and just loves the tub! (Most other baby bathtubs may last until the baby is 2-3 months and then they outgrow them). It is definitely worth the extra $5-10 dollars to have a tub that will last and last.I have read some reviews that complain about the drain draining too slowly...we have never used the drain. We simply turn the tub over to empty it out. In fact this is a big part of the bedtime routine...after our son is dry and in his PJs he watches Daddy turn over the tub and the water splash about. He thinks this is great fun!I have also read some that complain about the size of the tub (which is its major benefit, I think). We leave it upside down to dry out over night in our tub and then take it out in the morning for our showers). Granted the Euro tub does take up some room in the bathroom, but we just lean it against the wall and move around it.The only challenge we have had was when our son was tiny...I wish I had read some of the reviews about putting a washcloth under him to keep him from slipping...while it wasn't a problem, it made us a bit nervous when we were first learning to bathe him.All in all, I LOVE this tub and would definitely buy it again (already have for some shower presents). Totally worth the $$. We consider one of the best things we have bought for the baby."
40302,1,"Best of the throw-aways. Very absorbant, the securing tabs work almost as good as the overnight pampers. In 18 months had 2 malfunctions. I highly recommend these diapers."
110648,2,"Very heavy constuction,and heavy to carry. Definitely not intended for a pack and play or travel bed. It took very long to assemble the sleeper: the ""snap in locks"" dont work well at. The ""natural color"" turns out to look like faded yellow plastic, with warning signs on every side of the sleeper. I dont need to be reminded every time I put my baby down for a nap, on how he could get killed, if I havent assembled the thing EXACTLY as it was stated in the manual. Dont buy it if you are looking for a nice furniture. There are other brands out there, that do a better job with an adjustable co-sleeper bed."
180096,0,"The pump is great, it is quick, the action on the handle is smooth and not tiring. And I have carpal tunnel issues so this is a huge compliment! I like to use this when traveling and at home when I can't commit to sitting in front of my electric pump with all the tubing set up. This is great for quickly pumping when the baby is in limbo, ie you need to be ready to put down the pump and jump into action. I also have managed to nurse on one side and pump on the other. I also bring it along if I'm getting engorged and can't nurse or the baby is not hungry. The only caveat is that the bottle doesn't seal tight so if you turn the pump on its side or its in a diaper bag with milk in it, it will leak a lot of milk. So bring a cap along and cap off your bottle to prevent leaking.Actually I am revisiting this review because it leaks a lot more than when I first got it. It's kind of annoying."
142413,0,"It was really tough to put together. I liked the fact that it is double sided. The sides don't come down and stow away as easily as the product would have you believe, so we just keep them up all the time. Once they are up they are pretty sturdy. My daughter has certainly put them to the test and they do their job of keeping her from falling out. Overall they do the job, but I was disappointed in the design."
65486,2,"I loved this item at face value - it looks good, the materials are good quality, it feels secure, and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what I wanted because I planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by. I was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came. Well, the ""mattress"" that comes with it is so hard that my baby won't sleep in it. She won't nap in it, and when I put her down all she does is cry. I've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would, but she won't sleep in it at all. I've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that I tuck in the sides (something I don't want to do because of the SIDS factor) and that doesn't even help - it's still too hard of a surface. Now, my baby is sleeping in bed with me and I can't get any sleep because I'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed. If they'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby, this would be a perfect product and I'd rate it a 5, but because it's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board, I have to rate it only 2 stars. I'm so let down by this product."
92192,2,"Penaten Baby Cream is an awsome product! I had used it in Germany 30 years ago on my infant son and was sorry I did not bring a ""truck load"" of it home with me. I tried to get a pharmacist to stock it here in the States but at the time they thought I had an unusual request and were at a loss as to how to make it happen. I was excited to see I could buy it on the internet for my grandchildren. Because I knew how wonderful Penaten Cream was I decided to try other products. Could they be as awsome? One choice was Penaten Puder. It was expensive but no better than regular baby powder we get here in the States. Why pay more? It says it is made in Germany but also has that familiar ""Johnson&Johnson"" logo on the container as well. Unless someone knows something about this product that I don't I would not recommend it over our local products."
59011,0,"I couldn't breasfeed my daughter so she have been a formula fed since she was born... So, for me this was a most have because I have to warm up my daughter's formula all the time. The problem with this warmer is that you can't let it finish, because if you do it the formula will be normally TOO HOT!!...The solution: If you buy concentrate formula, just warm here the concentrate formula and after it's hot you could add the water...In this way is going to have the perfect temperature for your baby to eat...But if you use powder or ready to use you have to count the minutes and take out the bottle before it's done."
53221,2,I got this for my baby shower and was excited to try it out. It is way to BIG as well as expensive. I used my swing and bouncer much more than this. Save your money and buy a swing and bouncer. It will be money well spent.
57662,0,My baby likes this and plays with it like a toy. I didn't like the fact that it was made of 100% of polyester.
126371,1,"Couldn't believe this deal - about $1.50 a case less than the best price I can get in stores, with NO shipping!"
86046,2,My handheld video monitor worked for a year or so then started to flash rapidly to the point that you can barely see anything on the monitor anymore. For the amount of money this costs it should last more than a year. I was hoping to use it for a second child. I would not recommend or buy again until they either drop the price or make it more durable.
130458,0,"THis swing was great when my son was a few weeks old. He was picky and sometimes did not want to swing front to back so this was great because of being able to swing side to side. Many times this helped him settle down and go to sleep when nothing else would.The swing goes too fast though. We always used the lowest setting and had to tuck a blanket under him to hit the floor to slow it down.And it says its good till they are 25 pounds. NOT TRUE! My son is currently 19 pounds and this swing stopped swinging with him in it a few weeks ago. WHen I take him out and turn it on, its fine but will not swing anymore. Thats a bummer because he loves it still but I cant put him in it unless its just to sit in."
89546,0,"I subscribed this item. The first few package included the original Pampers recharges box. At this time the recharges box was NONFUNCTIONAL, and very different looking from the originals (not even showed the Pampers logo). If it wouldn't be from Amazon, I would say it is counterfeit... If the next time I get the same nonfunctional recharges box then I will unsubscribe this item."
84933,1,"Quality was first rate. Bought this seat for my Grandson. The folding arm rests and cup holders suit him to a ""T"" and the seat is really comfortable for long hauls. I would highly recommend this booster to anyone."
73176,1,"My husband and I sail a lot and used this as a bed for our daughter on our boat. It worked great for that.Also, our daughter had a slight problem with flathead syndrome and I decided to switch her over to a tummy sleeper around 4 months of age. I used this travel bed for her naps so I could keep her with me at all times to watch her.This was a great bed and worked up until she was about 6 months old. I brought it to friends' and relatives' homes when we had our daughter with us. Nap time was never a problem because she always had a comfortable, safe place to sleep.This is a nice ADDITION to a Pack 'n Play. It folds up nice and tiny and has a shoulder strap for easy carrying. Perfect for on-the-fly trips where you MIGHT need a bed.This item suited our needs very well and will be used with our next baby, too.I gave it four instead of five stars because the sides are a bit flimsy. But, we never had a problem with that. It just seems like Eddie Bauer could have made them a bit more stable. That's my only ""complaint"", if you can even call it that."
76623,1,It is a thin felted wool that you can actually wash in the machine.We mainly used this cover as the night cover and never had a leak once. I recommend this cover for anyone.
87009,1,"Do yourself a favor and get these Playtex bottles to begin with. I started with Avent bottles (because Avent also offers sterilizers, bottle warmers, etc....) But Avent bottles were AWFUL. They leaked and it was impossible to screw the lids on correctly. So I got Dr. Brown bottles. They were pretty good and they didn't leak... but it was a big hassle to wash (it takes forever to wash so many little parts with the tiny brush they give you). So I switched to Playtex after finding out that it offered BPA-free disposable liners. I am so happy I switched. It doesn't leak! And my life is so much easier since all I have to do is wash the nipples.... and the baby likes it."
36512,1,"I got this for my 2 1/2 year old son when I lost him in a store for 20 minutes. He loves backpacks, so it wasn't hard to get it on him the first time. When he is in a good mood he loves to have someone hold his ""tail"". When he is in a bad mood he knows his choice is to be in the cart or wear monkey. Having a choice is important for a 2 year old. I have used it for about 4 months and even when he pulls on it hard (trying to get away) nothing has torn. I would buy another if this one ever broke. The comments I get from strangers is ""that is such a good idea"". The ""tail"" is easy to clip on and off when it isn't needed."
154844,1,"This is an awesome product. I put my waterproof mattress pad on first, then a regular fitted sheet, then another pad + fitted sheet, then a sheet saver, and then this on top. Sounds like a lot of work, but it really saves a TON of time when there are spit ups or diaper leaks. With this one on top, you have the water proofing+a soft sheet built into 1 item that easily snaps onto crib rails. Once dirty, I unsnap it to wash. If for some reason the next layer gets dirty, I either have to take off the sheet saver or the sheet, but I still have another layer underneath...Understand now? I did this with my first born in her crib all the way up to her toddler bed while she was potty training, and I am doing it now with my infant. Has saved me a lot of time and frustration at night, especially.DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT-you will not be disappointed!"
28638,1,"Chair was put together by the wife (at her request)and it felt so much more comfortable that I thought it could be, she is pregnant and wanted something to support her back, we both love rocking our little on to sleep. really great chair at a great price. We almost bought a similar chair that was not as comfortable at Babies R Us, but I didn't want to pay 400 for a slider thank you Amazon app for iPhone!"
137305,0,I bought this to help me sleep while pregnant. In all honesty it was comfortable and helped but I could have the same support needed with pillows. The design is almost to big for sharing a bed with anyone else. It was also hard to move around.
131524,1,"We LOVE this Primo Potty Seat, I have been recommending it to everyone I know who has a child getting ready to potty train. Quick, easy and compact,Very easy to keep clean and STURDY!!! (We tried others before this and they were very flimsy) For the price this cannot be beat! I can even carry this in my purse! We take it everywhere we go, the mall, playdates and of course long car rides and vacation. Never have to worry if there is a small kids size pottey or about your child falling in or having a fear of falling in. Great product and I highly recommend it!"
171068,1,My daughter carries this around all day long saying all the names of the people in it! It holds so many photos and it's basically indestructible. It goes everywhere with us. I highly recommend this.
103499,0,"As a tub side seat the sit 'n store is comfortable enough to sit on, but it's impossible to sit facing forward with my knees against the side of our garden tub and still be able to reach down to bathe my daughter. Sitting sideways is a little easier, but then I'm have to twist around which is rather uncomfortable. I even tried kneeling on it, but that puts a strain on my back. I usually end up standing and pushing the tub side seat away. If I could just find a comfortable way to use it during bathtime I would give it 5 stars because it functions so well in every other way.As a storage container it is spacious enough to hold all the pieces to my daughter's bath toys and it even has vents on the sides so air can circulate through.My 2-year-old loves using it as a step stool. It's light enough for her to move it on her own, but big enough to offer her plenty of room and it stays in place without sliding around while in use.I like the color of the blue lid, unfortunately it clashes with the color scheme of the bathroom, so I used Krylon spray paint for plastics to paint it a more neutral color. I usually store it in the cabinet under the sink, but if I happen to leave it out it blends in with the decor and it doesn't take up too much space.All in all I would recommend it. It's convienent for sitting while I dress my daughter and serves as a portable bath kit. Since she often attempts to run when she knows it's bathtime, having eveything in one place makes getting started much easier.Another use for it is as a toilet training step stool. Small children can rest their feet on it, and if you have a removable child toilet seat, depending on the size, you can store it inside here along with a box of flushable wipes and child hand soap."
96311,1,As close to leak proof as I have found. Both my boys chewed on the straw a little while teething and therefore made the straw where it would leak some if tipped over. Replacements eventually had to be bought.
176889,2,This product is okay at times but it takes time warming a bottle that my child is always crying for about 5 mintues waiting for her bottle to warm up so i just end up warming it on the stove which takes about 2 seconds also it's cooler isn't that great i put the cooler at night and in the morning it is water again and i have to put my bottles back in the refrigerator so they wouldn't rot.This product is a waste of time and a waste of money!
113479,1,"This seat is the best seat for easy clean-up. We switched after using this seat on vacation when my son was about 6 months old (he is currently 17 mo. and ~26 lbs.). He seemed to eat better and pay more attention to meals while sitting in this seat, possibly because it fit him better. In our regular high chair, a Peg Perego one, he would ""get lost."" It was just too big for him. Also, it's great for easy clean-up. We had just switched to this seat when my son had a poop-tacular accident in the chair. We just put him right in the tub while my husband sprayed the chair off in the back yard with the hose. I'm so glad he wasn't in the fancy high chair!"
148442,1,"I got this potty for my 10 months daughter who had constipation problems.... it all went away once she started to sat on the potty! It helped her so much. She uses it everyday and she loves it! The size is perfect for a small kid, easy to carry and to clean. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!"
58242,1,"I am the mother of a 2&amp;1/2 month old and have been using this product for 2 months now. It is a must have for winter babies!! We put a light-weight jacket, if needed, over her outfit, put her in her car-seat and just zip her up. It is so convenient. I just can't imagine having to bundle your baby up in a heavy coat/snowsuit and then try to fit them securely into their car-seat. What a nightmare!!"
156555,1,"I give it 4 stars only because it is better as a chair than as a swing for our baby. Our baby sits in it and stares up at the flower and likes to listen to the music, but once the swing starts moving...he hates it. He looks pretty uncomfortable as it swings, but stationary, it's good to keep in to enjoy the music and toys. So basically, we use it more as a bouncy chair than a swing. But I think I'm going to go ahead and return it and get the Linkadoos bouncer instead."
94376,1,"I have had the same 8 bottles throughout my daugter (now 7) and son (now 2 1/2) and have never had any problem with them leaking. I have washed them mostly by hand, but have put them in the dishwasher several times and still they perform wonderfully! I have switched the nipples as the kids grew, but they held up great and really worked well for our kids. Planning to use them for baby #3, due in 10 days!"
175421,1,This is one of the softest blankets I have ever felt. The quality is awesome and I love the different designs offered. I have fallen in love with Baby Star products!!!!
128322,2,My son also broke the seat and fell in. He is 2 and a half. It also didn't seem to sit very securely on any toilet we put it on. He needed to have me sit him on it. It wouldn't have been good for pooping. I wouldn't recommend this product. We switched to using a cushie tushie potty ring. We just carry a bag large enough to hold it. He is much more comfortable and secure. I think he also likes the fact that it is the same one he uses at home.
141160,1,"My 8 month old loves this toy. Everything works great, as always amazon shipped it perfectly in a reasonable amount of time.The only drawback I have with the toy is there aren't locks on the wheels. That would be a great feature. I have to rest the toy next to his toy box or a couch so when he stands up to it, the toy doesn't roll away on him. The toy does fall back if he tries to climb. You defiantely need supervise.With all that said, the toy is alot of fun. Plays many different songs, different activities to keep him occupied, and holds moms interest as well!I would recommend it, just be aware of, yes it is a rolling toy, but if your child isn't walking great yet, you need to acomadate."
81797,1,"I was given a hand-me-down changing pad that I used for my 1st & 2nd child but it was really looking bad when baby #3 came, so I broke down and bought this. I love it! My covers fit on snug but easily and the strap has been so nice to hold baby on for a few seconds while I grab something instead of making one of my other children stand beside the baby to keep her from rolling! My child also loves to play with the strap and it keeps her occupied during changes!"
12331,2,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO BE USED AS A BABY MONITOR. I HAVE TRIED TWO OUT AND THEY ARE BOTH WORTHLESS. YOU CAN NOT HEAR YOUR BABY THROUGH IT, WHICH DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.I GAVE IT ONE STAR FOR THE COLORFUL LIGHT SHOW THAT IS CUTE. BUT AS A MONITOR FORGET IT. FISHER PRICE WILL NEED TO REMAKE THIS IN ORDER FOR CUSTOMERS TO WANT IT. THE LIGHTS AND SOUNDS MONITOR IS LESS EXPENSIVE AND OF MUCH BETTER QUALITY."
8753,1,"My son (2.5) sits LONGER at the table, is comfortable, and even likes to sit in the seat on the floor and read books! Amazingly simple to clean and very safe. It comes with a carrying case wtih handles and we take it to dinner / grandparents! He sits in this seat at restaurants and seems to behave and sit comfortably for much longer!"
174698,0,"It's a cute rug, however my 2 1/2 year old has very little interest in it."
69202,2,"Even on sale at Amazon, this is not one of the better prices I've found on these diapers. Even at regular price, they are $9-$10 at Wal-Mart and with a coupon, you can purchase them for $7-$9 depending on the coupon. The diapers are great, the prices are not."
25747,2,-nipple is WAY too big for my 7 month olds mouth-very difficult to line up lid with the cup
46701,0,"My main issue with this swing is that I think that the mechanism that makes it swing is rather loud considering babies sleep in it! I get around it by turning it on while my son sleeps in my arms and then laying him down in it. If I turn it on after putting him down sometimes the noise will cause him to stir or worse, wake up! I also turn the music on low to mask the sound some. It offers a classical mix or nature sounds.That being said, I probably would purchase this swing again because I like how deep the seat is. It's like a secure little bowl...I never strap him in and have no worries about him falling out. I took out the little headrest thing-a-ma-jig...it was always sliding down and in the way, and I didn't bother putting the tray on...too hard to get a sleeping baby in and out with the tray. Obviously, I use this primarily for naptime. I may put the tray on and start using the straps soon...he's close to sitting up (any day now!)...but then again, I may not. All in all, I like it."
137471,1,"The product was brand new as stated and it shipped to me in reasonable time. Great night light, my daughter loves it."
67128,2,"Having three children under the age of 5, I finally decided to get a triple stroller. I have probably had 10 different strollers over the past five years, ranging from $20 umbrella strollers to $500 Peg Perego strollers.I couldn't convince myself to pay $1,000 for a peg triple, so I did some research and found this stroller. I ordered it to take on our 4th of July trip to Universal Studios. Before hitting the parks, we fortunately stopped at my sister's house and then walked to a local park. This is where I learned how horrible this stroller is!My children are 24, 27 and 30 lbs. All very much under the recommended weight limits for the seats. However, the wheels flattened when the children sat in the stroller. This stroller will not turn. At corners, you have to lift up the entire back end of the stroller (which requires the child in the back to get out) and turn while only on the front wheels.The ""seat"" in the back is ridiculous. The child has to lean forward because the back of the 2nd row seat is literally on top of the 3rd seat. I moved the 2nd seat-back; I moved the 3rd seat back and forth to no avail.I am returning today. Hopefully I will get a full refund from Amazon."
151087,2,"I really like Dr. Sears and thought that a sling designed by him would be great, but I was way wrong. The sling is just too big. I'm fairly tall and the sling hangs down way too low even when I have it adjusted as far up as possible. It is way too big for a newborn (my son weighed 7 lbs at birth) and is still too big for my son at 3 months. My baby doesn't feel secure in it and I end up having to hold him with at least one arm anyway, which defeats the purpose of the sling. I tried the New Natives sling and am much happier. You just order your size- no adjusting and the baby fits securely in a pouch. I've also heard that hotslings are much better."
38631,1,"Our son LOVES taking a bath and it's worry-free for us, thanks to the Safer Bather. This leight-weight bath pillow is perfect for baths in the kitchen sink or inside another tub. Although our son still fits in the kitchen sink with it, we bought it along with the Primo baby tub and it's an ideal match together.The soft pillow protects our son's head and little body from the sink/tub. There is a little sunken-in area for his little bottom and he LOVES to sit in it and splash around while we bathe him. After the bath, we simply give it a squeeze and hang it in the shower to drip-dry overnight. It can be machine washed but will pill-up if it goes through the dryer. (still works beautifully, though.)This is a FANTASTIC product to bring while traveling - it's allowed us to give him his bath while on vacation or at grandma's house.I HIGHLY recommend this product!"
82822,1,"we use it every night and at every nap. helps cover up creaky floorboards, traffic noises, etc and is so cute!!!"
36153,2,Material waaaay to thin and flimsy. Ring does not hold weight of a baby. Baby could easily fall right out. Instructions terrible. Immediately bought me a Mosby wrap to use instead of this crap.
49131,1,"This is a brightly colored, inviting play-yard. It does what it needs to do by corraling little ones into a designated play area. However, it's hard plastic and not very pliable. It only folds ONE way but that's not really clear, since either way you try to fold it is met with resistance and just feels wrong. Thus, I used it once and the plastic snapped when I attempted to put it away. When it breaks, it's dangerous because the plastic is so hard and creates jagged edges. Thus, the extension gates I bought to make it bigger, actually served as replacement parts. I will leave it set-up all the time now and let it do the job for which it was intended!"
123019,1,"Alright - for everyone complaining, here's my take on this product. It is simply fantastic. Here's why:* You can choose to use the music/sensor feature (shut it off if it's distracting!)* It's easy to clean! Potty only goes in the potty! Simple to rinse and clean. No mess, no hassle. Hard plastic is easy to wipe down with a disinfecting wipe.*The splash guard comes off so if you don't need it, or it's distracting, you can remove it. My son never used it*The base comes off and it clips right on to your big potty! HUGE advantage! We have potty seats for all the other bathrooms except my sons (where most of the potty training happens) so having his own chair to grow into is huge! We used it with the base when he was starting, but then used it on the potty when he was ready. Makes potty time easy!*Songs help pass the time. Even mommy gets tired of waiting! The cheerful potty time songs make the time go by fasterThis chair makes going potty easy! We love it! Thanks Fisher-Price for another great product!"
85248,0,This was comfortable but huge. My husband couldn't sleep in our queen bed when I used it. You need a cal king with this thing but it did give me support for my belly and doesn't go flat.
98434,1,I've owned this AVENT sterilizer for almost 2 months now and i might say that i am truly satisfied. I haven't had any problems with it. Time to complete the sterilization is pretty fast. The only drawback is sometimes it does not give the sterilizing mode you want if you press the button too long.
36023,1,This is so much better than the thin little pad that was on the dressing table top originally.
86019,2,"For us, this monitor was great, until after about 6 months on both units.The video works great, the sound is very good, and the quality is perfect for us. The problems started when, after six months, the video on/off button stopped working. It would only work when it was plugged in, which meant we had no use of the video when it was unplugged.We thought, it was probably just a defective one, and we'll get a replacement. So we did.Again, 6 months after we had it, we had another issue. This time, the volume stopped working. It would suddenly cut out for minutes at a time, or we would have it all the way up, but only hear just a little bit, then suddenly the volume would kick it.We finally are receiving a full refund and getting another brand altogether. Two units in under a year is too much for us.Also, with only 2 channels, we also picked up on other monitors in our area at times. We would be able to watch another families baby, which was really creepy and made us realize that they could do the same. I will not be purchasing Summer products again."
109978,2,"We spent hours trying to get this item together, with no luck. The holes do not line up and the pieces broke while trying to put it together. We have bought numerous ""make it yourself furniture"" and this is the only piece we couldn't put together without breaking it. Not worth the time trying to put it together. We never did get it together. It is now in the landfill."
153271,2,paint is smudged and incomplete It is clearly an imperfection and will be returned Poor Quality I am very disappointed
124448,1,"Very nice cart cover. Well padded, right down to the attached pillow. Packs up easily when not in use. Nice fabric!!"
31890,2,"We bought the blue ""Active"" carrier. Once we opened it, it was by far more purple than blue. It definitely isn't the same color of the photos. That's the only reason for it's markdown in stars. The design of the actual BabyBjorn Baby Carrier Active is excellent. Definitely a five star design. We returned the ""blue"" one and shopped a bit more. We finally designed to get the ""Synergy"" design, which combines the ergonomic design of the ""Active"" and the breathability of the ""Air"" fabric. Hope this helps you guys..."
176436,2,"This breast pump terribly disappointed me. Although it is a one-sided pump (for one breast at a time), you have to hold it with both hands for it to sit tightly. Having a little baby around makes me wish to have at least one hand free at all times - but not with this pump! The material appears to be so cheap, light and thin that I was afraid to break it while using.I have used other breast pumps, but this one is the worst. I managed to get only 1/2 of the milk amount out of my breasts of what I usually pump. Even if you use it only from time to time, this pump is absolutely inadequate. And by the way - pumping doesn't have to hurt as much as it does with this pump!Ladies - save your money and buy a different product!"
72793,0,"The original battery on mine did not last long either, but it is possible to replace it. To start, you need to push the blue cylinder in the center of the turtle that contains the electronics down and out of the turtle. From there, use a very thin bladed screwdriver to separate the top part of the cylinder from the bottom at the obvious seam in the middle. The top part lifts out from the bottom, and you can see two wires running from the top half with the electronics to the bottom half that has the temp probe. On the under side of the top half you will see a large round battery in a 4-prong housing. It is a CR2450 battery which can be purchased right here on Amazon or can be found locally at Radio Shack. Also, if you have water/moisture where the numbers display on the screen you can pry the top cover off from the rest of the top electronics part and dry it out. If you want to be really thorough you can take off the 4 screws that you can see on the circuit board and clean/dry-off the contacts between the battery/circuit board and display. You can have your turtle up and running again in 5 minutes! Hope this helps..."
21138,0,"I really love this lotion and bought this because it is in a pump bottle that is great for my desk. However, it is overpriced. You can get the exact same lotion in a flip-top bottle marketed until the name Johnson's Creamy Baby Oil. It is cheaper and is very deceptive marketing on the behalf of Johnson &amp; Johnson."
49800,0,"This product works well for the toddler set. I was surprised when the 5 yr old could open it. However, our determined little guy kept yanking and eventually broke the glue strength down. We have since SCREWED the product into the refrigerator and it works great! Now if the 5 yr old would just stop letting his brother in... we'd be golden!"
5623,1,"We have the one that is just the part for the tub with the mesh bag (no kneeler). We like it. It fit our tub. We could fit a few toys and bath books in the mesh pockets on the inside of the tub, and could easily fit soap, shampoo, and baby oil in the outer mesh pockets. The only reason we quit using this was that when our one daughter hit about 9 mos. she thought it was really fun to yank the suction cups loose and fling it...especially when we had our hands full with her sister. We'll probably put it back on the tub once they find something new to throw about in the tub."
182822,1,"The only overnight product that keeps my daughter from overflowing her diaper throughout the night. Without these we would have been changing the sheets every morning. My daughter at a very young age was able to produce enough liquid during the night to wet through every diaper we tried - except these. They have recently become nearly impossible to find except online. Worth every penny. Peace of mind and a dry baby in the morning. Great Job, Huggies. These are my favorite diapers."
125743,1,I bought this product for my daughter and her new baby. She really liked the footprint on the cover. The areas to fill in are good. It fit the bill for what I was looking for.
18177,2,"I am a big fan of the ""Baby Einstein"" products and thought I couldn't go wrong with this one. Unfortunately, it overstimulated my daughter. I think it was all the bright colors and the little star that lights up and plays music hangs down too low. My daughter would scream after about 2 minutes when laid down on this play gym. She never used it longer than 5 minutes. Now that she is 5 months old, she does sit up on the mat and chew on the star for short periods and the toys detach and we have got some use out of those. But overall, I would not recommend it."
18861,2,"I usually love The First Years products. I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it. I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one. I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one. Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one. Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair. You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide. At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure. Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray. The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down. You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level. And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model. Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat."
137750,1,"This is definitely my new kids go-to gift! It's soft and light, incredibly easy to operate and just oh so cool. The constellations are a bit difficult to make out, but it's fun to try. Simply turn your turtle around and you're looking a different view of the starry sky."
145078,1,"A friend of mine has one of these & my daughter LOVES it! She's 13 months and can walk and she still loves playing in it every time we go over! She will stay in it for 30 minutes or more with no problem! It is wonderful.When it came time to buy my daughter a stationary activity center I bought this: [[ASIN:B007700RN6 Bright Starts Entertain and Grow Saucer, Pink]. It has a lot of good qualities and my daughter loved playing in it... until she got more mobile. Now, we use it as a way to keep her in one place while I cook or need to keep her out of things. She is pretty much over it & will only sit in it for a short amount of time. If i would have known better, I'd have gotten the Jumperoo."
156104,1,He's 10 months now (purchased about 6 months ago) and he still plays with this! I would recommend this over just about any other teether. It's flexible so it keeps them interested and it has different textures on it as well
4694,1,"I've used a few different brands of diapers in my day, but I wish I had known about this brand before my three kids were potty trained... well, I'm not sure if they made it when my 25 year old was little. BUT, at least my granddaughter has the pleasure of experiencing the eco-friendly diaper for herself. She just loves using them up. ;-DI hesitated to try these as I have tried ""natural"" items like these before (personal feminine items, shampoos, deodorants, etc. that just didn't work well...) But I was pleasantly surprised by this wonderful product. It is a very well made diaper. The baby has fewer blowouts in these diapers... On the rare occasions where we get caught without a diaper and have to borrow a ""regular"" diaper from someone who still buys Huggies or whatever, we always try to rush home to get our trusty 7th Generation diapers because we know if she goes, there won't be a mess. They are softer than I expected them to be for brown diapers. Keeps wetness away... they breathe well and she's has not had even one rash so far. And the thought of putting a diaper that has been processed with chlorine next to my sweet grandbaby's bottom... well, it's just unsavory. The only problem I've had with these diapers is keeping them stocked because my youngest daughter likes to swipe them to put on her dress-up teddy bear.The price on Amazon is better than I can find anywhere, especially with the subscription rate of an extra 15% off to have it shipped automatically! If we have any leftovers when we switch to a larger size, we'll give them as shower gifts in a nice basket with some Burt's Bees and some other nice eco-friendly items... so they don't get wasted."
54330,1,"Our 6-week-old is entranced by this mobile; it holds his attention for the entire 15 minutes the music plays and I've even caught him smiling at it. My sister, a cognitive psychologist, explained why the different components of the mobile are attractive and developmentally appropriate for babies, but the main selling point to me is that it gives me time to take a shower. Other good points: the music is not too loud; it is not irritating even when heard multiple times per day; we have not yet needed to replace the batteries; it is sturdy and simple to install. Of course, our baby is only one data point, but I've worked in a NICU and seen many infants enjoying this exact mobile, which is why I registered for it in the first place."
162435,1,"This is a very convenient infant bath tub. Easy to store and easy to wash your infant in. This tub can sit over your kitchen seat. No back aches of bending over the bath tub. My baby has never slipped, nor got caught under my supervision. Also, my baby enjoyed her tub."
174919,1,"We have gone through two of these tubs. They tend to develop leaks easily, thus why we had to get a second one, but the fact we got a second one should say something about how much we enjoyed it. Besides, they're only $14! The squeaking bill on the tub is a treat for kids....the tub is deep enough to keep little ones sitting upright. I did tend to find the built in temperature gauge was a little too sensitive. It will say your water is too hot even when it's just right at a luke warm temp. Good product overall. Reduced 1 star for durability problems and temp gauge being off."
81025,0,"I have tried this seat on potties in public and not all that satisfied with it, it tends to bend when she moves causes her to almost fall in the potty. SO NOT WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN. Not sure if there is a better option out there or not, I guess we will continue to use this one."
145036,0,This bag was just OK. I found it to be too skinny to be practical as a diaper bag.
106040,1,"...make sure I tell people about this product. I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why. I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs. I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law's house. I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won't have a problem) and it works great, good design!"
72336,1,"The nipple shield was a life saver during the early weeks of breast feeding. It helped my little one find a latch. After several clumsy weeks of popping the nipple shield on and off, my little one had mastered his latch. I was just as happy to be done with the nipple shield as I was to find it."
183281,1,the item I bought was so wonderful it was just what i was looking for thanks for the great speedy service
182450,2,"I've been along time fan of this product, until they recently changed their formula. Now, every bottle that I buy is like water! You can't even blow bubbles with it! So I contacted California Baby, asking for a reason. Someone named ""Sue"" responded, and said that she would send me postage paid envelope to return the bottles I had. It's been a month now, and no envelope has arrived. Now when I email ""Sue"" about it, she either ignores me, or places the blame on another department in the company. So I'm still without bubbles, and it looks like CA Baby still has my money. I feel gipped!"
52660,0,"This seat is a very comfortable seat for babies, especially newborns. It does provide another place for them to sleep. The only downfall is once they start to move (like kick their legs) this seat is stationary and does not move like a bouncer. Carter's makes a seat with the same comforts as this papasan but also bounces and I would recommend it over this one."
39269,0,"I ordered two of these for our twins figuring they could help soothe them when I was too tired (or unable) to keep a hand on them. From the picture, I thought they would have some kind of poseable wire inside but they are just a bean bag like sack. It's hard to keep the beans inside the fingers to make it feel like a hand. A simple sock filled with beans would feel the same, and cost a lot less. I suppose it wouldn't be washable but just as good in my opinion."
158727,1,"With SIDS to worry about, I really do sleep more soundly at night knowing that my baby is warm but not at risk of being smothered by a loose blanket. The bottom-to-top zipper really is convenient for diaper changes, and while the sleepsack did shrink somewhat in the wash, that really hasn't affected its fit on our baby. We went from a fleece sleepsack (infant size) to a cotton one (medium) when the weather started getting warm. Our baby is big (11 lbs 22 1/2 inches at 6 weeks), so we got a medium (one size larger than recommended) hoping it would fit all summer. We shouldn't have worried. The sizes are very generous, but even a very big sleepsack works - there's enough room to grow into without being loose enough at the arm- or neckholes to cause tangling or a smothering hazard. Overall, I wouldn't trade the sleepsack for a regular blanket, and I highly recommend it to all parents of infants."
28623,1,Length:: 1:13 MinsHere's my review on the Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman Set. :)
44673,1,My six month old son enjoys this toy a lot. When I put it on his high chair tray he can sometimes break the suction after a few minutes -- but that's what I would expect. It works better if the suction cup is dampened.
184561,0,"I bought both the small and medium size bumpers. They are both too big, even though my tables measured towards the larger sizing. I had to put foam pieces on the corners to take up the slack. I think an extra small size would be better for most people's end tables, since most of the reviews have the same criticism about sizing. Also, I have had them on the tables for 2 months now and they have still not straightened out. The idea is a great one, but the sizing needs to be reevaluated."
113851,1,"We love this booster seat. I got it when my son was 6 months old and we are still using it for him at 16 months of age. It folds up very nicely and one of the straps to hold it onto the chair doubles as a shoulder strap for carrying. It is very easy to clean and having a cover for the tray is nice so that the tray doesn't get dirty when you travel with it.It has a very nice restraint system. It is easy to remove the tray completely to use it as solely a booster seat. It's very durable and has withstood a lot of abuse over time.I've used this seat everywhere with my son: restaurants, over at friends' houses, as a spare seat when we have lots of babies over at our house, and it even fits nicely on a those folding captain's chairs while we are out camping. It is just a really awesome product and I am so glad I bought it!In summary:Pros -- easy to clean- folds up nice and is easy to carry via shoulder strap- easy to set up- very adjustable- can be used as a booster seat without the tray- fits every chair we've ever tried it on- Has a nice tray cover- Has a removable tray insert for easy washing- The raised edge allows toys to be clipped on the edge if they have on of those plastic link rings on themCons-- There haven't been any for us!"
143321,1,"Dr Browns, the bottles you love to hate. This brush is the same that comes with the bottle to clean out the rubber vent and the bottom of the plastic vent. It is one of the 3 different brushes we use to clean the Dr Brown bottles. Just as the ones that come with the bottle, these bend easily and the bristles wear out quickly, it is nice to have spares before the old ones get too gross."
146783,1,"these wipes cure diaper rash all by themselves, even when my A&D ointment wasn't doing the trick. they are so soft and gentle, they are worth every penny."
135217,1,"When my baby was a born I used this pillow constantly! Since you can not take the cover off, I always put a blanket over it. I've spot cleaned it, but it does kinda suck that I can just put it in the wash every once in a while. I am not a crazy germaphobe and with the blanket over it, he never really spit up on it or anything. Before he was mobile he was always lying in his pillow. I will say it's not very good at propping my baby up as he is learning to sit up, he just tumbles over. So as of right now, I use it more as a back cushion. He still nurses but we never use it anymore for that."
86485,0,"We have tried other product before (MOBI) and had too many problems with statics and interference. We were hoping this product would work better but that is not so much different from the previous monitor we used. It is a little bit better because we still can see the image while the other monitor had a lot of issues with the image too. However, it is always very noisy especially at night when we would expect a major use of the monitor. We don't think there is anything better in the market so we will stick with this one."
22584,0,"My son wont sleep in his pack and play because he moves around alot and only being 11 weeks, weve tried to use it on multiple occasions but he just wont stay asleep in it. When he moves his arms or his legs the whole bassinet part will shake waking him up. We dont have a crib yet because im picky and haven't found a white one that I am in love with just yet, but I am hoping he will sleep in that because it wont move when he does. As for now were using a Snugglenest and hes co-sleeping with us. And during naps he will sleep just fine on our bed, So i dont know what is up with the pack and play but I wished it worked as a bassinet better."
73959,1,"My friend has the Baby Trend and this Joovy Caboose is much smaller, easier to collapse, and easier to steer. My 3 year old DS loves it. I can't wait until I have the new baby and can fully use it. When I compared it to the Baby Trend comparable stroller, I am completely satisfied.The only thing I wished the Joovy had (that Baby Trend does have) was a strap that goes across the handlebars in the back, so when my son stands up on the ledge, he doesn't fall back."
7352,1,"We recieved this as a gift when i was pregnant- i liked it at first because the size is PERFECT for the carseat! and now that my son is 6 months old and EVERYTHING goes in his mouth, he is facinated with the tags. they are his favorite part of every toy - so this blanket is perfect!"
95085,1,"This pump is great. I work part time and use to feed my daughter when I'm away. It works well and is compact and quiet. However, it drains batteries after only a few uses, so don't forget the AC adapter! Also, you have to hold it just right so milk doesn't go in the air tube. It's not a big deal to clean- just warm, soapy water and then use a Medela steam bag to get rid of any water inside."
106821,2,"For the first few months, the Diaper Champ did a sufficient enough job of containing the odor. But, as time has passed, I've become disappointed in our purchase. We've used Lysol to clean the unit, and recently, I even soaked it down with bleach. That was not a good idea since I think it contributed to the stinky problem. My husband discovered, upon disassembling to see if he could bring the Champ back to it's original usefulness, that there is a sponge lining in the top.The sponge lining is rotting away. (Hence the bleaching not being the best cleaning route - I think it soaked into the covered/contained sponge, causing it to stink more by having no way to dry out.) I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new ""diaper pail"" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty. One man cited his wife breaking a nail. I don't even have nice/long nails, but I always feared breaking the tip of my fingers off! It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no ""residue"" whatsoever is outside of the diaper. If it gets on the rubber gasket surrounding the weight, it is impossible to get the stink out of that area too. (That's the original reason I tried the bleach solution.)I'm in the process of deciding on which other diaper pail to try."
176460,1,"My wife liked it a lot. It is very compact, very portable but effective. It runs with AC power, or if you want, you can run it with 2 AA batteries!My wife has used the medela symphony model exclusively previously, and she said this model is obviously not ""hospital grade"" but it is sufficient for her to use while at work. She is very happy to use it at work and it gets the job done."
110326,0,"This chair isn't special -- let's be honest, it's not that expensive, so it's hard to expect much, but I admit I hoped for better.My wife and I shopped the baby stores for a rocker for our new baby's nursery, and found the Dutailier ones were nicely sized, very comfortable, and seemingly well constructed. Of course, we also looked at cribs, dressers, and changing tables, and were turned off by how easy it was to spend $3,000 on furniture for a nursery. We don't even have $3,000 worth of furniture in our master bedroom! So we decided to order the furniture off Amazon. We were honestly surprised with the quality of the furniture. Our favorite piece is our $170 crib! Sure, it probably isn't hand-made by a craftsman here in the USA and meant to last for generations, but it looks nice, seems relatively well-constructed, and is pretty indistinguishable from a nicer one. So we hoped that our experience would be the same with this rocker.Unfortunately, that was not the case. The first one that arrived was damaged (broken plastic piece), but Amazon took it back without any issues. We ordered another one which seemed to be from a later batch because it had additional padding around the more fragile pieces. Kudos to Shermag for improving the packaging. Also, the quality of the wood seems to be decent and putting the chair together was straightforward and easy. Sadly, the chair suffers from a few fatal flaws that make it difficult to recommend.First, although we knew the chair didn't recline, the angle of the back is surprisingly upright. It feels kind of like a coach airline seat. With a baby in the arms, it just isn't relaxing to sit there and rock because the weight of the baby has to be supported by your arms instead of by your body.Second, the seat is very narrow. My wife and I are not big people (180 lbs and 150 lbs) and there isn't really any room to move in the chair once seated. Add a baby, and it gets crowded fast. Forget using a boppy to help with the feedings, there's no room for one.Third, the fabric and padding are unimpressive. They feel very cheap and thin. I could've forgiven this if the other two flaws didn't exist, but it adds a bit of insult to the injury.In summary, I didn't expect this chair to equal the nice Dutailier ones in the baby stores. However, the cheapest rockers are in the $100-150 price range, and this one is in the $275-350 price range. It doesn't really measure up for how much it costs, especially considering it's made in China. (As a data point, we also own a Shermag table -- made in the USA -- and it may as well be a completely different company... the quality is not comparable). Bottom line, if you're really on a budget, get a cheap chair in the $100-150 price range. Yes, it will suck, but it's not worth paying double to get something that almost-sucks. Otherwise, just save up and get the Dutailier... you'll be glad you did."
24731,1,"We were given this gate as a shower gift. It is wonderful and easy to install and operate. In fact, so easy and sturdy we purchased a second one for landing at the top of the stairs. Our 9 month old son has been standing for a few months and he really tries to shake this gate and it stays right in place. Very reliable. Wish this company would make a gate for use at the bottom of the stairs that is hands-free!"
146749,1,"I really wasn't sure if my 4-month-old would like this; he seems to hate everything. He's a VERY cranky baby unless entertained by mommy or daddy. I can't get anything done with him! But this turned out to be one of the best toy purchases I've ever made for him.Set-up was very easy and the directions were very straight-forward, though I pretty much only used them for quick reference. I love that assembly is snap-together. You only need a screwdriver to put the batteries (3 AA) in. Once it's assembled, it's big and a little bit of a pain to move but our apartment is really tiny so there's really no need to move it from it's spot in the living room. This may be an issue for others, though. Getting the baby in can be an event but I personally find it much easier to have the seat pad sticking straight up and it does that for you by itself when you pull your little one out.At first, he wasn't sure what to make of all of it and just kind of stared at the lights on the musical toy, which plays very cute music and animal souds in two volumes and two different settings. Pretty soon, he figured out how to spin the little doo-dad on it and was so excited that he could make it turn on. And of course, when little ones get excited, those little legs get a-goin' and he soon discovered the joy of bouncing. I don't think I've ever seen him laugh harder. The racket it makes when it bounces is a little annoying but as long as it makes my baby happy, I don't mind. Right now, he's not much for spinning in the seat so the lizzard and tiger toys have gone ignored for the most part but what he can get his hands on, he loves. He also likes to look up at the stuffed leaf toys.There is one toy that may be a real dud for some kids. There's a little bug on a stem that I'm guessing is supposed to stand up, but it just hangs limp. This was quickly turned into something fun, however, by taking it out of it's slot (this can be done by simply pinching the two plastic tabs on the yellow base) and just handing it to him to play with. It must feel really good on his gums because he just loves to gnaw away on it and look at the high-contrasting black polka-dots on the white wings. It's too bad they didn't stuff cellophane in the wings. He loves crinkly stuff.Not all kids will end up loving this little gem but mine sure does! I can put him down and FINALLY begin the horrid process of cleaning my house which has been neglected for 4 months. That I don't have an excuse anymore is pretty much my only complaint."
111739,1,"I just finished installing this gate all by myself. It was quick and easy ESPECIALLY when you use the enclosed template for the brackets. I don't know why so many people had to jerry-rig this thing--it was a piece of cake to install. The directions are a little vague but if you actually read them, it is easy. It is incredibly sturdy---I put it through its paces myself. I love that it slides out of the hinges when you want it out of the way--this gate has many more features than the box advertises. It swings open either way too. Also, if you leave this gate open for some reason it doesn't swing all over the place, it just stays where it is which to me is a nice little bonus. It is no problem to operate with one hand and given the cheap uneven construction of my military house, the top and bottom still align on the locking side when I want to close it. The template gives you all you need to do this installation right. After installing a Supergate V twice with 16 screws each time, in 1 doorway, only to have it be nearly impossible to open and close with me on my knees and two hands--I am thrilled by this gate and am ready to go back and buy two more."
5550,2,I was searching for an organizer like this for WEEKS and found this and the Dexbaby one (apparently the only 2 made on earth?). This one STINKS and I ended up returning it - then bought the Dexbaby one which is terrific.The problen with this one if that it looks nice and rigid in the picture but you can't put anything in the compartments without it collapsing onto itself because the compartments need to be rigis but they are just canvas. I should have read the reviews first. Simply have no idea and would be so curious to know how a company could create something like this and sell it - if they simply made a prototype and tried to put a box of wipes in the top part they would immediately see it doesn't hold it!?... A discrace to still sell this on the market. Buy the Dexbaby one! Same price - great looking - I got it 48 hours after I ordered it! :)
44401,0,"I was given this sling as a gift with my first child. I loved it when he was a newborn up to about 3 months. After that, he started to get a little too heavy on my shoulder. I had a C-Section with my son and it was just a little uncomfortable on my back when he got to be bigger than about 10 pounds. I could wear it out for a quick errand, but if I had it on more than an hour, my back and shoulders would ache.As a result, I will probably look into a Moby Wrap for our second. Still a great product, just doesn't last and it's not as great on your back!"
152981,1,"My husband refused to drill holes in the cabinets of our new house to install child proofing. This is a great set if you are in the same position or are renting and can't drill. I've used both adhesive and the type with screws (at our previous residence). The adhesive type work very well. I'm surprised at how secure they are. I did buy a roll of adhesive tape at a local store, as I had some trouble installing and with the extra tape I could still install the set even after I ruined the adhesive that came with it. I highly recommend having some extra adhesive tape. Once you install it, it is very sturdy."
48541,1,"My wife and I have a three year old and a now seven month old. When our second was born, we knew he'd be downstairs, a entire floor away from his parents. As a dad who learned a few lessons the first time around, I had no problem shelling out the coin necessary to put my wife's mind at ease.So, was it worth it? Absolutely. The product has performed without a single hiccup. We get great reception, the video is so bright the monitor will wake me up at night when my wife is ""peaking"" on our son. Resolution is very good, the thermal sensor works well, and the audio almost works too well.A tip for use, we originally mounted it about 2 feet above the base of the matress, on the crib. I recently increased the distance to about 4 feet using a broom (my son has learned he can grab the camera). This gives us a much better view of the crib. The point is, test out positioning, and don't be afraid to push the limits of the camera, it can take it.As far as durability, my wife has dropped the handheld monitor too many times to count. And despite my wincing, it still operates flawlessly.As my title suggests, this is a very, very worthy investment!"
42742,0,"Pros: Lightweight, the black color goes with pretty much any outfit I wear. It keeps baby and I very warm. It looks a lot nicer than one of those carriers that you just put on and set the baby in. It is all one piece. Easy to wash and dry.Cons: On a warmer day, it is so unbearably hot to wear. My 4 1/2 month old likes to look around and would like to be facing the other direction. Because of this, he is always leaning heavily to one side, and it feels like he is going to fall out. It is very hard to use this for a newborn because his head is leaning way down in it on an awkward angle. You can only take the baby in and out of it a few times before you have to re-tie the whole thing.Overall: I think I would have found a similar one-piece design that has better capabilities for holding the infant, and one in which I could place the child facing the other direction."
1868,1,"We switched our 16 month old son from the cruisers to the baby dry a few months ago because we got more for our money. I didn't really like the cruisers because they seemed loose around his legs, and we would occasionally get leaks. The baby dry works great for us, no leaks, and it's nice to get a few more diapers per box."
82563,1,"Been using this car seat for about 3 years now. Still looks good. I really like the side wings for my daughter when she falls asleep. Its now converted to a booster seat. Very easy to buckle her in. The five point harness was taken out when she outgrew it. Only carseat I will use. Only con is that the cushion is very thin, but I only had to put some foam under the cushion and that fixed it."
136655,0,"Our baby really enjoyed looking at the screen and listening to the music and stories, however it just seems to drain batteries very quickly."
11967,1,"My son started using this around six months, and he really enjoys it. He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever... Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush. (I am always a little suspicious of something you soak and then it comes out looking white and clean - maybe you just whitened the gunk so you can't see it? So I prefer to physically clean it first.) That works pretty well. It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture."
69641,1,I wanted to let you know that me and my granddaughter really enjoyed this play yard it was larger than we expected nice coloring and sturdy.
51348,2,"I bought this stroller 1 year ago this week. If I had to do it all over again I would not have purchased this stroller. Two sets of wheels have broken within the first 4 months of use: a [...] and newborn. Now 1 year later the back seat is broken in so much that it sags and does not make for a comfortable ride for the backseater. I agree with a previous post about the front rider being able to lock the wheels, HUGE PAIN! Needed to be designed better.For the price, not worth it."
150223,1,"I thought a receiving blanket would work just fine, but when I got this cover that was made for the changer I was so surprised at what a huge diffeence it made! I love this cover and it fits like a glove. Highly recommend this cover for your infant change pad."
45563,1,"This has been the toy we've used the most of all the things we've bought/received for our son. We started putting him in it when he was 2 months old, and he would happily bat and kick at the toys. That moved on to grabbing and pulling the toys, rolling over and exploring the crinkly elephant's ear and the giraffe's tail on his tummy, and grabbing the mirror. The music and lights don't seem to do too much for him, so you could probably get a version without those. It washes well and only faded a little when washed in cold, which I think I've done twice. Good for travel to Grandma's house, since it folds up. He's 6 months old now, and still not bored with it."
127770,1,Tis is a great bed and my daughter used and then it was passed to my son when she upgraded to a twin . It has held up well and very nice looking. Recommend to any one for a toddler
161598,0,"I got this tub at a shower and I wish I would have taken it out of the box earlier so that I could investigate it and return it. The tub is very hard to extend and put away. It is so hard to take down that I just leave mine out all the time. The seams in the tub make it hard to keep clean. I also have a problem with the seams leaking, even though I have the tub completely together.The reclining part of the tub is good and comfortable for the small baby, however it is not very secure on the top. Now that my girl is older and sitting up, I tried the ring and she hates it. The plastic has some hard edges and she got two scratches on her the first time I put her in it. My girl is a very active baby and I just did not feel that she was secure enough in this position. I have recently taken out the reclining part and an using it in our bath. She likes this better and is able to splash and play around.I would not buy this tub for anyone because it is very hard to use."
131350,0,"It is a good product, nicely made but after using it only for a couple of weeks, I uninstalled my son's car seat and I noticed that it doesn't protect completely the leather from my back seat. What I found is a couple of dents from the pressure made by the car seat I thought they would come to normality if I gave it some time for the foam to react, but no it didn't. You want protection for your car? put a peace of card board underneath the car seat."
50705,0,"The Leachco body pillow is okay although I cannot compare it to other body pillows. I say just okay b/c it really has not helped me to get comfortable in bed as I progress through my pregnancy. I wish it were fluffier and the cover that comes with it was not as ""rough"" as some reviewers put it. It is helpful to use when hanging out on the couch and when lying down on the couch as well otherwise, I would tell people to go to an actual store and try out pillows for comfort, ect. b/c when you order on line, you are taking a guess..."
29188,0,"I have bought only BabyBjorn potty products- the toilet trainer, potty chair & safe step. This is a good product but is too short for my 2 yr old to reach the adult toilet safely. It has a nice non-skid top & bottom & stays put which is great & very important for safety. Maybe it will work in somone else's house, but it is a bad fit for mine."
55290,1,"I am an exclusive pumper, going on two months now, and have an oversupply ""problem."" I pump with a hands-free bra on the way to/from work. After overflowing one of the ameda bottles in a very messy drive home, I decided I needed to pump into bigger bottles. I feed my daughter with Avent bottles and these have allowed me to pump directly into a 9oz bottle for feedings. They are great!I highly recommend them to all pumping mothers!"
95788,1,I used Avent and Dr. Brown for my first daughter and did some research about bottles for my next baby. She loves these bottles and so do I!!! She is not gassy at all!
82147,0,We purchased these--fairly easy to install as long as you have a drill. Keeping baby out so far. Used when tot locks were to hard to locate with magnet-better than them by far.
176260,1,I love to use these diapers as burp cloths. They are nice and big and protect both your clothes and the baby's. They are nice and soft while still being absorbent. I can't comment on using them as diapers because I have only ever used them as burp cloths. The cloths wash up nicely and I am always carrying a few of them around with me even as my baby gets older and they are great to clean up spills as well!
165541,1,I tried every brand of diaper for my daughter but these are the only ones that would cut it and always came back to them. They worked for 12 hour sleeping periods and day time play with no leaks. Worth the money for the comfort and security
149830,1,"Depending on your carseat it might not work as well. Reclined seats don't really work with it. Bought it to use on a cross country trip with a 2 yr old. Worked ok. She didn't really like it on her lap, not sure why. And it Deana really store easily. It is very safe though, being just rigid enough to be able to color on but not so rigid to cause issues in case of accident"
19567,1,"I bought the Booby Tubes becacuse my milk supply was going down. . .Before my son was born I knew I wanted to breastfeed and my goal is to make it to one year. When my son was 3 months old I went back to work full time. I breastfeed him when I am home and he drinks pumped milk when I am working. I pump 3 times a day when I am at work and after about a month and a half of doing this I noticed that my milk supply was dwindling. So, after reading the reviews, I decided to give Booby Tubes a try and I am so glad that I did. I pop them in the microwave and put them on as I am getting my breast pump ready. I leave them on while I am pumping and I am pumping twice as much as I was right before I tried the tubes. I have now been using them for a couple of weeks and am pumping plenty of milk for my beautiful baby boy!"
12704,2,I wish I had read the reviews on this website before I bought this product. I was so excited after hearing my baby's heartbeat at the doctor's office that I ran right out and bought this product when I was just 3 months pregnant. When I got it home and read the directions I learned that it wouldn't work until I was at least 5 months pregnant. I started using it at five months and still to this day 32 weeks into my pregnancy have never heard my baby's hearbeat using this product. All my husband and I have ever heard is loud clicking noises when pushing the button and static every time the cord moves slightly. Don't waste your money!
95594,0,"Not very impressed with this because the directions did not really tell you the best way to hang it, so you have to wing it. The first time hanging it, it was all messed up."
17830,2,"Shortly after turning this on in the night mode (with the lights), I heard a continuous clicking and it stopped spinning. I had to coax it along with my hands. This happened over and over until I took it back and exchanged it. The second mobile had the exact same problem so it went back for a refund. It's too bad -- if it were made well it would be a nice mobile. FOr $40 you'd think the product would at least work for a couple of days!"
182173,1,"the wipes warmer is a must for the baby. a warm wipe to your baby's tooshie in the middle of the night will help prevent them from waking up too much. the replacement pillows do turn brown a little, but that's normal. the wipes never dry out or burn. just make sure you moisten the pillow once a week."
34490,1,"Just got the Wub today. It turns out the attached pacifier is the exact same brand of newborn paci we've been using, so baby already loves the pacifier. The attached pink horse is adorable and stays on her tummy when she spits the paci out instead of falling to the floor. The only reason (and this is kind of a big reason) I took a star off is that the horse's back seam was wide open when I recieved it. It's too much trouble to send it back so I'm just going to stitch it up myself."
89492,2,I signed up with subscribe and save and receive a case of pampers every 2 months or more frequently. When i signed up i thought i was locking in my rate at the price given then and did notice that it fluctuated by a minimal amount. Now when i received my order once again i was disappointed to notice that the price went up a lot about $10 since I started ordering here. By now the price in not so cheap and i may buy elsewhere.
81434,1,"We have had this stroller for almost 3 years now and have had no problems with it. The seat material has worn through on the front, exposing the bar under the seat, but that's about it. I even accidentally ran over the wheel with my car and we were able to fix it and it still rides just fine! I love the recline that it allows for kids to nap. We're just about to have our second baby and so have upgraded to a double stroller, but I'm sure this will still get plenty of use. I walk every day during the summer and it has been my best friend. The cargo area is also really nice sized, much better than our new double stroller."
151590,1,"I apply this twice a day with Earth Mama Angel Baby Earth Mama Body Butter. I'm 35 weeks pregnancy and I don't have any stretch mark yet! Smells good and it's very rich, but not sticky."
26472,0,For the price of the item it's not worth it.It's completely old fashion and in this modernised world I shouldn't have to spend majority of my time rocking this bassinet.The storage below is perfect for her extras
74453,0,"I bought this after researching diaper bags. I wanted a backpack style that had compartments for everything. This is pretty roomy inside, and has handy front pouch that you can get into for diaper changes. I like the size and some of the features, but the big drawbacks for me are: the backpack strap hinge broke after the first 2 months. (i was able to repare it.) And it is a very ""stiff"" bag, meaning I can't stuff it under my stroller. It's nice looking, but I realize now that I was wanting something that I could throw on my back and stuff in the car and stroller...this bag is not it."
175188,1,The princesses are a really nice size. The graphics are colorful and the faces aren't too weird looking. We placed these on our 2 year-old daughter's headboard. Haven't tried to remove the decals yet so I cannot comment on the removabilty factor or if a residue is left behind (like some of the RoomMates decals). The decals are very thin and rip easily (a star deducted for this con) so take your time peeling them off their backing.
30450,1,This tub is great. Buy it. It makes bath time much easier. The hammock allows for just the right amount of water for newborns and infants baby.
107367,0,"We bought this because we needed a first floor diaper pail. And the Diaper Genie was a bit hard to use, so we tried this one. While this is very easy to use (one-handed), after 36-48 hours, it smells really bad!! So we have to change the bag in it very frequently. Oh well, I'd still recommend it. You just may have to buy stock in air fresheners as well. And we even bag our smelly diapers before putting them in."
101555,1,I love the modern look of this drying rack. Skip Hop is one of my favorite baby gear companies. It came looking just as I thought it would. The only problem I have with it is that I wish it were a bit more sturdy for my glass bottles. Would recommend it more for someone using plastic bottles but will still work for glass.
59356,1,"I use this with a changing table and it really keeps the diapers, the wipes and all the lotions/desitin together in one place making diaper changing simple and quick without being too bulky or taking up too much space!"
1826,1,I am a big pampers fan. My son doesn't leak through these diapers like he does with huggies and other brands and they don't give off that funky old lee smell when he wets. Plus they are not as bulky as other brands.
6344,2,"I bought and loved this monitor--at first. Then the picture started to get worse and worse until it was unusable at 13 months (just 1 month past the 12 month warranty!). So I bought another, and the same thing happened, but this one only lasted 9 months! For $150 dollars, you'd think they could make them to last more than a few months. Save the headache and your money, and buy a reliable unit instead."
120111,1,"My husband and I bought these bottles based on a friend's recommendation. She swore they reduced her baby's spitting up, gas, and fussiness when feeding. Boy was she right! After trying other bottles by VentAire and Gerber, these are the only ones we'll use. With other bottles, our son would get rather gassy, but not with Dr. Brown's bottles. These are great!"
14749,2,"These bottles leak like crazy... and they are/were (at the time of this review) made from potentially unsafe plastics (PVC, phtalates). I would stay away from this brand. We've been very happy with First Years Soothies instead."
175426,0,"With a newborn I think everything is trial in error, but I have found these covers to ""leak"" often. When they are wet around the legs they seep onto the cloths. As he gets bigger it happens less, and I'm sure it has to do with the diaper I am using, but I feel the cover should contain more moisture. I feel it's an alright product for the price."
161687,1,"I am really surprised by the other negative reviews this tub has received. My baby is 10 months old now and we have been using this since she was 2 months old. I miss it when we travel.1. Water does NOT leak when it is completely extended and the center pressed down into place at the center as per instructions. There have been times I have forgotten to unplug the drain on this thing and I have seen the water level almost unchanged after several hours.2. The rubber suctions on the bottom are so sticky that I often fight with it to remove it to use the tub myself as you have to peal a the corners and keep it up while peeling other corners. I personally have considered removing 2 of the suctions to make my life easier but while still retaining the stickiness. When our baby was little and couldn't sit up, we even had this tub stuck to a sturdy table so that it is easier to bath her with her being at our arms height, and we would not have done so if we had any doubt that the suction cups weren't stuck a 100% If you try the same please ensure that there is no chance that the tub moves even an iota of an inch.3. The supportive frame with the net type fabric has been a blessing when she was little and also now when I have to wash her hair. It is easy to secure the frame it by pushing down in the center when the frame meets the center bump. Do make sure to was this regularly and also keep it dry after bath (hang it with it on the frame itself if necessary). Baby is very comfortable laying on it (till she could sit up) and using it as a parent was a breeze.4. I have never felt that the tub was too big or little from the time she was 2 months till now.I wonder if there are multiple versions of this tub and if we just got lucky by getting a great version."
165419,0,My baby is almost 4 months old and I just tried these 2 weeks ago. Still not 100% positive if it is a coincidence or not but my baby never had diaper rash before using these diapers. They fit well and hold a lot of fluid but having my baby cry because of diaper rash is not worth it.Other diapers we have used without diaper rash:Pampers SwaddlersHonest Brand Diapers.*** I gave it 3 stars because I am not 100% positive but I don't plan on using these again.
128516,1,"I purchased these bottles after hear that toxins can leak into the milk from plastic bottles. These are very nice, thick glass bottles. They do come with a rubber nipple, so if your baby is used to silicone nipples you will need to purchase them separatly."
83502,2,"This bed rail is the absolute worst. It does not lock properly. When you throw all your weight on one side to push it down to lock it, it will lock. But once you go to the other side to lock it, the first side pops up and unlocks. It's like a comedy routine. You may get it to seemingly lock on both sides, but one side will unlock at some point on its own.Also, this rail sits on top of the bed, so your blankets get pinned down on one side. If you were to use 2 rails, you could never get the covers up. The rails also sit in several inches, so a single bed gets very narrow.This product is unsafe, and with serious design flaws. Save yourself the frustration of putting it together, wrestling with it, and returning it."
104880,1,"The Athena Anna Sleigh Toddler bed in white is an attractive and sturdy bed. It does fit a standard crib mattress and sheets. From reading the item description before ordering, I expected the bottom to be a solid piece of wood. The bottom is made of slats. The instructions for putting the bed together are not well written. The construction required two adults and considerable time. The finished product is satisfactory."
14133,1,"These bottles are great! My breastfed baby took to them very easily, and now that she's older, the 4oz size makes a very good container to put cereal and other solid foods in (with the sealing discs). A benefit to these bottles is their ability to effectively and easily reduce the amount of air the baby swallows. As she is drinking from the bottle, you can actually see the air bubbles being released into the bottle in between sucks.In response to other posts about the bottles leaking, we have only used these bottles, and they have never leaked (even with mommy hurrying to pack bottles when running late). I have even dropped a bottle full of milk on the floor (several times), no leaks!I love that you can interchange the nipples and sealing discs, so I can have bottles or storage containers, depending on what I need! I also bought the Avent Breastpump Conversion kit ($9), so I can use my Medela pump to pump directly into the Avent bottles.All the bottle parts are dishwasher-safe, but I choose to clean the nipples myself with a nipple brush, just to be thorough. The rings, sealing discs, caps, and bottles themselves clean up very well in the dishwasher.These bottles are durable! Like I said, I have dropped them on the floor, pumped into them, run them through the dishwasher, sterilized them, boiled them (before I had a sterilizer), and they don't show any signs of wear at all! The bottles themselves are a very hard plastic, which can go through several babies without any problems. The nipples are a softer silicone, but are thick enough that they hold up great too."
99031,1,This was an awesome deal on diapers! This is how I will buy them from now on!
161486,0,We received this tub as a shower gift. I was very pleased with it until I realized that it was leaking! We wanted to return it purchase one of the many better made tubs out there but we threw away the box. I now give him baths in the kitchen sink. I would not recommend this product.
31906,0,"i've always been told the safest plastic options (for reusability) are the numbers, 2, 4 & 5. And on the medela bottles (5 ounce) that came with the pump, this is the case (i believe they use #4 plastic). However, with these bottles under the cap in the little triangle i noticed the number 7.This makes me a little nervous to use them. The milk always ends up touching the lid... i know they say the bottles are BPA free, but does that count for the lid too?Why would Medela make the bottle lids out of a different material from their regular bottle lids.I think i will stop using them.#7 plastic is also very difficult to recycle."
56049,0,"As many others have stated, this gate is not exactly easy to install. I installed it at the bottom of my stairs, and rather than paying 50 dollars for the stairway installation kit, i just drilled into the banister at the bottom of the stairs. That wasn't the issue - the directions were vague, and the screws that came with the gate are not appropriate for certain situations.The screws were fine for the holes I had to drill in my banisters. But they did not work at all on the dry wall side. Intitially, I used anchors with the screws...The bottom part kept falling out of the wall and the gate would not work. I finally moved it over a half an inch, and used dry wall screws with no anchor, and it seems to be working perfect.Good news - when this gate is installed correctly (you'll likely have to figure out some stuff on your own) it works great. we bought it because we didn't want a bar going across the top or bottom of the stairs. Now that it is working properly, it is great. Just be prepared for some obstacles when installing.Also, the ""stoppers"" I found to be virtually worthless. They didn't seem to work so I used a screw and just let it stick out far enough to stop the gate from going the other way."
165724,1,"Not as soft as Pampers Swaddler, but I prefer them to the regular Huggies and like them equally as the Huggies Little Snugglers which are much more expensive. Very absorbent, never got a leak with them and my baby sleeps for 12 hours at night."
60635,1,"Wow -- where do I begin? This tub is, hands down, the very best bathtub on the market. We bought this tub before our daughter (first child) was born. We chose it based on the rave reviews of a trusted friend and the advice of NICU nurses in a baby preparation class we took. After 22 months of use, this tub is still in perfect condition and our daughter still fits in it with room to spare. This tub allows you to wash your child with at least one, if not both, hands free. The baby sits in what reminds me of a western-style saddle with the piece in front that won't let baby slip down -- even as a newborn. Our daughter's very first bath was in this tub just the way it's pictured here (no infant insert needed). She'll be 22 months-old next week and still fits in this tub. We expect she'll fit in this tub well past her 2nd birthday. Now THAT'S what I call bang for your buck.We got one of those inflatable duck tubs for our daughter's first birthday as a gift. We blew it up tonight thinking maybe we'd start putting her in the adult tub with the duck since she splashes us a lot now and soaks the walls when we use the eurobath on the bathroom counter top. To our dismay, we found that the duck inflatable tub was way too small. We assume other inflatable tubs will be too per their dimensions. In addition, the duck tub was so narrow that our daughter's bath toys would have been piled up on her lap. In the eurobath, even at nearly two, she still has plenty of room to sit and play with all manner of bath toys. She sits confidently in the eurobath because she's supported so there's no slipping and scaring her, and there's no worry for us. I can wash her hair and her body without holding onto her or worrying she'll slide and bump her head, etc. We'll probably just start putting the eurobath in the adult tub for a while now until she outgrows it.I cannot say enough good about this tub. You WILL NOT find a better tub out there because it just doesn't exist. Other tubs may have ""spa"" features or temperature devices but they don't hold a candle to this tub. You can buy a cheap rubber duckie bath water thermometer at any baby store and they work fine. This is just the best design on the market and you will thank yourself time again, probably for two years or more, for buying this tub. We do, that's for certain."
86872,1,"The Drop-Ins idea is great in itself, but we're unable to refrigerate these as we can other bottles. The breast milk begins to clot on the sides unless the milk is used right away.My 2-month old daughter didn't initially like these, but after a couple more uses, we found that she had an easier time drinking from these than Similac or Medela's bottles, which are two of our other options. The Avent ones measure up nicely, but what we like about the Playtex Drop Ins is that our daughter won't suck in as much air as she might from other bottles.Yes, they can measure expensively in the long run, but we'd prefer that over our daughter, who drinks a ton, drinking in too much air."
27748,0,"I love everything about this stroller for my 2 yr. old twins. It turns on a dime, it's comfy for the kids and doesn't hurt my back to push it all over Disneyland; but, it is too wide. I'd like to take two inches off the width."
148028,1,"I purchased this when my son was 3 months old. He's now 4 months old and loves this. We use it everyday, several times to entertain him while I do dishes, check email or whatever. I recommend this."
141838,2,I bought this hoping to stop my baby boy from chewing on his side rails....little did I know that it wouldn't stick even though I let it cure for more than 12 hours! When it came off it took most of the paint off of the side rail with it!!!! So I tried it again with a new piece and this time let it set and cure for even longer with vices pressing it down in various places...it STILL didn't stay on and just took more paint with it!!! Seriously do not waste your time with this extremely sub-par product!-a VERY dissatisfied customer!!!!
11235,1,My little niece of 18 months is kept quite dry while using these swimpants in her parents pool. My sister still cannot believe how dry (if she hasn't done anything) the swimpants keep her daughter. Great fit and quality. Highly recommend.
42776,2,"This thing is so long and is not user friendly. It is frustrating when trying to get things in order out in public and trying to deal with this VERY long chunk of fabric. When the ground is wet and the fabric is draped all over it, it doesn't go well. Would NOT recommend to anyone!"
98464,1,"I gave 5 stars, considering reviews of others who own/use it and don't want to lower the ratings in any way, considering this is definitely a good product. But, what about the cost of this? Just think, is it really worth it? All families have a microwave these days. They are the FINEST AND BEST STERILIZERS anywhere! If you can get a dedicated sterilized and clean container, microwave safe, wash and rinse all the baby bottles, nipples, etc. (the washing part anyways one has to do, irrespective of whether they use this product or not) and place them in this microwave safe container, run it in microwave for no more than 40 to 50 seconds - violla - all items are absolutely sterilized.Those who might not be aware, microwaves kill 99.9% of all germs within 20 seconds of exposure. In fact, a very common practice is to microwave the cloth or sponge one uses to rinse/clean utensils for 20 seconds to get it sterilized. Think what 40 to 50 seconds will do to the bottles, etc.........Completely disinfect them. You save (say) $70.00 ($4.00 for the Target bought microwave safe container, with lid and big enough to hold the bottles, lying down)[Edit, after reading comments on original review, as above]I agree, it was my fault and mistake to miss out a critical and vital point and those who have commented on that - I thank you! The above review had a critical pt. missing - one should never, ever microwave ONLY the product in question, i.e. bottles, nipples, etc. What I really meant was what I use, i.e. I have a container, where I put all the baby stuff in, pour about 7 to 8 oz. of water and m/w for 8 min., which steams out the water and steams out everything, thus sterilizing.The cost of the container was $3.00. Sorry - my bad. So, what I really wanted to say was is the price worth it? As for time involved, it takes just the same. Effort - also."
178796,0,"We were only to use it when our son is 5 weeks old till he was 3 months old (16 lbs), it's good for newborn who's able to support his own head and he felt alseep in it while where him. Once the baby is over 15lbs, you'll feel most of the weights are on your back and shoulder. Like child birth isn't enough of a strain on mom's back already, this is NOT designed for wearing a long period of time (15 mins and longer). We just purchased the Cybex 2.GO baby carrier from a local store to replace Bjorn original. We were able to try on the Cybex at the store, weights are much well distributed on your hips and shoulder. If you plan on wearing your baby for more than 3 months, I wouldn't recommend Baby Bjorn Original. Try Ergo, Beco or Cybex instead."
21880,2,"I bought this for my 15 month old daughter who spent the week of our vacation sooooo uncomfortable and her mother spent the week being nervous about her saftey. Despite reading the directions several times and many readjustments I was never happy with its placement, it moved way more than I was comfortable with. The idea is great and it fit nicely in the front of my suitcase but I will never use it again and would never recommend it to anyone."
130140,1,"My last experience with baby swings was in the 1980's when they could hold the weight of a small adult. I'm told this is very sturdy for a swing, so I guess for a plastic one that can hold only 25 lbs. this is a great buy. I found it awkward to put together. If you have two people you're much better off. I love looking at this swing; it's enchanting. Now that it's together I can't wait for baby to try it. Still waiting for baby to come..."
128098,1,Just what you need for the braun ear thermometer. Snaps on easy and discards easy. No problems with this.
116820,2,"I just got mine in the mail and was very suprised to see that it doesn't close well and doesn't have a toggle. The other one I bought from Blueberry is much nicer, and I am not sure this one will work for us."
51207,1,"Before I bought this pillow, I was having a lot of trouble sleeping through the night, and would wake up many times during the night with pain/discomfort. I bought this pillow when I was about 5 months pregnant, and now I sleep through the night almost every night, with only an occasional discomfort. This pillow allows two main sleeping positions - hugging the long part against your stomach or putting the long part against your back for back support. Having these two options is great, as if one isn't comfortable, the other usually is. Definitely worth the money!"
41885,1,I have not actually used this product...it is part of a gift for a 'as yet unborn' grandchild.I can review the service as prompt and fulfilled as presented. Usage review will be a few months down the road and would have to come from the parents who will use it. :-)
82107,1,"Our daughter, sadly, had difficulty sleeping because of a terrible tragic incident. We bought her this and this was the first place she could sleep on her own. She curled up as the princess in her own castle and felt safe. I say all this because we were absolutely desperate and for anyone else with a traumatized young child, this worked for us and most importantly- for her. God bless."
52576,0,"This swing is very cute, plays nice soothing music and is a good small size. My complaint about this swing is that the fish toys that hang down from the top carrying bar get in his way and rub against his face when he is in the swing. I wish there was a way that they could detatch or at least wind up out of the way of my baby. When you use the swing to calm a fussy baby and you have these toys hitting him, it makes matters worse and he's fussier than he was to begin with!"
133744,1,Really like these wipes -- they are durable yet soft -- and you can't beat the price. Recommend them highly.
22866,1,"My son just turned 3 and weighs about 30lbs. I also have a 4 1/2 year old boy that has always been WAY more active and physical than his younger brother. We are a super active family and when we go for walks, older brother can do several miles no problem. My 3yo however, DRAGS his feet and eventually asks to be carried. I wanted a back-pack style carrier for him. We often hike on trails that are not stroller friendly. We are also set to go to Hawaii and will be doing lots of hikes there. We have a framed carrier and I was looking for something that folded flat that will travel well. This fit the bill. Not only is it nice to be frameless for travel, it also has these pros:- Inexpensive!!! Ergo-what???? $120??? You've got to be kidding me! This honestly should be more expensive for as good as it is. But SOOO glad it wasn't! I will probably not use this for more than a year, so I couldn't fathom paying $120 for the ergo. I can't imagine a product being better than this carrier anyway.-Light-weight and super soft material-Love the pockets for stashing phone/wallet/snacks. The main compartment is zippered, so when child is ready to be let down, items won't fall out.-I'm 5'3, my husband is 6ft and fits us both comfortably!-I've taken my son on walks without my husband or another adult. Easy to put on, unassisted. I simply strap it to my waist, he jumps on my back, and I then put the carrier on over him like a back pack.-My son LOVES it - super comfortable for him. I will be sad when he's too big for it ;)Cons:Haven't found any!"
158063,1,"I researched a lot of monitors and ultimately decided on this one due to my fear of SIDS. To be honest, I could not fathom how the sensor, which goes underneath the mattress, would possibly be sensitive enough to detect my daughter's breathing. After all, little babies don't move that much when they breathe! But to my great delight, somehow, some way, this monitor is able to detect the subtle breathing of my newborn. I even tested it out by putting a heavy, six-pound book down on the mattress and the monitor beeped after 20 seconds when it did not detect any movement. But when I put my daughter down and she was sleeping peacefully, the monitor did not beep at all. The sensor really gives me peace of mind when I put her on her tummy because I know if there's a problem, it will beep loudly and I can check on my daughter quickly. And the sound functions of this monitor work great also. The baby's nursery and the den are on opposite sides of our house and still, the monitor picks up every sound from that far away. So if you're a worrywart like me, I strongly recommend this monitor!"
151065,2,"My wife and I think this stuff is definetely NOT a ""must have item"" the nasal aspirator from the hospital works better. We were excited about buying this product and get extremely dissapointed later. This thing is not long enough. I know is shorter and nicer so perhaps the baby is not going to get ""scared"" but does not work so is not worth it. We went back to use the old long one. Do not waste your money."
44517,2,I got this bag 8 months ago when my 3 daughter was born. It is a super cute bag but very stiff. It didn't hold as much as I had hoped. The bag is also starting to come apart where the straps attach to the bag itself. I expected a lot more for the money. All the reviews I read shared such praise about the bag but I would not recommend it nor buy another one. Only 8 months old and I already have to buy a new one. I cost me about $12 a month for this bag. I am not rough on bags in particular either. I just don't think this bags is worth the $100 price tag.....
160613,1,This was the best gift I recieved. Saw it online and read other reviews! The nicest thing about it is that you don't have to pick up your mattress anymore to change a sheet that has been soiled. just unsnap and wash. I got 2 and use them ALWAYS!I use it along with the sheet saver and tie it on for the head for when there is a small spit up. The best invention!
44844,1,"I am a new mommy but my baby is now six weeks old and I love this machine. It is so convenient, quick and easy to use. My friend stopped pumping after a few weeks because she owned a manual Avent manual breastpump and was completely discouraged over how much time it took to pump two ounces. I really can't complain with the Medalla. It has made my life so easy that once I put the bottles in the refrigerator, my mother and law and husband can feed the baby when I am asleep. Since it is my milk I don't feel guilty. Seriously I am absolutely pleased with this pump since it allows me to go out, live life and always have bottles ready. Also, I accidently burnt my bottles and breastshields by over boiling them but thank God that every target and babies r us has the parts for the breastpump which make these easy to find and convenient. If you are seriously considering giving your baby breastmilk I definitely recommend you get one of these. Your baby will thank you later. My baby eats at least 3 oz every two hours but thank God I always have anywhere from 7-12 bottles in the fridge at a time. This is due the convenience and dicipline to pumping with the breastpump. Ladies if you consistently pump you will receive more milk. Please don't give up."
24143,2,What a NIGHTMARE...I was up all night. It just randomly starts beeping in the middle of the night. Not a soft beep but the worse sound you ever heard. Don't get it!!!
11379,2,This monitor is garbage. It's been in use for less than 1 month and one of the monitors lost its sound. I would give it minus 5 stars. I purchased it because of the Fisher price name and reputation. I will no longer consider Fisher-Price products. I think that this product is so bad that Amazon should not be selling it. Since it failed more than 30 days after purchase the customer must absorb the loss.
126976,0,This message is for Michael. I had the same problem when I got these diapers a while back. I ended up by emailing customer service and they sent me the certificate code right away. I hope this helps.
120754,1,"These things took me about 20 minutes to install, and we had to use the (included!!!) extensions. It has worked great to keep my now 2.5 year old (he was 1.5 when we installed) unable to open and walk downstairs or upstairs without a certified adult (or his sister, if she is feeling particularly generous that day). Look great, solid construction. Great product!"
134756,2,"I bought 3 of Springmaid's crib sheets. None of them can fit the crib mattress!!! I went to Target and Walmart, just bought 3 more, and they all fit well!!I agree with the last review, what is wrong?Now I have to use them for other uses."
76473,2,My 3 weeks old baby ends up with her head hanging off the back of this pillow or would slide down with her face in between the 2 positioners. It is dangerous.I found a use for the positioners:I use them while breastfeeding in bed on my side to hold my breast up to my baby's mouth!
64764,1,"So many swings take up sooooo much space in the home. THis was a wonderful addition to our calming repertoire and better still it allowed us to shower, eat, or even go to the beach knowing all the while that our son would be happy and sleeping. If ever we needed him to nap...snap him in and boom...he was asleep. This was also so great because it traveled well for us...to the babysitter, to grandmas and on to the beach during vacation. I got to sunbathe for 3 hours at a time and he slept! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3065,0,"My son got his hands out very quick... The blanket makes some holes when you close it, and h&eacute; got his hands outside... And that is enough to wake him up :(I rate it 3 stars cuz of that... But its cheap, so i Will survive :)"
48038,1,"I researched every booster and every saefty website before I purchased this booster. Everything I looked at was confusing ie...LATCH vs seatbelt etc. My son is 46lbs and about 49 in tall and just turned 5. I wanted a safe seat & I feel the Compass seat provides safety as well as comfort. The seat, however, is very wide. We have a Chevy Tahoe & it fills up the entire seat. It would not be a good seat for a small car. Overall I am happy with the purchase and quality and price. My son loves the Camo..it is very cool."
161451,2,"Terrible tub! We mistakenly used twice and it leaked both times...not from the center where it takes muscles to push it down to snap properly, but leaky on the sides...and then the suction cups stuck it to the counter and water went everywhere!!! I'm going to still try to return it ASAP!"
127481,1,"I purchased this crib for our 2nd daughter (we have a 2 year old already). My husband and I put it together in 90minutes with the interuptions of our 2 year old daughter running away with the hardware. The crib looks wonderful, and the directions were very detailed. My only complaint/suggestion for others, is to get some ""GooGone"" adhesive removal and remove all the warning labels before you put it together, some are hard to get at once the crib is complete. But all in all, we love it, and I even got a good friend of mine to buy the exact same thing for her son!"
7038,1,"This is a very nice diaper, I like the fit better than all the other disposable diaper choices out there. I agree with the other reviewers about the pricing though, it is very erratic. Only yesterday the diapers were 7.49 with 3-5 weeks to ship, and today 10.49 and still 3-5 weeks waiting. Who can order these with such price fluctuations and long waiting?If Amazon could work out this problem they would be an excellent resource for this product."
160580,0,"We registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet because a cousin and a few friends raved about it - they said to get two so that one could be on the crib and one could be in the wash. I received it at my baby shower, but we have found only limited value in this crib sheet for our 11 month old daughter. I am glad we only have one of these!The Ultimate Crib Sheet that we have is the style with elastic straps on each corner, one fully-removable elastic strap in the center of the short end, and two straps on each long end. We have aPali Wendy 4-in-1 Convertible Criband the corner posts are quite thick, to the point where the elastic straps are not long enough to easily go around the corners. Instead on one end of the crib we have to resort to wrapping the straps around the crib slats adjacent to the corner posts and that means there's slightly less than full coverage of the sheet underneath. Since our daughter is a ""perimeter"" sleeper who likes to be up against the edges of her crib, that is a problem.The majority of parents we know have purchased convertible cribs which have thick corner posts when configured as a crib or toddler bed. It would be easy for Summer Infant to make this sheet more adaptable to current crib styles by making the length of the corner straps longer or using multiple snap sockets to make the strap length adjustable. This sheet fits better on a standard/traditional crib with thinner diameter corner posts.I also question the real value of this for older babies who move around in their cribs. We have the crib bumper on now despite not having used it between 1-8 months of age because she is a real mover and likes to stay on the perimeter of her crib to sleep - she was sticking limbs out between crib slats and woke up crying as a result. On the handful of occasions where she's thrown up in her crib (always when she's come down with an upper respiratory bug), she's inevitably hosed the bumper as well. In those cases we have to just strip the whole crib anyways so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is of little real utility for us.I could see this being a big time saver for parents with traditional cribs or those with babies/toddlers who often have various ""accidents"" in their cribs and need to frequently change a crib sheet on the fly. However we have found that a waterproof pad under a normal crib sheet works just fine for our baby."
154756,2,"These wipes are terrible! I usually buy wipes from Target but thought that I'd try these out since they were a comparable price. What a disappointment! The wipes are tiny, the sticker that covers the hole to get the wipes out of the bag is virtually impossible to peel off in any fashion that would allow you to reseal it, they are not very moist and worst of all they smell terrible!!! My 15 month old son makes a 'stinky face' every time I try to get them anywhere near him. I figured I'd just use them to wipe down counters and what not since I can't bear to use them while changing his diaper but the smell is so bad that I just decided to throw them away! I'll go to the big box store and buy their up and up brand from now on."
167642,1,"With three children and lots of diapers changed, I can honestly say these diapers are the best! I have tried every brand from cheapies to not cheapies. These diapers hold everything in, my little guy (7wks) can get a fresh diaper at 8pm and it's super full the next morning but his clothes are dry! I won't buy any other diapers again! Love the amazon price and getting them delivered....can't be beat!!!"
53835,1,"I picked this set for the color, cost and material and overall reviews that it had been given. My two year old toddler refuses to sit in her booster set at dinner and is going through the &#34;I can do it&#34; phase. As such a childs table and chairs became a good idea. I did not want a cheap looking plastic set beside the &#34;adults&#34; table and I liked the idea of having some storage room build into the table. The set was packaged well with no scratches or marks. The color was nice and wood of decent quality for the price. Assembly of the table was relatively straight forward but the screws don't completely &#34;bite&#34; into the wood, leaving the legs only a tad wiggly (but not a danger to my daughter and hardly noticeable). Unfortunately there were no instructions on assembly for the chairs but given that I have constructed other doll furniture for my daughter it was not hard to figure out how to build the chairs and did not take a long time. I did need my husband to help with final tightening of screws and the end product was loved but my toddler who immediately decided she was going to have dinner on her new furniture. Overall great product except for the small issues I had as mentioned above and I would recommend it to others with independent 2 year olds."
15516,0,"I purchased two of these to make a large playpen, and it looks great, is sturdy and having gates is great. However, the space between the metal bars is too wide. My 9 month old reaches his arms out all of the time and I can just imagine that when he starts standing he may fall down and break his arm in between the bars. Another issue is that the gates are metal (which helps to make it sturdy) and my son fell down and hit his head on the bottom bar (his first bruise). I think the company could have padded the metal on the bottom a lot better. So, playpen time is monitored...at least the larger size of the pen allows an adult to sit in it comfortably.One more thing...I found some great mats to put in the playpen.They are called Softtiles and they don't have a strange scent, are cute and are high quality.[...]"
164319,1,"We started out with Pampers Swaddlers from the hospital and I still like those best, hence the 4 stars. However, these fit great, keep him nice and dry, and we have yet to have a leak!"
46169,0,"My baby enjoys look at it. that is the best part.the bad points are1 she only like to watch it when it moves, so we have to stay beside her to move it constantly.2 it comes with two group of cards with differnt figures. However it is very hard to change the sides (each card has a figure at either side) and i don't understand how baby can see those vertical ones."
35418,0,"I bought this because the idea was cute. In reality, this is a heavy pacifier and of little to no practical use. Want to take a few cute photos? This is a funny prop. Want to provide a pacifier that does its job, there are better choices."
130887,0,"My baby loves this swing, but i can't use the swing function because even on the lowest setting it goes way too fast. She only weighs 5 kilos but we tried it with an 8 kilo baby (which is almost the limit for this swing) and it still goes too fast on the lowest setting. Anyway, i agree with everything the other reviewer said in his pros and cons. The motor is loud, but the fish hypnotise the baby and she loves the lights changing color. It's very nice to have the variety of sound options (music, ocean waves, rain, etc). Also it is important that it is a ""cradle"" swing in the sense that a newborn baby can sit in a reclined position."
65803,0,"the stroller is lightweight but the material feels cheap and cushioning is too thin. the japanese combi is way much better in terms of cushion, material quality and design. the carrier is a bit heavy to my liking. overall a 3 star from me."
68309,1,"This is a wonderful children's potty! It is well-made--beautifully hand-crafted. The potty insert is easy to slide in and out for cleaning. There is an insert to hold a roll of toilet paper and a book holder for favorite stories and wipes. It is so convenient to have a place for everything we need within reach!I had bought a cheaper, plastic potty which we tried first. It didn't have handles or a place to put stories, etc. It was very hard for our daughter to use because it had no handles. Also, because she was smaller we had to hold her steady on it. This wooden potty is just right in every way!We ordered a second potty for downstairs too. I highly recommend it!"
77611,1,Great mattress. Nice and comfy. Always a little hard to get sheets onto though.
80144,1,Transaction went smoothly. I recieved this car seat just days after I made my payment. It was in great condition and I would recommend this company to anyone who is wanting a car seat.
49637,1,I bought 2 superyards and 1 extension kit. THey are easy to use and you can break them down into sections of 2 to block items of furniture if you want. I bend mine in an l shape and block things like chairs and end tables.
18027,1,"This has been my son's favorite toy since he was 2 weeks old. He loves to lay on his back and watch the musical star. He smiles and babbles to the star as the music and lights play. He kicks the toys hanging down, loves looking in the mirror and has just started batting his hands at the other toys. At 2 months old now, he'll play for 20 minutes by himself having a wonderful time. I highly recommend it!"
146883,1,"Looks great, pieces fit well(on hardwood floor), no obnoxious smell! I wasn't looking for something perfect, just a mat that would protect my baby from the hard floor. Just order it, you'll be glad you did!"
112439,2,"These diapers are supposed to be for moving babies and in that respect they are pretty good. However, they do not withstand much liquid in them before they start filtering through."
107676,1,"I used this pump when I had problems breastfeeding (which gave my baby the food/nutrition he needed). However, later I needed to pump regularly, and I had to switch to an electric pump. It's not realistic to use this if you are strictly pumping, but it works great and is very comfortable when I needed it for a couple times a day. It's also great to draw out inverted nipples if this is a problem for you"
134205,1,"We are a baby wipe using family...they are great for a ton of uses other than baby...and we knew just how cold they can be sometimes. That in mind we decided that a wipe warmer was the least we could do for our little girl. I had been looking around and doing some research when my mom bought us this one. I have to admit that she did really well for it to be an impulse buy. The pop up feature is great and thus far has worked without fail when filled with various brands. The wipes stay moist and we have yet to find any brown edges. We love it and hope that our little girl will too! Also, in response to people not being able to find the replacement pads, our Babies R' US store just started stocking them. The manager said that it was a new store item carried national, which means that most stores should carry them soon."
25110,1,"THE PRIMARY REASON I REGISTERED FOR THIS GATE IS TO KEEP MY DOGS OUT OF THE NURSERY. I HAVE NOT HAD THE BABY YET, BUT I KNOW IT WILL BE SAFER FOR ME TO USE THIS GATE INSTEAD OF STEPPING OVER THE WOODEN PRESSURE MOUNTED GATES THAT I HAVE BEEN USING. I WISH AS A DOG OWNER, THAT I HAD PURCHASED THIS GATE EVEN BEFORE I WAS PREGNANT. I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO PET OWNERS AS WELL AS PARENTS!"
139614,1,"I got this twilight turtle for my 3 year old son, and he loves it. Every night when he goes to bed he wants to take it with him to see the stars. I really love the quality this toys has, and the stars shine all over the room. Some of my family that has seen this love this toy. I don't think you can go wrong by getting this. I also found that amazon has the best price for this turtle.Also I know this toy has been updated, but the reviews said to stick to the old one so that's why I got the old one, and not the updated Twilight Turtle"
9372,1,"I bought this potty chair for my 20 month old daughter. She loves to sit on it but for some reason she likes to sit on it without the bowl. She is short for her age so when she sits on it the splash guard gets in the way. So I put the bowl underneath the potty and it works great for us. Overall this is a great potty. No distractions, portable, and seems to be comfortable to sit on. I would recommend this potty to anyone looking for something to train their child. Good Luck to all the moms and dads!"
137047,1,I thought I was getting 2 blue gingham sheets. If you look at the smaller description its a 2 pack containing 1 blue gingham sheet and one plain white fitted sheet. Still nice.
122499,1,I got it when it was promised without any issues. Gave to my god-daughter as a gift and she loves them.
162719,2,"I registered for this and received it as a shower gift. Foolishly I did not look for reviews of the product beforehand. I really give this no stars. As many others have pointed out, it is too small for normal sized shopping carts (Target, grocery store carts) and is a pain to put on, but that really is the least of its problems. It is designed so that you cannot use the belts on the shopping cart to secure your child. The only thing ""securing"" your child in the cart are the flimsy ties that hold the cover on the cart. I cut slits in the back so that I could belt my child in, but I hate this thing so much that even with this improvement, I don't use it."
100842,1,These are the only diapers my kids will use. Huggies were too stiff and the other brands just don't hold enough pee for my heart kiddo when he has his diuretics.
166127,1,I love Pampers. It took me a while with my twins (who are now 7) to figure out what diapers worked best for us. Pampers never let us down :) So with my son we have always used Pampers.
79006,1,"This product was easy to assemble and keeps my Dr. Brown's bottles organized and neat. The only thing I did not like about it is that the mouths of the bottles do not fit tightly on the top rack. Therefore, when you move the to rack to access the accessories the bottles wobble and sit cockeyed on the rack. You then have to position them straight up again. No worries, they do not fall off or anything, just shift. Other than that, exactly what I was looking for!"
10725,0,"This item is great for keeping your babies bottle accessories seperate from the household dishes. The only complaint I have is it is too small. It it was bigger and accommodated more items, it would be perfect. I like the set up of the rack and the sturdiness of it, but it is way too small."
73841,1,"The Itzbeen has been with me since my son was born, and I've used it every single day. It's been almost four months now, and I absolutely love it. The timers for feeding and diapering help me to decipher why my baby is upset, and best of all, as it keeps track of how long ""it's been...,"" I am free to worry about the other ten million things that come with being a parent.And I never used the feeding timer until my baby got sick, at which point the Itzbeen became even more indispensable to me. I used it to track how long it had been between taking his medicine, so while I focused on soothing my baby, I had the timer to tell me when it was time for him to take his next dosage.The nightlight has just recently become useful now that my son is learning how to roll over. Those late night feedings can be tricky to do in the dark, especially when you've got a ""squirmer"" on your hands, and the Itzbeen provides just enough light to help accomplish this task.Finally, the Itzbeen is tough! It has fallen out of the baby carrier and stroller a few times, and the other day I accidentally dunked it in a glass of water. I took it apart, let it dry, replaced the batteries (for the first time), and voila- the alarm, the timers, even the lights still work.All this, and it's only been four months. I am sure that as the months progress, I will continue to use the Itzbeen in a variety of ways. It really is a great product, and I highly, highly recommend it."
15662,1,"This is unbelievable. If you're reading this review no need. Just buy it. Well worth the somewhat inflated price. It's absolutely irreplaceable. So versatile. So comfortable. Impeccably made. You won't find a better product. After purchasing, my wife emailed me pics of Ben affkecks baby tom cruises as well as Orlando blooms in this exact carrier. If celebrities that can afford any product out there use this one it's got to be pretty good. We're still using it and my daughter is 16 months. Sleeps in it. My wife jogs, shops and does house work."
49262,1,"Being the mom of active toddler twins, we bought this gate and it was excellent. Far sturdier than a similar product we had purchased previously, and well worth the extra money. This gave us great peace of mind when we were not able to watch the kids at every second. Great product!!!"
21879,0,"This car seat is not very comfortable for your child unless someone is sitting next to them to ensure they don't fall over; even when installed properly. It is however, very convennient for carpooling or traveling because it's so small that it fits in your luggage. the big problem I see here is that I purchased it a few months ago through Amazon for $34.99, shipping included, and now it's $150. That's ridiculous!!!"
90745,1,"they fit my daughter perfectly and i dont have to worry about leaks or anything anymore, before i started using Pampers Baby Dry Diapers my daughter's diaper would always leak esp when she pooped but now with Pampers Baby Dry Diapers they can totally handle anything she dishes out."
57865,1,"We received this as a gift and love it! It warms the wipes nicely. When we use unwarmed wipes my baby gets more upset at changes. Perhaps we are spoiling him. ;-) He is a winter baby so I'm sure he appreicates our efforts to keep his tushy warm.The only time I have had problems with wipes drying out is when I have over filled it and the lid doesn't close tightly or I have accidently left it open. When that happens, I have just added a bit of water and it restores them nicely. I found that the bottom wipe does turn brown but only when I keep adding the fresh wipes to the top and the bottom ones were older. Now I remove the whole remaining stack and add new ones to the bottom. Even if they are slightly brown, it just looks weird. I'm pretty sure the wipes are just fine.I do wish that it came with a pop-up adapter or something. I like the Pamper's pop-up wipes but find it difficult to pull one out because they are inner-folded and stick together. It works better with the Huggies wipes.The only other issue is that the lid collects condensed water and I am afraid of it leaving a puddle on our furniture. So, I place it on a folded face towel and that seems to work.Overall despite the few minor issues mentioned I am very pleased with this product."
59503,2,"i searched high and low for an organizer that would fit on the side of my grand daughter's GRACO pack and play and i thought i had finally found it. it's heavy and bulky which made it not sit straight up against the mesh on the sides of the pack and play, it kept caving in and stuff would fall off of it. i have the Prince Lionheart Wipes Warmer that was supose to fit in the slot on top of this Prince Lionheard Diaper Depot but it DID NOT! everytime i would pull a wipe out it would move the warmer out of the &#34;too tiny&#34; slot and it would fall on the ground. newborn and size one diapers didn't fit in it either because the opening is too big and two and three diapers would come out all at once, the hanging containers on the sides slide out too easily and only a small size bottle of lotion would fit it in (who even buys the small size products anymore ?) the plastic is very thin and cheaply made. it was worth it for me to pay shipping to return it. back to the drawing board!"
154059,2,We have been using these wipes forever and used to love them! Recently the packaging has changed and they now have LESS wipes and they are SO DRY! We used to love these. There is hardly any moisture now. I dont know what has happened to these but I do know that if they dont change soon we are on the hunt for different ones. Such a bummer......
108359,0,"We bought this seat because after getting a folding princess seat for the diaper bag, she no longer wanted to use the Sesame Street potty seat we got 3 kids ago at home. It looked cute, so not a huge expense for a happy kid, right? Well, what they don't tell you is that ""designed for easy cleaning"" means ""some assembly required."" The seat doesn't come snapped together, and while I guess that's not horrible, you have to peel the backings off the cushions for the (flimsy, cheap-seeming) support piece and stick them on yourself. Really? That's just annoying, for the price you're paying for this cheap thing. Also, the foam squishes down when sat upon and takes forever to regain shape. I have suspicions it will be permanently deformed soon.It fits our standard toilet fine, and my daughter loves it. But I'm pretty sure it will go in the trash when she's done with it, not be kept through multiple kids like our other one.Bottom line, if you have a standard toilet and it's the one your kid HAS to have, fine, but be aware of the low quality you're getting for the price."
118836,0,"I got the more expensive of these seats because of the extra safety features. I looked at all the sites I could find to see if they would give me the difference in the material, but found nothing. I got the giraffe print, which my girls loved. However, it's a soft, 'grabby' fabric and both my 4 and 7 year-olds complain that each time they slide back into the seat their pants pull down. It was funny at first (as you can imagine with a 7 year old). Now it's just annoying; I have to go back and pull up my little one's pants each time she gets into the seat on her own.I still want the better safety features but can't figure out if any of the B510s have a different material from the descriptions.In addition, in my car (a Subaru Forester) the backs of these seats are up rather high. It's a great safety feature but I am having trouble seeing in the rear view mirror with them. I wouldn't trade the safety for this, but it's good to keep in mind that the wider, higher head restraints might make it hard to see.I am sending these two back for a less annoying fabric."
8258,1,these are small enough for a newborn would not buy if you have older babies unless you want to use them as a burp rags.
115681,1,"I purchased this stroller as a second stroller for my now 2 year old - for travel mostly and some quick trips to the store. It serves it's purpose nicely. I love that it has the 5 point harness and is not as ""flimsy"" as a lot of other umbrella strollers out there. The canopy is not very big and the ""recline"" is not either - but for a second stroller - it can't be beat for the price. I'm actually looking to get another one for my son too - 7 months."
107463,0,"I wouldn't order this or anything else from target, it takes forever to get here...not sure if it is taking the slow barge or what from minnesota but the expected date of arrival is a range of 2 weeks!!! Would like to review this product too, if only it would get here..."
142201,0,"I(mom) own the ERGO and the Baby Bjorn Active and a sling, and have used a Snugli. The ERGO is by far the best baby carrier out there. All of the others hurt my shoulders/neck after 15-30 minutes. The ERGO is comfortable, and distributes most of the weight to my hips/legs. I've been on many hikes (20+) with Kai(baby) in the ERGO, the longest being 7 miles (almost 4 hours), with no problems. Our first hike was when he was 3 weeks, and we are still hiking with the ERGO at 7 months. He loves it, and falls asleep in it every time we go hiking. The only problem is that you can't have the baby face out. For the first 3 months, that didn't matter- Kai was perfectly happy to face me and snuggle in- I used the head cover for shade and he slept happily... At 4 months, he wanted to see what was going on, but he couldn't hold up his head well enough to sit in the ERGO 'backpack' fashion, so I bought the Baby Bjorn Active. Kai liked it, Lars(dad) liked it, I tolerated it for up to 45 minutes, but just couldn't bear any hike longer than that. Also, Kai's legs hang down in front so that they hit your legs when you walk uphill- irritating to Lars. Kai also can't really sleep in the Baby Bjorn. (I'm sure he would have when he was little and facing inward, but with him facing outward, there isn't a comfortable sleep position for his head.) We use the Baby Bjorn for short trips, like in stores and around the house, and its great for that, but we started using the ERGO as a backpack for long hikes again when Kai turned 6 months. He loves looking around, and when he falls asleep, I just put the head cover on to help hold his head next to me. I haven't figured out how to get him in the ERGO backpack fashion by myself yet, so I have to get help for that.Also noteworthy: the Baby Bjorn has absolutely NO storage- not even a little zipper pocket. The ERGO has enough room for 3 diapers, a small pack of wipes, an extra bib and onesie, my car keys, cell phone and small snack. This makes a big difference for hiking- all I have to carry in my hands is my water bottle(s), and I use a carabiner to clip the bottle to the waistbelt so I am hands-free.We recently bought a Sherpani Rumba and Kai and Lars love that, too. It's a bit heavy for me, but I'm getting used to it. It gives Kai wonderful views, a comfortable seat, and provides LOADS of storage."
31556,1,I Love this one. it is easy to clean and doesn't have all the unreachable nooks and corners that filmy gunk can build up in. I like that it's taller than wide so saves me some counter space. I feel like with all the air moving around my babies bottles and cups and all the little parts are more sanitary. I do wish the drip tin was attached under the spout instead of just setting there but the pros far outweigh that little annoyance.
112342,0,"We love Pamper Cruisers. As a mother of twins, we have had to try to find the best diapers. Pampers may be more expensive, but they don't leak. I would rather pay more for a diaper than have to keep buying cclothes becasue they are destroyed."
36140,1,"Weve tried the Bj&ouml;rn (hurts), the wraps (too complicated), and the Boba carrier (too many straps). I wanted something comfortable I could just slip on and go. Enter the ring sling.I'm really starting to enjoy this sling. My first couple of attempts were an exercise in frustration -- goo was screaming, I was aggravated, and threw the thing across the room thinking I'd have to send it back. After watching a few YouTube videos, though (don't bother with the silly little brochure the sling comes with, it's practically unreadable), I felt more confident, and now we look forward to our evening walks around the neighborhood. Everyone who sees it compliments us on it. I picked out the handle at the end of the tail and hemmed a straight edge so I could use the tail to cover up, and aside from being more functional. I think it's prettier that way. The pictures don't make this obvious, but the fabric is one-sided; this is a single-layer sling. That's okay for us because it's cooler, but it's definitely not reversible, if that matters to you. The rings feel plenty sturdy to me -- no reservations there. I dinged this sling a star for the crappy instructions, the ""handle,"" which made the tail fabric lay all weird and wasn't functional (most of the time you're going to pull the rails separately, anyway), and the overall homemade-ness of the product. But it's still a great sling at a great price. If you're interested in trying a sling and don't want to spend upwards of $55 for one, give this one a go."
25246,1,"I agree that this product is grossly overpriced for what it is. These are just plastic pieces that snap onto the legs of the Co-Sleeper bassinet to raise it higher. But, they do the trick. The directions state that you are not supposed to use these extensions without securing the bassinet to your bed. Otherwise, the bassinet would not be stable at all. But when it is attached to the bed, it is very stable. I had to raise my bassinet 4 inches so I used two of these for each leg. I love the bassinet now that it is at the same level as my bed. I can so easily see and reach my baby at night. I think these should be at least half the price that they are, but I wanted to get the part that actually went with the co-sleeper rather than parts from another manufacturer."
96770,1,Bought the sleep sheep for my 5 month old son. He loves to touch him while in the crib. The sounds are soothing and he falls right to sleep. Definitely worth buying. Also a great gift!
137423,1,"I have two children 15 months apart. It almost like raising twins even though they are not.When we learned the second pregnancy, the immediate question was ""how can one single person carry two babies under 15 months out when your significan other is not available ?"" The availability of this product is an answer to the prayer because this twin stroller CAN hold one infant car seat while another sits as it is, which is perfect answer for our question. The only drawback is, it can not just hold any infant car seat but specifically the Combi Connection infant car seat. My old Tyro can not fit well as we hope.Even with this inperfection, this twin stroller has saved us lots of troubles when taking two children out for clinic visits together, a morning walk in the park, even recent Halloween Trick or Treat trip. The Infant holder ( so I called it )is perfect to hold the infant without a car seat. The stroller also fits perfectly through all the doors without sweat.If you are expecting to have a second child that will be less than 18 months apart, this product is strongly recommended to save you trouble when taking both children out. It may look bulky, but it's light weight compare with others and easy to operate.The price is steep, but you can always find good deal on-line with free shipping and deliver to your house. Unlike car seat, you can wait few days without a stroller before it gets delivered."
12882,2,"not impressed, does not work well, all you hear is static, or you hear your finger holding down the button but not the heart beat!!!!"
135903,1,"I admit, I was extremly skeptical... my mother actually bought these for me b/c my preemie son was in pain all of the time from gas and the only thing that slightly helped was the Playtex Nursers, and he was still in pain a lot of times. We tried everything to help him. Then she brought me these.. and he has not had a problem since... My son is a happy baby again!!!! I am so happy with these. I read on here that cleaning them is a pain.. but that is just not so. I hand clean bottles anyways and it is so simple to clean these bottles, I can't believe that ppl are so lazy as to complain about a couple extra seconds to run a brush in 3 holes. Gimmie a break. I also clean a bunch of parts for my pump, so I just do it all at once. OH!!! And these bottles fit on my Medela pump, so I can just pump right in the bottle!!!! And we havent had any leaks, btw... these things are GREAT. Oh, and they also make a widemouth version that you can get at Babies R Us... just in case you prefer them. I wish I had gotten these earlier.. my son is 7 weeks (he was born at 32 weeks, btw) and he is a different baby with these bottles.OH!! And if you would rather, the bottles and all parts fit in the munchikin dishwasher basket.. even the sraws can be put in the straw things on the side of it!!! just discovered that..."
74095,0,"Stroller is OK, not bad, but not great either.so the good:very nice looking in pictures and live as well, can stroll 2 kids, one sitting, other sitting or standing.the bad:very heavy,wobbly when pushedwheels scrapingthe ugly:I don't know who and how designed this product, but weight distribution is terrible! if only one child sits in front seat, stroller rolls very much into pavement decline/incline direction. i.e. on the road where edges are slightly declined stroller just does not go straight, chooses to roll towards edges instead. due to this it's very hard to push and maintain it not to roll off the sidewalk or not bump to curb (when sidewalk is not available and you stroll on the road). however that is not the case when second child stands or sits...I have not tried other sit'n'go-s so I would highly recommend just to stop by to any local shop try it, see if you like and if it fits your needs; then back to amazon, cause nobody beats their prices 99.9% of the time."
72783,2,"A digital baby monitor seemed like a good idea at the time, but I am ready to go back to my old analog monitor! This monitor makes a loud beeping noise every time we use the microwave, tv remote control, or anything cordless in the house. I'm sending it back this week!"
140242,0,"Sent the item back because it was no better to me than the regular shade. I could be setting it up wrong, but I did not like it."
56151,1,"Works great. We have it at the top of our stairs. A very loud click sound tells you that it is locked. I am very handy with building things around the house, so I had no problems installing it. You will need longer screws.I can see how a novice will have a problem installing depending on how their stairs are set up. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT BUILDING THINGS, DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP. This would be very easy to install in a doorway though. We have had it for over six months. It is sturdy and light weight. We probably open and close it 30 times a day. Our little girl even helps to make sure that it is locked before she goes to bed. I ordered another for the in-laws house when they babysit. MAKE SURE TO INSPECT THE PACKAGE BEFORE ACCEPTING DELIVERY. They ship it in the retail carton and it does not hold up in shipping. I had to return the first one that I ordered. There was barely anything left of the cardboard box when it arrived. The second one was the same, just not as bad."
103905,1,"I bought this pump knowing that Advent bottles were good and that Phillips usually has really good products. I was really empressed with the pump. Some elctric pumps tend to hurt when you use them, this one had the awesome feature of you do it manually before having it pump for you. Regulating your own speed helped for days it was harder or easier to express. I loved that it came with its own case where everything you need to pump and store milk is right there. I would recommend this product to any mother who plans on breastfeeding. Trust me it is a must buy and better then any of the other pumps I have tried!"
42522,1,What can I say it is the best carrier out there. Super easy on your back.
33367,1,I ordered these for my daughter. She had very raw nipples---couldn't stand even fabric on them. She has/had Yeast (Candida) infection and they were so painful she was in tears for days. These shields were a life saver. Others have complained that they don't look great or that they leak and she hasn't had this problem. I guess it depends on why you want them. But if you are in pain and need to air out your nipples and keep moisture and friction away these are great. She couldn't say enough good about them.So I can't even hesitate to recommend them if you are having serious pain issues these are Definitely worth a try.
102673,1,"I got the product in the right time and works very nice, besides my baby loves it. Actually the pictures of the item looks like the original"
160794,1,"This has to be one of the most ingenious baby products to date. My crib does have a solid head and footboard, so you can't snap in the sheets on either end. However, with 3 secure straps on the left and right sides of the sheet, it is very secure. Our son is 5 months old and it has worked out ideally from the time he came home from the hospital. A new mom's must have!"
41347,2,"Initially I was excited to find the ""jumbo"" box of pampers available online - I live in Manhattan and can't easily make it to a Costco/Sam's/BJs/Price Club. However, the price on this item isn't as good of a deal as when they first started offering it. In fact, I get a bettter price ""per diaper"" using our local online grocer. Do the math before you buy!"
60425,1,"I've had this tub since my son was born in October 2001. Yes, it was a bit large in the beginning, but I used the comfy bear sponge insert and all was well. My son in now 19 months and the tub is still great! It is a bit large storage wise. Either leave it in the tub all the time or have some room in your linen closet for it."
134907,2,"We made the mistake of buying this gate for the bottom of our stairs because 1) it caters to wider areas than the standard gates, 2) it appeared sturdy , 3) it looks nice. But its just the most awkward gate ever to open/close. You have to lift the very small lever out & up, then pull the gate out while still holding onto the lever. Impossible while holding a child and still takes multiple tries even without. Even to close it you have to push it twice to click both top & bottom pieces into place. We have a Safety One gate at the top of the stairs which is literally a 1 step handle to open/close. Definitely returning this product, especially considering the price & the fact that i am having to climb over it every time i want to get in/out which defeats the purpose of a gate. Hope this helps."
171837,1,"I love this tub and would definately recommend getting this tub for your new baby! I loved the mesh net. I could lay my infant in it and I could bath with the ease of knowing that she won't slip through my hands. As an older infant, the tub was great for her to sit up and play in. I just love it! I highly recommend this tub over any other one!"
124471,1,"It covers everything (even for my very active son), plus I easily installed it with one hand on the first try. LOVE IT!!!"
165219,1,They keep the stuff where it needs to be if you know what I mean and that is what I was looking for...
22739,1,"Not only is this product so easy to fold, move, pack up, clean, etc, but we got so much use out of the bassinet feature in the early months. Now that we have a toddler, it is a life-saver when I need to set him down to unload groceries, etc. We just get our money's worth out of it again and again."
131362,1,"I would buy this again and again. This is a very good product. It covers the seats extremely well and doesn't slide or move. I love the little holding area it's nice for holding extra bottles, cups and snacks."
132941,0,"This diaper pail worked well for us while our son was on breast milk. Once he began solids, this pail could not contain the smells. And, when you change it it is really bad. The odor is evident to anyone that comes in the house that you have a baby diaper pail. I don't like that I can't seem to find the bags very easily in the local stores. I've had to order online twice and it has been expensive. We will keep the diaper dekor for now but if we have another little one in the near future I will put the diaper genie essentials on my wish list as that appears to be the better rated product. Also, if you get the biodegradable bags it is a pretty evident smell. Sadly those bags don't contain the odors as well."
38238,0,"We love the mobile but you need to constantly wind it up yourself. The song needs to last longer if you must wind it. Otherwise, we needed to cut a small piece of wood for it to fit correctly on the crib due to the way the screw-on plate is made. The bears are cute though."
173810,1,"We have two Papsan Cradle Swings for our twins and they are ""Amazing"". We LOVE these swings or should we say that our daughters LOVE these swings. From the time they came home from the hospital they love to be in this swing. The butterflies swinging above them always bring smiles to their faces as well as the mirror that they can sneek a peek at themselves. The swing will go side to side or front to back which is great to give them some variation. I absolutely do not know what we will do when they are too big for the swings. They take a nap in them every afternoon--all I have to do is put them in their swing, turn it on and see the smiles on their face and then off to dreamland. An added plus is that we have actually taken both of these swings to many of our friends houses and they were easy to pick up, throw in the car and set up again. Out of all the baby items out there this is the one thing that I highly recommend and say that it is definatly worth the money. The only thing that I wish they would do is make it so it would plug into the wall. We have spent our money on the batteries, but it has been worth it. Enjoy----we sure have!!!!"
97513,0,This blanket is beautifully designed but felt a little cheap and wasn't really that soft. I expected it to be bigger also but that's not really anyone's fault but my own.
18886,2,"We purchased this bed five months ago for our then 16 month old. My husband was out of town when it arrived. I put it together by myself in about a half an hour with no difficulty whatsoever. It's very sturdy, all wood, and not too high off the ground. My son has slept in it from day one with no problems."
112330,2,"I continue to use Pamper's Cruisers but definitely not happily. That being said I've tried others and they either are too bulky (Huggies) or also soak through. I have a dd that has been out of diapers for over 3 years and back then they were great. Now they soak through. They leak, not from the sides but staight from the middle of the diaper. They can not be worn wet for more than a short time b/c they will soak right through. I recently found a size 5 left over from over 3 years ago and this problem did not occur. I definitely don't remember having this issue. My dd wore them all the time and even through the night, now I have to use Huggies nighttime or the pajamas and crib sheets would all be wet. Very disappointing but I haven't found anything better."
173170,1,I had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before. Needless to say fabric doesn't protect leather very well. I ended up with deep depressions in the leather. Hopefully the leather will go back (fingers crossed). The firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up. And both of the carseats are as secure as ever. I have the rear and forward facing models.
120796,1,"With our new mischievious puppy stealing everything, we needed gates again! This is an easy to install and use gate. I love that it swings in and out."
35209,1,"Kiddopotamus & Co Swaddleme Adjustable Infant Wrap Microfleece Small, IvoryI sent this to a co-worker's daughter for her newborn; they sent me a picture back of the baby wrapped in it; He looked so cute. My granddaughter who is now 3 yrs. old just loved to be ""swaddled"" and slept best as a newborn when she was, so I give this product 5 stars."
62310,1,"This was purchased from a ""wish"" list for an upcoming baby shower. Mom and Dad live in Vermont and the weather makes this item a must have. This was received within one day of purchase and in plenty of time for the shower. Mom and Dad were very excited to receive this."
142814,2,"I have had such a problem finding the right size breastshields to use with my Medela Pump in Style.. The 24mm size that came with the pump seemed to work, but then I realized my nipples were rubbing against the inside causing pain. I figured I only needed the next size up which is sold in the store luckily. Spent $15- wasted $15. Still too small and now I have been using olive oil inside of the large 27mm flanges to get through pumping sessions. (I exclusively pump, so every 2 hrs I would cringe before turning the pump on.) I decided to get the biggest ones thinking one more size up was still going to be too small..well- these are so large! Pulled in a large part of the areola, which is even more painful than nipple rubbing. I should have known it would be too big of a jump. Why can't Medela show images of actual sizes of flange opening? That would have saved me $30- which I desperately need. Time to write the company.If your nipples are like the size of a quarter or larger when pumping- these are the flanges for you!"
22650,1,"This was a great buy and I am so happy we purchased it. We keep it in the living room for our grandson so we do not have to go upstairs every time he needs changed or I need to do something. It folds up easily and I love the wheels so I can push it instead of carry it when it needs moved. The only recommendation would be that the topper be able to adjust as my grandson was able to pull himself up on the sides way too soon, so we removed it and just use it as a playpen."
54422,0,"We have a three month old who hates to be in her crib. This mobile entrances her and makes her crib time before shut-eye more fun for her (and more bearable for us).However, the motor is noisy when the mobile rotates, and three days after installing it on her crib (and using it sparingly), the batteries were already worn down. My husband calls it a &quot;special occasion&quot; mobile, and we were looking for a more practical, everyday delight our daughter could enjoy. It looks like the only way that will happen is if we stock up heftily on batteries, which are a pain to install (you must remove the entire mobile unit from the crib in order to access the battery cover which must be unscrewed to replace the batteries).A neat mobile, though, and our daughter really reacts to the large-eyed animals and bright, contrasting colors. The music options, from Mozart to Bach to Beethoven, are nice and soothing, but the noisy buzz of the motor sort of cancels out the fluid sounds from our favorite composers. It seems to do the trick, though, because if she isn't sleeping, our daughter is captivated. If she's sleepy, the mobile seems to lull her into a nice, restful repose.Overall, a unique and effective mobile with some logistical glitches."
101721,2,"I was looking so forward to taking advantage of having a monitor in three rooms, but if we use our cordless phone or cell phone the monitor goes crazy. Also at night we have to put the volume all the way up due to all the static that comes through. I am going to Babies R Us tomorrow morning and buying Baby Call by Sony. It is only $49.99 and rated one of the best in Consumer Report. I truly believe this was a waste of $129.99 that could have been spent on somrthing worth while."
7613,1,"I bought this monitor while expecting my second child. I wanted something to be able to hear if my toddler was trying to climb into the crib. This Monitor is so super sensitive, I can hear my toddler moving around in his bed at night. I can hear the covers moving. I haven't had any problems with this monitor yet, and have had it for almost 2 months. I got it on clearence at the store, and the batteries weren't very good, so had to get differant ones. I don't know if this was because it was on clearence, the batteries were just old, or if it's the brand of batteries that came with the monitor. All in all- Very Good Buy!!!"
33310,0,"This does what it says and held our daughter quite securely when we flew with her. However, the strap that runs between a baby's legs is adjustable with velcro. This is a problem if the baby isn't wearing pants as you cannot line up the straps carefully enough to not have some of the hooks exposed. By the time we reached our destination, the hooks had rubbed our baby's legs so raw in one spot that she was bleeding (just a little bit, but bleeding nonetheless). You should also be aware that these harnesses are not approved for use during take-off and landing which rather defeats the purpose if you are using them to travel with an infant that doesn't have its own seat. We just used this when I was nursing our baby since we did have a seat for her (and she still had the bleeding!) and it would have worked really well for this purpose if we had just put her in pants instead of a onesie and leg warmers. It's unfortunate that the velcro rubs so much as the leg warmers made changing her diaper much easier on the plane."
88612,1,Loved this product for my baby. I have enough diapers for her and they work so well controlling her during the night.
154897,0,we live in a drafty house and this just didnt cut it and they grow out of it quickly if you get it get early
93077,1,Its the perfect size for lil ones. It is super light weight and literally takes 5 seconds to put away! I love it. The only thing i added was a little mattress pad for her back and she sleeps like a baby! lol all in all its a wonderful product at a great price :)
9295,1,"This is a great potty. My daughter has no trouble getting on or off of it and the guard isn't a problem for her. The entire bottom of the chair has grippy rubber that keeps it from sliding across the floor. The ""bowl"" has no seams, creases or other scary places were nasties can lurk."
1950,1,This is the perfect diaper. It can hold gallons and gallons and gallons of fluid. These diapers have a great fit and move with the baby/toddler. The material is very soft and much better than any other diaper that I've tried on my children.
97740,1,"My baby and I both love these bottles. I started her on the playtex nurser but got tired of buying the drop ins and the wide nipple made her dribble milk out of her mouth.Since using these bottles she has not spit up once and she is less gassy. I have read that some of the reviewers claim the nipples dont work... there is a trick. The nipples are designed to be sucked at the tip not the base so when she is sucking on the nipple, I gently pull it out of her mouth and she gobbles it down.They are not difficult to clean. I just take them apart and throw them in a dishwasher basket and reassemble."
14167,0,"These bottles are just okay. I registered for them because of all the good things that I heard about them. First of all, they do leak. Making sure they are completely dry does help but does not prevent the problem entirely. Second of all, they are expensive. I have heard just as many good things about other brands of bottles that are a lot less expensive. For my next baby I will not be using these."
116310,1,"We were selling our home with numerous sliding patio doors, and to pass FHA inspection had to have child proof locks on all the patio doors. These were very easy to install and for a terrific price. I did comparison shopping and many cost three times as much and had to be installed by drilling through plastic etc. I would recommend these locks for anyone with small children or selling their home."
41393,1,"I was sad when my little girl outgrew the last size (size 2) available in Swaddlers and purchased both Huggies and Pampers for her. The Huggies leaked out of the inside leg seam every single time, so I tried Pampers - both Baby Dry and the Cruisers. Although neither leaked, the Cruisers seemed much easier for her to move around in and the fit is amazing.You can tell pampers has done their baby-research!! Thank you!"
110744,0,"I read all the reviews on this item and fell in love with the idea of having my baby close to me at night without being in the bed with my husband and I. After having an unexpected C-section, my limited mobility, and discomfort made the arms reach seem impossible. Which it was. The ""original"" version is huge. It took up more than half the length of our bed. Which made getting in the bed at the foot of the bed, and wiggling my way up, after having surgery an impossible mission. Especially since we have a high bed. I was way too sore to move like that. And, trying to get out of the bed was just as difficult. Especially if you were in a hurry.Once I healed from my surgery and attempted to sleep in the bed with the arms reach, I found that it did not come up level with the mattress. This meant that I had to lean over quite a ways to pick-up the baby. And, from a some-what laying position, this is puts quite a strain on the back. It would be easier if I could sit-up, but, since this version is so long, I couldn't even do that (unable to put my legs over the side of the bed).The idea of this item is wonderful. But, it ended up to be more of an inconvience. I will probably use it as a playpen, but at this time, I have taken it down and resorted to using the crib for my 3 month old.I hope this helps."
166565,1,"It lasted my baby longer, cheaper than retail (so far), keeps her dry. I would recommend this over the other Pampers brand or Huggies."
105126,2,"The basic idea may be good but after 4 days I am ready to hurl this piece of junk out a window. Even when it worked ""right"" it was a pain because it is so cheaply made that it is very top-heavy. When you try to swing the lever to drop the diaper you have to stand firmly on the tiny foot braces with both feet, or the whole thing just falls over. That's mainly because the door thing doesn't work smoothly at the best of times, and now 4 days into it the seal ring is coming off and getting in the way making it nearly impossible to work. Add to that the fact that wipes, etc. are getting stuck and coming back out.The only good thing about this product is that unlike most of the others it uses standard garbage bags. I wish it cost twice as much and was twice as well constructed -- if it worked right it would be well worth it -- but as it is it's a waste of money.Especially if you're a new parent with your first child please believe the negative reviews and avoid this thing. The last thing you need with a new baby is to be stressed and angry over a stupid diaper pail."
19064,1,Best investment for a new mom & dad- this sling was made very well - thick material & strongly constructed. My husband & i have both carried our daughter in it- I would put my daughter in it when I did my grocery shopping- sooo. Much better than lugging a heavy infant car seat! My daughter would fall right to sleep when I would put her in this sling- we also used for several months. (one month - eight months old). Worth the money.
93299,2,Its not comfortable to sleep on.Hurts my childrens back.The cot is to short to be called a toddlers bed.
38907,1,"I wasn't sure about this when I first saw it, but it turned out to be my favorite for bath time! I found that it is not only the most comfortable for my baby, but it soaks up the water so baby stays warm. I read one other review that the person says that the baby ""floats"" on the water. It does not float! When I read that before I had tried it, it made me nervous.My one and only complaint is that I wish that it had more padding for the baby's head. There is quite a bit there, but I usually end up putting a rolled up wash cloth there just so his head is up a little higher. He seems to like it more.After the bath is done, I just squeeze out as much water as I can and then hang it to dry.I really believe that it is the best baby bath tub product you could buy...It just hurts to bend over the side of the bath. But, it can also be used in large sinks too (when your baby can't sit up yet on his own)."
33685,1,I can now sleep late without my neighbors dogs giving me a wake-up visit which was always followed by my dog going goofy in response. Easy to latch and easy to swing away. Will also keep my great grandson in a safe area. Great product for the price.
49059,0,It is difficult and tricky to adjust at each connecting end. But then the price is reasonable and definitely child-proved.
13666,1,"These gates are great because they're adjustable for whatever size opening you need to block; they're only 20"" high, so they're easy to step over AND they look great!I needed to prevent my puppies from attempting to climb stairs, but I did not want to scuff up my walls with the typical baby gate, nor did I want some plastic gate to detract from my decor - these gates fit the bill."
131336,0,"I liked this diaper because my daughter is on the smaller side. It actually fits if you're trying to potty train at 18 months. All other companys start at 2T, too big. I wish that the side was velcro like the older age diapers though. The sides rip, not so appealing to me."
147150,1,"I just got this in today in the white pique. I love the ribbon ties, they prevent any scratches on whatever I choose to put this on. It's large enough to hold plenty of diapers."
135860,1,I am using these bottles on my baby who has colic and they work so well and I am also noticing less spit up. They are worth the money.
156831,2,"We purchased this exersaucer for our daughter when she was five months old, and ended up returning it to the store only days later. Most exersaucers offer a variety of different toys that challenge the baby differently. This saucer has lots of toys, but most of them don't seem to have any real educational purpose. The colours are absolutely hideous- very loud purple and red and neon green. Most of the toys are easily interchangeable, but I found that they could be easily pulled out by my five-month old - not very safe!! The tray is poorly designed: lots of dips, and absolutely no space to set anything else down. One of the reasons we bought this saucer was it's portability, but I never did manage to collapse it. All in all, there are much better (read: simpler) saucers on the market. This one is TOO MUCH!!"
88582,2,"The fragrance on this product is egregiously intense. In fact, I tried to air twenty of them out in a closed room and the air in that room over a matter of days would make you light headed and naseus. Don't buy them!"
73204,0,"We have had two of this bottles for about 2 years now. Both are THERMOS brand but they are different designs. One is a Funtainer and came on its own (bought it in-store at Target), the Hello Kitty design. The lid and straw part has held up well, but the bottom part (plastic) shattered during the first week of use (what kind of kid does NOT drop things!) and has been superglued, taped etc many times.The second one is a FooGo and came in rigid plastic wrapping, also bought at Target. This one does not have the issue of the Funtainer with the fragile bottom, but instead, the straw has been split in half for a while now. What is worse is that the straw insert is not made of 2 but 3 pieces, an absolutely bad design because you have to take all the pieces apart to wash and then put them togheter for use again, if you dont take all the pieces apart, you risk having soap in betweek the 2 big pieces or water that will never dry up because is caught in between the 2 tight surfaces.If Thermos could only combine the 2 designs and make one with a good 2 piece-only straw and a more flexible plastic bottom then it would justify to pay $20 for a water bottle. Until then I will keep shopping for something that makes for sense and is durable as well.On the good side, both bottle keep water very cold (I add ice in the morning before school) for several hours and we have not had any leaking issues when the lids are closed. It is easy to close the lids properly compared to other Contigo bottles (bpa free plastic) that I bought at Costco and are a leaking nightmare if not perfectly aligned and closed properly."
114362,1,"We received this booster three years ago as a gift for our first child. We used it for camping trips from the time she was about seven months old and for taking to grandparents' homes. It's lightweight and easy to pack in the back of the car. Trays included are very easy to use and clean. I will say, however, that we haven't really had use for the tray insert. It would've been sufficient to have just the lower blue tray with the cover.When our firstborn was older (getting too big for the highchair, yet too small for a regular chair), this item was very useful as a booster at the kitchen table. We took away the tray and adjusted the ""legs"" so that she could scoot up to the table. Now that our second baby is starting solids, she's going to get a lot of use out of this chair too. Overall, a great item."
81904,0,"I only use the pump once in a while. Sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it doesn't, but overall, it works well. It's just noisy and sometimes uncomfortable. It has adjustable suction power, but if it's not up all the way, you don't get much. It's alright for it's value, but I might have chosen a different one if I had known about a better one."
9430,1,"I ordered two BABYBJORN potty chairs, one for our grandson and one as a gift for another baby. After researching many designs on the web, this product seemed the best."
93755,2,"The pillow looks good until you try it! Too soft, baby practically roll soff. I returned it immediately."
171436,1,This is the best tub! My daughter has used this tub since her first bath. She is now 7 months old and still uses it. It has a great hammock for newborns and transitions easily for infants. The tub also fits perfectly in my sink. It has a section to put the washcloth and soap and even has a plug that turns white if the water is hot. My sister-in-law has even decided to get one. I recommend this tub to everyone!!!!!
159366,1,"This is a very soft and sturdy bouncer, the fabric is soft and the headrest is very nice. I would recommend this to anyone having a little girl!!!!!"
142498,1,"Great fabric choices, modern, fun and colorful. I don't care for a lot of the fabric patterns used for baby items, especially ones that essentially become part of your decor.I was disapointed they used white fabric for the back of the seat reducer . . . it's not too noticable when it is on the highchair but would look better in a color that coordinates with the front fabric. The cushion is nice a thick and provides good padding to protect baby from the hard wood surface. Good quality overall."
48355,2,"We initially purchased this item shortly after my son was born. At the time we lived in a one-story small house (2400sqf) on the outskirts of town. Since we didn't have any neighbors close by and the house was small, the monitor worked flawlessly. Several months ago we moved into a larger two-story house in the middle of a neighborhood, with our bedroom on the ground level and the nursery on the upper.This is where it became spooky. The day we moved in, we were positioning the furniture and monitor in the new nursery. We plugged in the camera, and checked that hand-held to make sure the viewing angle was okay. We then decided to unplug the camera to use a different outlet, and the instant we unplugged it the picture of our child disappeared (obviously) but we were then able to see one of our neighbor's babies lying in their crib. Needless to say, that was a bit disturbing. We switched frequensies, but we couldn't get over the fact that someone else might be able to see our son.Even if the other baby had not shown up on our monitor, we soon found that we couldn't use this monitor in our new house due to the fact of a high amount of interference when we tried to use it in our bedroom. With the layout of the new house (the nursery is on the opposite side of the house and on a differnet floor) the unit just isn't strong enough to cover the distance.On a positive note, while in our old house we had very little interference and the picture was great. If we cranked the volume up, we could easily hear our baby breathing. In the new house, the video of the neighbor's child that first night was crystal clear. Just thinking about it, though, creeps me out...."
112814,1,"These diapers are fantastic! I myself prefer cloth diapers, but because we have a high water table if we do much laundry our septic backs up into our house - yuck! I am also severely chemically sensitive and so the scent on ""normal"" diapers and even the Seventh Generations ones that have gel make me ill. But these are great!! They are made of wood pulp/paper and do feel as if there were cotton in them. They have no chemical scent at all and feel nice and soft and smooth to my fingers. They close by means of an adhesive strip on either side that closes onto a larger piece of thin plastic on either side. If you accidentally close the adhesive strip on the paper it will tear when you pull it back off and usually not reseal. This is not a problem if you use them only once. We potty our baby and so sometimes we take it off and put it back on a few times before it gets wet or dirty. Other than accidentally sticking the strips to the paper I haven't had another problem with using them like this. There is elastic at the legs but it is basically encased so that it isn't in contact with the skin and they are snug enough on my baby's legs.These are a little harder to tell if they are wet than the seventh generation ones (I've never used regular diapers since I can't get near them with their chemical scent) because there isn't a gel. I usually just put a finger on it and then touch that finger to my thumb and then I can tell if I feel dampness or not. If my baby pees a lot though it is easy to tell if it is wet...even from the outside because it will look a little more molded in form, but does not feel damp on the outside and the inside is less damp even then than in a cloth diaper.The packaging says that you should not let the baby put these in his/her mouth since it is paper and can tear off in their mouth and that it should not be held near a flame - again because it is made out of paper. But all that said, these are not flimsy at all, they are well made and hold up just as well as a regular disposable.I highly recommend these for anyone who for whom cloth diapers just isn't possible or for those times when impractical (day care) for those people who want to limit their baby's exposures to chemicals."
94025,1,"Amigos, quiero compartir con ustedes, la belleza de estos stickers, son muy lindos; vienen en un estuche bien pr&aacute;ctico para efectos de delivery; el &uacute;nico detalle es que vienen tan dobladas que al momento de pegarlas en la pared deben hacerlo con mucho cuidado. De resto tanto el material como lo delicado y lo bella de las mismas la hacen un detalle genial para habitaci&oacute;n de las ni&ntilde;as.Friends, let me share with you, the beauty of these stickers, are very nice; come in a box for either practical effects of delivery, the only detail is coming so bent that at the time of paste on the wall should do very carefully. From rest both the hardware and so delicate and beautiful of the same make room for a detail brilliant girls."
41175,2,"Pampers has taken the best, highest quality diaper on the market & made it one of the worst, cheapest diapers on the market. There are many downgrades to the Cruisers that have me very angry:1) They seem to be made of construction paper-they are VERY stiff, cheap & papery (the old cruisers used to be very soft)2) No more mesh liner to wick away moisture! This has proven to cause many diaper rash on many babies (this is from feedback from other parents I know)3) 5 inches of paper in the back of the diaper: no padding, no absorbency-do they really test these things before sending this stuff out? What's going to absorb all the #1's & #2's back there? Paper???4) Absolutley no notice had been given of this deceptive switch. All boxes/packaging is the same as the old cruisersI could go on with other things, but I have things that need to get done-like shop for a new brand of diapers. It's a shame, I really loved Pampers, but this is a disgrace!"
39996,0,I bought this to replace the one I have - my buttons were completely worn out... In fact I ordered two - as to have a spare .. It does work.... but IT DOES NOT work with batteries... YOU MUST plug it in at all times... Very disappointing for what I needed it for!! Will not really say I recommend this to anyone!
180435,1,This is a great product. It was shipped in amount of time promised! I am very happy with my purchase! It is the second we bought. We bought one for a friend and loved it so we bought one too!
35463,1,"I would recommend this to anyone with an infant or toddler that has to sit in dirty shopping carts or restaurant highchairs. This is a great way to protect them from millions of germs and makes sitting in them a little more comfortable. I had never seen anyone with one of these but had to get it when I saw it in the store. Now, everyone comes up to me asking where I bought this and what a great idea it is."
20803,1,"I purchased these instead of a sterilizer because I didn't want another item cluttering up my counterspace. Well, it takes 2 uses to sterilize all of my pump accessories and bottles and you can only use the bags 20 times. I ended up buying a sterilizer anyways for the sake of efficiency (it fits everything at once) but use the bags I have for when we travel. Most hotels have a microwave so I just put these in my pump bag and off we go. Had they made this bag a little bigger to fit all items in a single use, I would have probably kept using these on a daily basis."
32414,2,This gate serves its purpose and stands firm and wont come down but it really isn't made for a busy mom or family. The gate isn't difficult to assemble if you aren't at the maximium width but our entrance way was 48 inched which requires 2 extention kits (142.00 later) the maximum width is 48.5 so tightening the screws is a tricky task you will need separte tools even though it doesn't say so the wrench they give you couldn't tighten anything. This gate was really our only option since we don't want to drill holes and the first steps gate can't be extended this long. Good Luck
13161,1,This is a wonderful new gadget for parents! I have two older kids and didn't have this little beauty when they were babies. I didn't even know there was such a thing...I drive a minivan and my husband drives a SUV and it works perfectly in our cars. This lock helps to secure the car set like no other thing out there. I am very picky about how tightly my kids' seats fit in the car. I try to shake and pry them loose to make sure they are tight enough...there is no movement when you use this baby! This is a definite must have for all new parents!
88045,0,"I PURCHASED THIS WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS 4 MONTHS OLD SO MAYBE I WAITED TOO LATE. SHE HAD NO INTEREST IN LAYING ON IT AT ALL. THE TOYS ARE NOT VERY INTERESTING AND THERE ARE ONLY THREE OF THEM ANYWAY. ONCE SHE COULD SIT UP THE ARCH IS TOO LOW FOR HER TO SIT ON IT AND HAVE ANY FUN. OVERALL, I THINK IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE AN ACTIVE BABY WHO DOES NOT LIKE TO STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG."
78911,1,"We were going to travel across the country and I'm a big believer in having the baby have a separate seat. We tried lugging a big britax seat on a short airplane ride by hand and it was overwhelmingly annoying. All the baby gear is cumbersome (stroller, carry ons, car seat etc). This little tiny strap enabled us to lug a Sunshine Radian 65 (which is narrow enough to roll down the aisle of the 767 on our rollerboard carryon luggage) with the baby in it (1 yr old).It definitely would be fiddly for only one parent if they were juggling child, baggage, car seat, stroller etc. But it really worked well for us. Practice putting it on and off. It is definitely one of the best solutions for taking a convertible car seat on the plane if you need to bring one on your trip. Once our baby is older, we would consider using the CARES harness. But the car seat enabled our baby to sleep in familiar environs.One thing to consider is if you end up taking the baby in the car seat, they may want you to check your stroller in rather than gate check (if you use a stroller bag to protect your stroller). We had no issues in SFO, but we ran into resistance at JFK and ended up checking the stroller in at JFK."
171961,1,"I bought this tub, but rarely used it. As an infant my son was mostly washed while he was lying on the bed and I used a basin of water. By the time he was really ready to be in a tub, we placed him on the teddy bear sponge you place in the bottom of a regular tub, which he enjoyed much better."
20898,0,"We really don't care for these and for the extra price (you get less than the baby dry version), it wasn't worth it. They leaked and fell off quite frequently. The baby dry diapers are great but these, well, for the extra funds (and it really adds up), it just isn't worth it. Get the Baby Dry - they really work and are cheaper in the long run. If you have a larger child, these most likely will not work for you but try both brands to see what works. Huggies seem to work better in toddlers, pampers for newborns and infants."
86638,1,My daughter loves Dora so these are great. Just wish they were a little longer all around since her legs are short they tend to touch the front of the seat and she likes to hold onto the seat and I wish this covered it completely.
74674,0,"I was really excited about getting this walker!! Its pretty and looks like so much fun for my very active little girl. I got it put together in no time at all (and I'm not generally very fast at these things) and was so eager to get my LO in it! I put her in and my husband goes, ""um, she is not even close to the floor."" WHAT?! My girl is almost 5 1/2 months and definitely NOT short. She is average I'd say. A month ago she was 25 inches and a quarter tall. So what is the deal?? So dissapointed! I even put some thick shoes on her and if she reaches her very tippy toes she could reach, but thats it, and I was the one stretching her foot, not her. Sigh. I guess we will just use it for a seat to feed her in, or sit and watch me in the kitchen etc until she is tall enough for it!Other then that its a nice little walker!"
64826,1,I actually bought this travel swing because it cost less than the big ones but it beecame very useful since it was so easy to fold up and take along. I also like that I can easily move it around the house from room to room and it's safe to do so with the baby in it. I have a new baby now so we'll see how long it lasts. I definatley recommend this over a full size version if you can't afford both.
108185,1,"Thank you to the reviewer who offered so many great tips for using this pump. I first started using this when my baby was four days old as she refused one breast. I had great luck in the beginning pumping about an ounce. After almost daily use for two months, I began having problems. I could not get enough suction, and any milk I pumped got sucked back between the 'petal' piece and the pump (which makes for even worse suction.) I ended up with more milk on me and on my clothes than in the bottle.Finally I tried using it without the petal piece and was able to pump 3 oz in just a few minutes. You get such better suction this way. It takes some time to get the hang of it, and I find it works best if you mimic your baby's sucking. Also, releasing the suction on the breast just at the top every now and then lets the milk into the bottle and avoids building up in the pump.You *really* need to make sure that the bottle is attached to the pump properly, as the pumping motion can loosen the bottle. I lost a couple of bottles of precious milk to the carpet when the bottle loosened and fell off! It is not a one-handed operation for me, I hold the bottle with one hand and pump with the other.There are a lot of parts to put together and I have lost a few tiny ones to the garbage disposal. Good thing it comes with extras of some parts. It is not really difficult to clean out, just time comsuming. But this morning I was able to pump 4.5oz from one side, and that outweighs any downsides!!"
48120,1,"We recently went on a 19-day cross country road trip with our 2-1/2-year-old son. I purchased the Bed Bugz bolsters so that he could sleep in a regular hotel bed by himself without worrying that he would fall out. The bolsters stayed in place and were relatively easy to use. There is a bit involved with getting them blown up and deflated, but once you find the right spot, they inflate and deflate quickly.I would like to note that the bolsters I purchased stated that they would work for a bed up to full size. I found that they also worked on queen sized beds just fine.It would be nice if they came with a carry bag to travel with and store them in when not in use."
75641,1,"We got the crib, changing table and then the dresser. When putting this piece (changing table) together, there is a plastic piece that holds the backing(AKA cardboard together)we overlooked this somehow-don't let it be you. The company gives you screws to put the backing on, but I would recommend that you use tac nails since the screws are a lot of work to get in and we had some that went through the wood(I kept thinking I should have known better). We used tac nails when doing the dresser and this worked great! Also in respects to the swinging door on the right of this product(I recommend you take the sticker number off and clean it as we are having to maguyver it now that it is all together. We got this one for a good price and changing pad just fits the top, you will only have a little bit of room on one side of the top, of course this is while you still are changing that diaper."
161161,1,"I received this as a shower gift. I love that it keeps everything in one place and that the items are small enough for use on a newborn, but are still able to be used on a toddler. The only drawback to this is the the nailclippers are a little flimsy, and not as &quot;sharp&quot; as I'd like them to be (especially, when your baby is squirming around, and instead of cutting the nail, you end up bending the nail). The other drawback is that the Safety first emblem on the nail trimmer came off within days of using it..so it's probably better off to take the emblem off, rather then to have it fall off at a later date without your knowledge, and have your baby put it in his/her mouth and risk choking."
63759,2,"My title should speak for itself. My 18 month old has figured out how to remove the tray and does it in the middle of the meal. He can't help but to it all the time. I have 3 other kids and have never had this problem with a high chair before. (My last one needed to be replaced) It isn't too bulky and doesn't take up a ton of room in the kitchen, but I don't like the mess it makes! Terrible design for the tray."
146,0,"After using the Snugglers extra dry, I was a little disappointed in these Pampers. They don't seem to hold the moisture as well."
115396,2,"I bought this potty seat originally when I was potty training my daughter and it was ""ok""...my daughter liked the characters on it, but it wasn't super stable. For the parent, there's a lot of nooks and crannies to clean, so I wasn't crazy about it. But it was functional.Now that I'm potty training my son...it's just AWFUL. First of all, the urine guard is too low so that it makes it worthless. So then, if you try the method where you have your son point his penis down and cross legs (or even just have his legs closer together), the urine guard hurts his legs. My son refuses to use this seat and says it hurts, hence it is now in the garbage."
126,1,"This record book is fantastic. It is orange and green (looks pink & green on the web)and very cute. I liked the items it asked for - cost of various items, birth information, etc. Some babybooks have the most bizarre items they ask you to include. This one is great. I only wish I would have had this one for my first child as well."
73198,1,"Bought this as a gift, and it was so cute and perfectly detailed larger than I expected I almost kept it for my son's picture! However I did gift it like I planned, but do plan on getting one for each of my childrens baby pictures."
57481,1,"I bought this bouncer a few days after we brought my son home from the hospital, because I wanted somewhere else to put him down besides the pack'n play. He's 5 months old now and he's sat in it everyday since we got it. I liked it because it's nesty, and when he was very little it cradled him and he seemed able to snuggle down in the seat. It also has a nice wide base, so although it's springy, it's not going to tip over easily. The fabric is machine washable, and the fuzzy part stays soft even after you wash it. My son doesn't really care about the sounds or vibrations, and after two months he didn't care about the toys either (in fact, we've taken the toy bar off completely), but it gives him another view of the world and he likes to sit and watch the dog walk by.***Update: I am still very happy with this bouncer, however I would like to point out that it does not come apart for storage. Once you put it together it stays that way. If space is an issue for you, this might not be the best choice."
114529,1,"This seat is pretty good for a booster seat. My only real complaint is no harness so it's a little too easy for my wriggling 10 month old to move around. I also don't see it lasting too much longer for her because at the biggest opening its already pretty tight, but she is a big girl for her age (95% for height, 75% for weight). The removable tray is easy to clean though. We got this one for Grandma's house and its great for that. The other one we have is the Safety 1st version [...] and is not as good."
135040,1,I have been using this towel for about 2 months now and it is great. My daughter is about 23lbs and 30in and it still is a good size for her. It is just a little bigger than the newborn style towels and definitely more absorbent. Very soft too!! She looks so cute with the hooded butterfly but she stays warm too! Definitely recommend this product.
165214,1,this product is great. no leaks and since my son is skinny not all diapers work well with him
48313,0,"I spent a fortune on these monitors, but it still won't tell you if your baby stops breathing. You'd have to be right there to see it. I found peace of mind when I purchased an ANGEL CARE MONITOR. It does not have a tv, but it sets off an alarm if it does not sense movement (breathing) for 20 seconds. Now, that is peace of mind!"
156184,1,"This is the third bouncer I have gotten for my daughter, the first two went right back to the store. I had an Eddie Bauer one which did nothing to entertain baby, it just looked pretty and then the Fisher Price Kick and Play which she hated, I think it was too loud and stimulating for her.She seems to enjoy the Magic Moments so much. It has two volume settings and the sounds and voices seem to be soothing to her and the lights are an added plus especially when she is in a playful mood. The three vibration settings are nice and the toys are low enough for her to reach even though she is only a little over two months old. She enjoys watching herself in the mirror and she actually fell asleep and slept long enough for me to clean my house!! I have never been able to leave her in any other bouncer for more then 15 or 20 minutes. I would highly recommend this bouncer over any other out there."
130992,0,"This is a really nice wrap. However I do reach for my biorn active more. I found it fusterating to get used to. It's quite simple, but it's just not very smooth(adjusting it). I can imagine that the none padded version might be better. Still I do use it sometimes and it's a very nice wrap(I have the brown)."
39774,1,"Bought one of these a year and a half ago and still use it for my 3 year old. Baby #2 is here and I'd like one to use for her as well. A sound machine is a great way to drown out other sounds, or even if it's too quiet.This is a great choice with a great price. I like being able to run two sounds - however I always choose rain with the additional thunder. The volume is loud enough for me - I always run it on full volume though.The one downside to me is that I use the same setting every night, but everytime I turn it on I have to rechoose my settings. Multiple sounds - add thunder - tap,tap,tap for full volume. I wish it just remembered. But reading other reviews on other machines, I'm happy with this one and am choosing to buy it once again."
117464,1,"Would recommend this changing pad. I have no problems with it. As I don't to have a changing table I wanted something that I could use on my tiled bathroom vanity, easy to put away but at arms reach. This changing pad does all. As it folds in two I can lean it up against the side of the wall on the vanity or store in underneath in one of the cupboards. I find the safety strap is fine and the Velcro-on side pads does its job even with my wiggly 7 month old.There is nothing poor about this product."
29877,0,"I bought this pump based on the reviews and because of how inexpensive it was. Well, you definitely get what you pay for. I would say it's a good pump for the price. The best thing about it is that it doesn't hurt when you use it and it's easy to use. The worst thing is that it can be extremely time consuming and is difficult to take apart and put back together. The actual pump part some times falls apart during pumping and I've had to take it apart and fix it in order to resume, which can be really annoying. Since I don't pump that often, I don't mind using this but if I did, I would definitely buy a better pump."
160034,1,Great product! Helps babies (and parents :-)) sleep longer and it's very easy to use. We LOVE it!
163254,1,"I LOVE this product. Anything by SkipHop is great. This is so handy. It has a mesh pocket for two diapers, and a zipper pocket and reusable case for wipes and another little pocket to stash an extra onesie in and an awesome fold up changing pad that is waterproof and can be wiped down. It fits easily in the back pocket of my diaper bag and when you need to change your baby you only have to grab this to go to the bathroom instead of carrying the whole bag. Opens and folds up with one hand. I have not had any wear and tear issues and I use this daily."
38935,1,"This is a great bather that does exactly what you need it to do: securley and comfortable hold your baby while you wash her down. The manufacturer recommends that you NOT use oil based products in the bath with this (e.g. Aloe, baby oil, most moisturizers), but as long as you give it a good rinse and let it air dry, mold and dirt should not be a problem.The only thing that you have to look out for is that if you have a standard sink, it won't fit. You need a larger than standard tub in your sink for this bather and your baby to fit into it."
92173,1,This is a huge bank. It's much bigger than I expected. I brought this for my niece. It matches her room perfectly. I love how cute it is.
144507,1,"These are a must have, you're out and about with no trash can around. These smell nice and are easy to stuff into the diaper bag. My pediatrician doesn't allow you to leave diapers in their trash, so I always keep the little baggies with me until I can dump them in the trash."
72941,1,While the cushion is very thin and only held on by three small loops at the top this product still gets 5 stars! It's so compact when folded up. Super handy. I put mine in a small bag and just keep it in the car so we have a high chair whenever we need it. This price was great for this product! My daughter weighs 25lbs and it works for her. At first the chair seemed like it would be so small for her but she fit just fine with tray on as well. She is 18 months. I'd recommend this item to anyone looking for a handy travel high chair at a great price.
78961,1,They work well. It's always nice to have extra nipples for your bottles. They are easy to clean. I recommend them.
76829,0,I breastfeed my baby and this pillow helps bring the baby closer to my breast but it's really way too soft to provide real support for the baby. So I end up still having to hold his head. I prefer my boppy pillow but this one was half the price of the boppy and like I said it does provide some assistance so I keep this one in the livingroom and the boppy in the bedroom so I always have a pillow handy at feeding time.
148335,0,"This potty is overall OK, my 2.5 year old boy likes to sit on it, it is very small, smaller than I expected I guess, he has actually pooped and filled it up."
83900,1,"This one is a little bit smaller then the first one I bought. Yet it has more table sucktions. It is so easy to wipe and clean off. I usually just run it under the sink water and throw it in the dish drain to dry for the next meal. It does dry quick. About once a week I put it in the top tray in the dish washer. It makes meal clean up real easy and the ""catch cup"" that hangs off the table is GREAT! Even food can slide or go past the bib onto legs, clothes ect. The catch up does stop falling food right there."
83362,1,"I filled this album with family pictures - my 13 month old granddaughter adores it. It is one of the first things she pulls out of her toy box when she visits. The crinkly pages in between the pictures also keep her interested. Covered in bright colors and designs, it is very attractive."
180134,1,I tried multiple pumps and this one is my favorite. It is the most comfortable manual pump and very easy to clean. I had issues with other pumps molding but this one never made me trouble. The only better pump is the electric medela pump in style.
123918,1,"Much nicer quality than the other multi-pack receiving blankets I've got: they're a little more expensive so maybe you'd expect that, but I've found that doesn't always mean anything. They came out of the laundry looking the same as they went in with no loss of softness or color. They're still a little skimpy but I've yet to find a lower-priced receiving blanket that isn't. I'm more hopeful that these will stand up better to the wear and tear I'm expecting them to get than the other brands."
138453,1,"this was one of the first things we bought for our baby. It is so cute. The stars are a great nightlight. Only problem is the orange color is a little dull and hard to see, but it may just be his room. I love this turtle, it's a wonderful nightlight."
158539,1,"Love it! When my son was a baby, we used this all the time! It's much better than others I've used. It's nice to know your baby is snug and safe."
84869,1,"This is one sturdy crate. As promised, it's well made and the perfect solution for a nightstand/crate. It was very easy to assemble, though it is possible to put the door inside out and upside down! But that was easy to fix.As for the person whose 9-lb. dog ate through it -- that is quite a feat. I suppose if your dog has reinforced jaws and titanium teeth, this might be possible, but there are cross bars on the the sides if the little piranha can chew through the incredibly tough vinyl. I can't imagine it - perhaps the company came out with a new model after that happened, I don't know. All I know is, I couldn't cut through that stuff with a knife so..."
99288,2,"These diapers are terrible. I have been using the Pampers Cruisers and those work well. I thought I would try the Baby Dry for overnight. Every night my baby wets right through these. I have to change his entire outfit during the night, which really wakes him up and makes it difficult for him to go back to sleep. Sometimes I have to change him twice. I will not be buying these again."
93681,1,"I've only used avent products so far and love them all. Am using the Isis pump, 4 oz and 9 oz bottles with nipples and sealing discs. I love that all of the products work with each other and are interchangeable on the same bottles. I love that I can pump into the bottles, refrigerate or freeze directly and then heat and serve to my baby all without any pouring. It's made everything very convenient for me. I've read some reviews about leaks, but I've never had any of the bottles leak and we've boiled, heated, washed, etc. all of them multiple times now."
81676,2,"This has got to be one of the WORST products I have ever seen! I mean, how difficult is it to make a transmitter and a receiver that communicate reliably??I tried setting the Child unit up within a clear line of sight, no more than 15 FEET AWAY from the PArent unit, and they still couldn't maintain an open channel!! The ""clear moments"" were few and faaaar between, most of the time the STATIC was CONSTANT - even when the volume was on its lowest setting!With the volume on low, we can't hear our daughter crying and have to wait for her to go ""nuclear"" before we can hear it. I can't even use these wasteproducts as bookends or boat anchors, so they GO STRAIGHT IN THE GARBAGE.Don't buy this!"
1562,1,"I really like these diapers and with the subscription price, I think Amazon has the lowest price around."
4208,1,"I LOVE THESE BECAUSE THEY GET SOFTER WITH EACH WASH, WE USE THEM IN THE HOUSE AND IN THE DIAPER BAGS. VERY WATERPROOF, SO FAR NO ACCIDENTS SINCE USINGS THESE! SIZE IS GOOD FOR TRAVEL."
136340,1,"I got this used for half price. If I had bought new, I would have bought the 3 in 1 cause it lasts so much longer! Up to 2 years! However, with that said, I bought this when my son was 4 months (could have used it sooner) and he is still in it at 7 months and LOVES it. I take the detachable toys off and he plays and sucks on them everywhere. I put the flip book (his FAVORITE) on the floor to get him to not cry during tummy time. The only thing I could complain about is that the flipping pages noise can get REALLY annoying but the quiet setting is too quiet and the loud too loud. So I just taped a piece of thick paper over the speaker, leave it on loud, and baby and I are both happy.This has been a life-saver so mommy and daddy have some hands-free time!!!"
76087,1,"Love these so much, I had to order more! They are so easy to use and clean - I feel like a baby food makin' pro."
49850,0,"I love the idea of the lock. BUT it isn't worth it the way it is right now. It needs some more tweaking to be effective. It was broken within a week. Maybe if it wasn't plastic. Maybe a metal, or something used in special force operations, lol. I do have a 3 1/2 yr old boy.Parent Units Fridge Guard, Clear"
108020,1,"I bought this pump when I decided to stay home full-time with my son. I was going to go back to work part-time and buy an expensive Madela, but then we decided I'd stay home, so I bought this pump on recommendation by friends and my doula. Since my son was in NICU for his first week, I rented a hospital grade Madela and it was TORTURE. The cups were uncomfortable and the suction was never right...either too light or too strong. I was intimidated by a hand pump because I was worried about my hand getting sore, but this pump is quite comfortable.As far as the neck cracking goes -- I've experienced this too. This happened to me by twisting the neck on too tight. But if you go to the Avent site, you can order individual parts. Another part I have trouble with are the little tiny white valves...when rinsing parts that thing jumps right out of my hand. I've learned to cover the drain. And those two parts is why I do not give this great pump 5 stars."
5871,1,"If a baby or toddler can pull these babies out, then they are more talented than I.Peace of mind is something I dont have much of these days, but these help."
130820,0,"My son loves this swing. We got it for him when he was two months old and he loved being in it and watching the lights and mobile. The mobile stopped working after only one month. I have continually tried contacting fisher price, but the hold time is to long and when you contact them via their website they never call you back. I regret not buying the insurance on this product. Other than that problem I really liked this swing."
45328,1,"We always give this as a shower gift. With 6 children, we are beginning to know what works and what doesn't. The vibrant colors and lots of loops to hang baby's favorite toys from, this is a hit. This is great for when you absolutely must put the little one down for a few minutes! The mat washes well on cold in the machine and air dry."
36285,0,"I purchased this set because I wanted the dust ruffle to go with my sheets and window valances. I choked as I spent $189, but I figured that since the set included a sheet, a window valance, and a diaper holder, it wasn't a complete waste. I didn't particularly care about the quilt (aka ""wall hanging""), and I had no intention of using the crib bumper.When I went to wash the valances and dust ruffle, the instructions said they should not be ironed. I thought that was silly, since they are 100% cotton, so I ironed them. Nothing bad happened, and they look great in my son's room. As others have noted, the sheet is tight-fitting, but from what I understand, it is supposed to be tight-fitting for safety reasons. I have no problem with that. The crib quilt has a pocket across the top into which one can slide a rod for hanging the quilt on the wall. That is a nice touch. When my son kept getting his legs caught in the crib slats, I broke down and put the crib bumpers in his crib. As others have said, the crib bumpers weren't long enough to go all the way around the perimeter of the inside of the crib. I've been using them anyway.Generally, I like this set, but for the amount of money it cost, I would expect the crib bumper to be long enough to do its job."
14212,1,"I haven't been 100% happy with any of the bottles I've tried, but these have been the best for my baby. You do have to be sure the nipple and ring are completely dry, or they do tend to leak. My baby is most comfortable with the nipples on these,she was choking on the amount of liquid the Dr. Brown's size 1 and Playtex Vent Aire size 2 allowed through. She couldn't get anything out of the Playtex size 1 nipples, the opening is way too small. My husband fed her for 30 minutes and didn't realize she couldn't get a thing out of the bottle! She's almost 3 months now, and I'm sticking with the Avent."
125490,1,Our daughter loved this teether nuk when she was cutting her teeth. I loved that it is high grade silicone and is easily sanitized and cleaned in the dishwasher. It is a great product so I bought two.We are keeping them for the next one. I would recommend this teether.
32255,0,Food mill quality is average at best. Not sure how long it will last but it does mill what ever is put in it. Shipping time was about average and packing was ok.
152501,1,MY SON HAS REALLY ENJOYED THIS BED FOR THE LAST 2 YEARS. GOING FROM THE CRIB TO TODDLER BED WAS AN EASY ADJUSTMENT WITH THE FIRE TRUCK BED.
19453,1,"Es una buena forma de remplazo de las estrellitas circulares antiguas, el remplazo funciona perfectamente en los productos descritos, es una buena opci&oacute;n de compra"
48218,1,Great product that fits the co-sleeper mattress/pad perfectly. I loved the velcro on the sheet to ensure that it stayed in place on the mattress pad and to ensure that the pad stayed in place in the crib/co-sleeper. Highly recommend!
150404,0,"ordered the 4oz wide bottle size...received the 8oz wide bottle size.Rather than get entangled in a time consuming return/reship matter...I cut the straw length to fit. Not a problem here.It worked fine and does what it is supposed to when mama tried it.However, baby didn't seem to get any milk when not tilted...tried several different techniques and approaches ... still no help.don't know if it is an individual baby thing...or ?????Have used it successfully in the past on my children; however design was slightly different and not for a wide mouth bottle.Easy to clean and assemble."
27417,2,I've never left a review before but felt I should on this one. Our now has a big hole in the back after only the 2nd time washed. I've never had this happen with any mattress pad cover before so I was really disappointed.
60730,1,"The only problem I had with the diaper genie, once I read the instructions on how to work it, was that the refills go really fast. If you get it, only use it for really dirty diapers not for the wet ones."
13176,2,"Don't buy this. It's not safe, can cut your seatbelt, and kill your child.You need to get a good install without this dangerous product."
91464,2,"We read all the reviews out there - and this monitor was rated an average rating. I thought that would be enough to meet our needs. In my opinoin, this monitor is so far below average it is unreal.We live in a very rural setting, so you can't blame anything on location. We keep batteries in our monitor at all times, but we also keep them plugged in at all times. The feature with the lights only worked for about 3 months.After about 6 months I would get the worse static NO MATTER WHICH CHANNEL we have them on. We usually keep one receiver in our room, and one downstairs. I have had the downstairs monitor in 3 different rooms (living room, dining room & kitchen) and still I get the worse static or worse yet COMPLETE SILENCE, even when it is plugged in and turned all the way up!We will have to buy a new monitor because I need to be able to hear my son! We have several Fisher Price products and have always been happy with them - shame on Fisher Price for putting such a non-functional piece of equipment out there!"
33827,2,"At first glance, this seems to be a wonderful kit.... or at least one thinks so. It comes in a ""sturdy"" hard plastic case, and seems to carry the most essential products. The products in themselves appear to be top of the line with rubberized handles and even magnifying glasses. It seems to say safety and security. Well our baby has yet to arrive but I had an emergency with a very sick little 4 year old in which I was forced to break out ""the kit"". And man was I sorely disappointed. The thermometer is not lit and hard to read, and to top it off it doesn't even beep when it is done, so you have to sit there and continually watch it. When it says it only takes 90 seconds... it is lying!! I was there holding blasted thing under her arm for 3-4 minutes, every 3-4 hours when she was due for her tylenol or motrin... GRRRRR!!! The other wonder I was initially awed by was the handy medicine dispenser. Two words.... IT SUCKS! It was impossible to get the medicine all the way into the syringe without leaving a significant portion in the cup, and the plunger itself took an act of congress to pull!!! We tried everything, even turning the darned thing upside down. All I know is I am a veteran mom of 3, and I know from experience when you have a cranky, sick toddler, THE LAST thing you want to fidget with is an unreliable medicine dispenser!!! You have enough of a fight just to get the medicine into the child without fighting with the dispenser too!!! In the end the cheap one the drug store sent was WAY better!!! Save your money and time and spend it on something else or even better yet make your own with all the products YOU like most :) And BTW, they are right... all the equipment inside the kit does fall out and all over the place. Really... Safety 1st could have done a MUCH better job!!!"
128610,0,"I am not extremely excited about this purchase, but it does all right. The teddy bear design which is quilted into the pad shows through all of our sheets (cream and off white flannel), which I'm not crazy about, but the baby doesn't seem to care either way.This pad is not the highest quality, but It seems to absorb spit up leaky diapers."
156285,1,Execelent product .This product does what it suppose to do and is very comfortable to use. Keeps you dry and is easy to apply.Once again an execelent product.
31250,0,Good product for the price. Would prefer if it could spin a little smoother and with less effort
121600,1,"I love this stroller! It is not perfect, but in terms of size it is! I love that it folds down so small for my vehicle and isn't a huge stroller to push around. It's comfortable for my daughter, it has a nice basket, the handles are comfortable, it's easy to push, and my infant seat snaps onto it! So many of my mom friends got huge strollers with their carseat and end up really disliking how big it is and buying another stroller later on. They all comment on how mine's the perfect size. :)Cons:* I never could get the cupholder to snap on. It ought to, it's there... I just can't get it to fit!* The basket, while a pretty good size, is really hard to access when the seat is fully reclined (as it has to be when you put your infant seat on it)* The canopy is pretty small.* Folding it down and unfolding it up really does take two hands.Pros:* Price! Very affordable.* Size, just right.* Easy to use.* Comfortable for her and me."
13536,0,"It does the job till my kid realized she could pull it off. I tied it down with ribbon after that and it's fine now. She doesn't even try to bite it, just plays with the ribbon occasionally. Just make sure if you do tie it down with something that its something that can't be eaten or pulled off easily by your kid."
78451,0,"Very high quality and sturdy gate, but my cat learned to jump it. He is 2 years old. So if you think you can buy this to keep your cat out of somewhere, it's not gonna happen."
171480,1,"the best feature is the sling. it holds a newborn perfectly. my baby likes to hang one foot off the side and dip it in the warm water. there is a place that holds shampoo/baby wash. i'll be using this when my baby is a toddler too. another great feature is it has a groove in the back, where you can use it in a sink, or lean it against something to dry. it has a drain too. i don't use that though, because i put the tub on the floor. it's the best tub, and very affordable!"
169930,1,"I love this crib! My son has used it for over 2 years now. It's been converted to the toddler bed now, and he loves being able to dive into bed. He's never fallen out of it either. We have the black one and there are no scratches. We also have the matching changing table and love the drawers. You will too if your kid has a thing for throwing the clean diapers around his room. We put kid locks on the drawers and no longer have the problem. It has held up very well."
119979,1,"My baby was a very large baby and still is weighing in at 16lbs at only 2 months. She is always wanting to sit up straight, but since she's only 2 months she can't do it on her own. She can sit up very straight by herself when she's in this chair.I can put her in it on the floor while I am cooking diner and she'll just sit there and watch me the whole time. I absolutely love it! ! !I just hope she still fits in it as she grows because otherwise I don't know what I'll do!"
106770,1,"I keep this diaper pail in my son's closet. You would never know that there was soiled diapers in the closet. Believe me, there is absolutely no odor at all!!!"
152334,1,"This thing rocks. It holds a dumpster-size amount (slight exaggeration) of stuffed animals. My kids know where to find their favorites because they can see them through the windows, and they can easily pick up all the animals and shove them back in. It's also very comfy (except for giant Elmo's eyes which you don't want in your back) and the kids lay on it to watch tv all the time. If my kids acumulate enough animals again I will be buying another one."
32686,1,I absolutely love this carrier. It is worth every penny I spent on it. It is solid/sturdy and very easy to get on and off and get your child in and out of whether they are facing in or out. I have a daughter 2 years old and a 9 month old and I use if for my 9 month old every time we go somewhere. My 9 month old loves to be in it and is generally well behaved no matter where I am at as long as she is riding in her carrier.
22666,1,This item came in fast! We live in HI so everythings seems get here by snail mail and since everything here is super expensive we knew we had to find something online that was cheaper and no shipping. So when we came across this we were super happy! It was a perfect price with free shipping! I love AMAZON.COM! It was a snap to put together. I'm seven months pregnant and I didn't need my husband help to do it! I love how it has two wheels on the bottom to help with easy manuevering and while it's stationary you know it's not going anywhere. It comes with a traveling case too! Which is super convienent! Since all our family lives back on the mainland. We haven't used it yet since my little booboo isn't here yet but when she does get here it'll be utilized all the time! We have a three story house and her nursery along with the masterbedroom is on the top floor and i'm not walking up two flights of stairs five billion times a day so she'll stay with me on the first floor in her pack n play until bedtime.
139735,2,"The manufacturer's website claims that this is made in the US or Europe. It is not. It is made in China, the box says Made in China and there is a heinous sticker on the back that also ""proudly"" announces its Chinese heritage. The total lack of quality shows at every stage: from unboxing to assembling to using it. The hardware is of especially low quality. The hex bolts are so poorly made that it is impossible to fully insert a hex wrench to tighten them. Not to mention that the included hex wrench does not even fit half of the included bolts. As an additional ""bonus"" mine came with a sheet of paper that says ""instructions on other side"", the other side of the paper is blank. Had I been tasked with making the instructions I would have printed the same ""instructions on other side"" message on both sides.I can only recommend that you do not waste your money on this junk.For the interested here is the quote from the front page of the manufacturer's website:""Safety, innovation and high quality are features of all PRIMO baby products designed and manufactured in Europe or the USA!"""
181874,1,I LOVED this gift! The carry case is an extra bonus and there is plenty of room to store wash clothes and bath toys. A must-have item for your registry!!
169478,1,Great product...I purchased this for my son-in-law so he would have his own daddy diaper bag. The product arrived very quickly and seems to be very good quality. He loved it and my daughter said she will also use it in addition to her Kate Spade diaper bag. Fun for all!!
65870,1,"I bought two of these, one for home and one for the diaper bag. I love them! I hated how when I would make a bottle it would have clumps in it or be really foamy. The mixer does produce foam, I do however mix it in a measuring cup and then pour it into a bottle and am able to not pour in all the foam into the bottle. Plus i have found when preparing the bottles ahead of time, they foam goes away after sitting for awhile. I would go crazy with out this mixer!"
61959,0,"I got these for my almost 3 year old. They are very absorbent, softer, more padded than huggies pull ups. my son is skinny 27lbs so I think I think 3T-4T was too big. They kept slidding down. I read the reviews that said they run small, so I ordered a size up. The problem for him was the butt part, it was narrow almost like a thong and he doesn't have a big butt."
38436,1,"The Leacho Bather is amazing! It is so much better than the plastic tubs that are SO uncomfortable! It dries fast too. I would and have told others about this =) I just wish the hanger did not slide off so easily, but it makes sense that it was made that way in order to be able to wash if needed. Thanks so much amazon, shipping was also fast =)"
112166,2,The new Cruisers leak all the time. I will be switching brands after using Pampers for almost 2 years.
40551,0,"These diapers fit really well and are absorbent. The downside (besides the price) is the scent. I rather give my little one a quick sniff than undo a diaper to see if its poopy. With these scented diapers, I'd often miss it and he'd sit in a nasty diaper and develop a rash. Some of my sister's kids were allergic to the perfume in the diaper."
100091,1,"truly dry, no leak - very very happy with this one, have tried almost all other Pamers. but this one is the best."
102389,1,I recently purchased this very colorful mobile and my little one enjoys the sights and sounds. Love the fact that the mobile can become a music box when he gets older.
43488,2,"I am very disappointed about this item.1)It is VERY VERY difficult to unfold even with TWO HANDS!2)It is not easy to drive on sturdy places. Front wheels are turning around and heading different directions.3)Once the carseat is snapped in place, it is VERY difficult to get any items in and out of the basket due to the fact that the carseat rests very low on the frame.4)It is not universal. It can only be used with Graco Car seats. So, the car seat selection is very tight. Graco Car seats are the cheapest and low quality car seats in the market.I could not refund this item but if I had a chance, I would. DO NOT BUY!"
110628,1,"I looked around a lot for a product where I could keep my twins close at night. The idea of having 2 seperate bassinets was just not going to work. I didn't want to seperate my twins & wanted the convenience of having them at arm's reach. My twins are 2 months now & so far the co-sleeper has been very convenient. I could just pick them right up & start feeding. If they cry, I don't need to get out of bed to check up on them. I could just pat them while I'm still laying down. The only inconvenience is the size. Of course I need it to be big so I could fit them both. But it takes up about half the size of my Cal King bed. I have to crawl half way down to get out. But other than that, I really like it. It has side compartments to keep receiving blankets & burp cloths handy. I'm glad I purchased it & would recommend it. No one said being a mom is going to be easy."
79939,1,"Excellent product that never leaks, keeps the product cold, and is easy for the child to carry....with one exception, they are about twice as heavy as a traditional plastic sippy cup so younger children my struggle in the beginning. My daughter is 13 months and never had a problem. They also float when full! I purchased both the Thermos and the kleen kanteen....the klean kanteen leaks every time and have returned them to Amazon...(FYI dont even try them). If you are looking bpa-free, this is the route to go. I cannot recommend them enough!!!"
142806,0,"Listen, don't let the &#34;XX Large&#34; intimidate you. If your original ones are hurting you , move up on the size!"
113315,1,"We have used these with all of our children. They love them. The silicone gel ones seem to last a little longer than the rubber ones, but overall they are very handy things to soothe an upset child."
127566,2,"I got the crib and the hardware was missing. I had to wrap all the pieces again, pay for a box to ship it box. Got the replacement crib 2 days later and hardware is missing again. This time i went to home depot and pay extra for buying screws. Huge hassle and waste of time!!!"
90439,2,"I am a longtime Amazon buyer and a first time reviewer. I am also a Pampers Swaddlers devotee and so I thought, a fan of Pampers in general. I have since found that all Pampers are not created equal. I typically use Pampers Swaddlers in the day and Huggies Overnights at night for my 8 month old son - who is not by any means a ""super soaker"". I bought the Pampers Baby Dry because they had a good deal going, so I thought I would give them a try. With ""12 hours of overnight protection"", what's not to like? The first night I used these, I found my son's entire frontside wet in the morning. Okay, so it's hard to find a really good overnight disposable. Maybe I should have bought one size up from his usual. I thought, ""I'll just use them during the day..."". Well, after just 1 nap and about 3 hours in the diaper, again soaked. What a waste!"
77229,1,"I am glad I bought this swing. For many months I looked at all kinds of swings and the feedback they all received, then I finally settled on buying this one. Im glad I did, my son loves it and it really helped when he was fighting sleep, he couldn't help but to give in to the swinging and the music. Even when he was just fussy I would try the swing to see if it would help and it did very often. He loves watching himself in the mirror and watching the little bugs twirl around and go in circles around the mirror. The only con I have noticed is that the legs have to be in the perfect position to get the best swing motion, but really that was just adjusting the stand here and there and then it would swing perfectly. Like any parent I like to see my child happy, and to me the swing is worth every cent, and that is important too."
87688,2,"The walker has a few flaws. First of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal. It is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child's head. My son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker.....constantly. The seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high, it should be roomier and drop lower."
15520,0,"The door works well, the gate was easy to install, but it should not be marketed for drywall in Any way. It comes with anchors that are too flimsy, so I bought the best anchors on the market. It took my 11 month old, who is not even walking yet, one week to rip it out of the wall.Unless you have a stud to screw this into, do not buy this product."
76733,1,These little peepee teepees works great! My nephew is no longer sprinkling or drenching his parents after every diaper change! The new parents LOVE these little things
80758,1,"Great product and good value on Amazon. These are great trainers for girls who are in the potty training phase of life. No leaks, no explosions, and they don't cause rashes. Great product overall."
107298,1,"This is a good product. It allows for quick and easy disposal of diapers, wipes, etc. and does not require any special bags. Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any problems with it getting stuck. It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!! If you change the bag regularly, you should not have any problem with odor."
96384,1,"We have never had a leak with this cup, but it is hard to thread and a real pain that there are so many pieces to clean.We much perfer Nuby's other straw cups that are a lot simpler, the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N49ML8/ref=s9_simh_gw_p75_d0_i5?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_s=center-2&pf;_rd_r=1HNBH6G05ZMF34XEZF2V&pf;_rd_t=101&pf;_rd_p=470938631&pf;_rd_i=507846"
31796,0,"The backpack looked great when I received it. Nice size, and compartments were very roomy.However, as soon as I tried to close the zipper the teeth woun't grab - I tried to get it to work - but it was a struggle."
101124,1,"We absolutely LOVE these diapers. Perfect for your little one. AND, they hold a ton of liquid. Our little girl fills them up and still remains dry.Thank you to Pampers for creating a wonderful diaper!"
153570,2,The lamp shade is nice and goes great with the rest of the set. Came perfectly packaged!Never have been able to find a base that it fits on... So while it looks nice if you don't have a lamp to go with it what is the point!?
34647,1,"If you like a smaller, wider bottle, then I would suggest getting these. They also have nice indentations on the side for easier holding."
119839,1,"I bought a my brest friend pillow and was surprised when I started nursing at how dirty it can get! Since these slipcovers have to drip dry, I was without my pillow for a full day each time I washed the cover it came with.. now I have an extra one so I can always have my pillow available. My complaints are that it began to unravel around the seams just enough for the strings to get in the way of the zipper the very first time I washed it, and that the slipcovers do not prevent fluids from soaking through into the foam, which seems like it could get really gross.After ordering this, I did discover and order the professional coverMy Brest Friend Professional Pillow, Blue. It just wipes clean and nothing soaks through."
88241,1,"I'm the gramma, not the mom, but my son and his wife use this stroller all the time (both are seasoned runners) and they love it. With the use of the wind/rain screen, they take their baby on the road and into wooded trails in all but the coldest weather. This stroller manages terrain beautifully, pushing easily while keeping the baby comfy and warm. They wouldn't be without it, and I'm happy I gave it to them."
141258,1,My son really loved this thing. He used to sit and play with it until he started cruising. He would push it around quite a bit and really enjoyed all the sounds and lights. This was a good purchase.
162406,0,"This is a very cute idea...however, not all that great for a newborn...I didn't like the aspirator..it didn't work all that well for my baby. And then we ended up buying a different thermometer; the kind that is like a pacifier. The medicine dispenser is good though."
49626,1,Had a litter of puppies & this was perfect not sure how it will do for my granddaughter.
146102,1,"I was trying to decide between a jumper or a exersaucer. My son likes the exersaucer at day care, but I thought he would enjoy a jumper even better. With the rainforest jumperoo, you get both. My son is 3.5 months and loves it. I think it will be even better once he is a little older. It is a little too high for him, but I just put a pillow under his feet and he bounces away. I also put a blanket behind his back to stabilize him a little. He loved it from the first minute I put him in it. It was very easy to put together and seems to be sturdy. It doesn't fold up very well, so don't expect to be able to hide it away in a closet. I actually found it harder to move around when it was folded up. The toys are good. The main toy with the lights and music is great. My son really enjoys the roller wheels and there are two of them. The pop up tiger is worthless right now, but maybe when he gets older he will play with it. It was definitely worth the money!!!"
66697,1,I bought this stroller when I was only a few months pregnant (in blue/green) after many months of research. From what I read if you used or tested a Bob or the like it wouldn't really compare but for half the price it was great. I have found it to be even better than I expected! I started using this stroller when my son was on a few days old with his carrier hooked onto the snack tray. I then started using it with him sitting up when he was only 3 months because the ride is so smooth he still didn't bounce and was happier because he could look around. This was only while walking. I started jogging with him in it at about 4 months and have been using it about 4 times a week ever since. The ride is smooth and he loves it. The seat is somewhat reclined even all the way up but he can just hold himself up and look around. Its perfect for him to fall asleep while we are in the middle of our walk without me having to worry about stopping to recline it. Definitely worth the money! It is a little bulky but I still use it as my full size stroller when we are going to be walking around a lot. Great buy!
100307,2,Some of the diapers in the box had a strange stain on them! Had to throw them out. What a waste. LM for Amazon to provide a refund.
183623,1,I received one of these as a baby gift and loved it so much I came on Amazon to buy another one! I have one attached to the diaper bag and one attached to the stroller (for walks and short outings that don't require the diaper bag). This way I have the paci ready where ever we are.
8891,1,This is nice to have for open living rooms I just wish it would stay a little better on the wall. I feel like every time I open it I'm going to break the wall.
165716,1,I love using baby dry on my five month old.. they never leak and my baby sleep from 8pm and I dont change his paper until 5:30 am. I love that they fit just fine not to big not to small. I love these pampers so much that I usually buy a convenience pack instead of buying them separately on the store. I recommend this brand to any mommas out there. Plus they have gifts to grow~ you enter a code and you earn points and then you could buy stuff for free.
83618,2,"If you are in search of a bedrail you will quickly be dismayed by the limited selection available at the typical chain stores. Toys/Babies R Us carry this one in the store, and where I shopped in RI, it was the only choice. So home it came. And back it will go. I do not wish to fiddle with the loose hinges and cranking sounds that push the mattress down, (creating a slope for my 2 year old to roll down)when I am trying to quietly put my son to sleep. It takes up 6 inches off mattress space and doesn't even have the decency to provide padding. Not to mention the fact, that once you do figure out how to ""fold it down"" the thing protrudes out from the mattress a good 4-6 inches, not only looking ugly, but creating a place for the child's LEG TO GET TRAPPED during daytime use!Ridiculous. product. One Step Ahead has one online, on sale at this writing."
106961,1,"This is one heck of a product. Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear. One hint though, the diapers don't truly disappear; they just go into &quot;any type garbage bag&quot; that you install in the hidden reservoir. I found this out when the handle wouldn't flip anymore. I was perfectly content dumping diapers and flipping to infinity thinking they simply vanished, but my wife said such is not the case...it actually has to be emptied out every so often.Here's the one beef I have with the magical machine though. You see, I'm a performance artist. After young Dali was born, I used his deposited diapers in my show and the crowds have never been so regular or more pleased. I take a ten by ten foot canvas and all of little Dali's creations and fling them against the canvas. The adhesive and random quality of baby poop is simply mind-boggling and nose-numbingly astounding. PooPoo at the MoMA drew raves. Das Poopa Der Dusseldorf elicited screams. But Pooped Paris Pompidou was my personal fave. So along came Diaper Champ in my suddenly successful artistic life, and alas there were no more effervescent pampers to pitch, no fetid huggies to hurl. My work dried up, but the diaper champ kept on champing.It may prove a little difficult to open, but that's not such a bad thing when you get a whiff of what the Champ has been keeping from your thankful olfactories. Overall, the champ has chutzpah and garners my highest recommendation. It certainly changed Dali, Gala's and my life."
141725,0,"I bought this toy in hopes that it'll help my daughter learn how to walk and play with the different stuff on the toy. Well this toy sorta does its job. However the panel on the toy is very weak and it falls off easily. Besides the weakness and the sturdiness of the panel, my daughter does use it and walk with it. So as a walker it does it's job but as a toy it's weak."
134524,2,"I bought this product 6 months ago, I came home from work one day when no one else was home & I found the canopy collapsed inside the Pack n Play. It somehow on its own snapped & broke apart. I kept the product indoors in a cool environment. I do not understand how this could happen. It was great for the 6 months it lasted. But not the best buy for the money if it only lasts 6 months."
119756,0,"I was sent the wrong product 2 times. The drawer that was sent to me was not the one pictured. Amazon was great about returning it but then sent the wrong one again. I kept the 2nd drawer anyways because I was going to paint it white to match our crib. I lightly sanded it, spray painted it white and changed the handles to glass knobs. It turned out great and was the best deal I could find. It is working perfectly for storage. In the image it has wooden knobs and what was sent has pull handles. I had to fill one of the holes with stucko to make it work. For the price I am happy with what I got."
98843,1,"Love these diapers!!!!! Have used these for all 3 of my kids now. We've tried other Pampers diapers & other brands, but we always come back to the baby dries. The other Pampers ones were fine, but at the end of the day, cost was an issue. The Baby Dry diapers do the job great & we rarely have any leakage. My kids have all always seemed comfortable in them & they smell fantastic. They're a great fit, seem comfy (I don't wear them, so how would I really know, but we get no complaints), & they're not as expensive as some of the others, so they're a great value. Thank you Pampers for the best diapers ever!"
67804,1,"This little co-sleeper is worth every penny. You have to order it online, but we had no trouble doing so. It is very nice to be able to put the sleeper anywhere at any time (living room, bedroom, family room, etc...). At night, we put it next to our bed. It is SO nice to have our daughter right next to us during the night. The co-sleeper is perfect for the first few months before your baby moves on into his/her crib. I feel it is much more useful than a bassinet and is made much better than a lot of the plastic bassinets. I would recommend this product to every parent!"
88495,0,"I registered for this thinking it would come in handy. My son was born at the end of April and weighed 8 lbs. 1 oz. By the time I actually felt like using this carrier, he was quite heavy and it was very awkward walking, especially outside with the sun shining on him. I suppose if your thinking about using it in your house, it might be okay. I think I used it twice and my son is now 3 months old and I don't have any desire to use it again."
48070,2,"so far i tried the 4 and 10 oz liners and i was happy with them, but I decided to give this 8 oz liner a chance, it was a huge mistake. first than all, there is no way to keep the milk inside this package, it spills all the time, we have to keep it complete vertical but how I am suppose to feed my baby with a vertical liner??"
58214,1,"My son was born in November and I found that the snowsuit I purchased was just too big and bulky, and it was the smallest size, so I bought a Bundle Me and it is great. All that you have to do is put the baby in the car seat and zip them up and they are good to go. It also works great with the stroller. I would recommend this product to anyone who is going to be having a baby in cold months it will come in handy."
134929,1,"I have always used avent products, with great success. But don't be suprised for the to ""leak"" a little. In most case, kids suck milk past the nospill part and when then don't drink it all, then spills out when they turn over...but I never really found this to be an issue with the spouts themself."
182274,1,"I have boy/girl twins who will be turning 3 years old in a couple of weeks. I thought it was time to seriously potty train and did not want to use potty chairs. I bought the ""cushie tushie"" insert 8 months ago and the kids had no trouble sitting on it, but would never show an interest in using it consistently. I bought the ""Joshua"" potty only to see if the kids would even use it. The very first day, they both went pee on this potty chair! I couldn't believe it! They were excited about this chair since we had been reading the books and watching the video. It was familiar to them so they were willing to use it. We immediately went out and bought the ""Prudence"" chair for my daughter because my son insisted that the ""Joshua"" chair was his. The chairs are exactly the same but have different stickers on the front. The kids know which chair is theirs, and they love going potty. After one week, my kids are potty trained! The only problem I may have is transitioning them to the regular toilet, but now that they are comfortable with ""going to the bathroom"", they put the ""cushie tushie"" on and use it instead sometimes. They LOVE their potty chairs!"
25420,1,"As a first time mom, I make it a point to research all baby products (especially safety-related) and read all the reviews thoroughly. After reading everything, I thought this was the best product for our cabinets and they work wonderfully! We love them! The adhesive works fine, we've had ours installed for several months and no problem, even with the baby yanking on the doors. With other cabinet locks we were looking at, he would be able to get his fingers stuck in between the door, but not with these. They hold fast. My husband installed them in minutes with no problem at all! Super easy to use and once you get in the habit of reaching for the key before you open the door-isn't cumbersome at all. I highly recommend these to all my friends with kids. I started with just the starter kit to make sure they worked and then when bought a whole bunch more to finish the kitchen and do the bathroom cabinets as well."
137911,1,"I bought this toy as a gift for my 3 year old son for christmas, and after playing with it after installing tha batteries i know he will just love it. This thing lights up the whole ceiling. It is really neat. Cant wait to give it to him!"
63406,1,"I'm a grandmother and bought this to have available when my grandkids come to visit. The price was a big factor in the selection, but it turned out that my grandkids have liked it better than the comparable Baby Einstein product I bought for their house that cost a lot more. This exersaucer bounces up and down as the child bounces. My youngest grandson has been especially entertained by that feature."
52606,0,"We have the FP Ocean Wonders full-size swing and LOVE IT! So when my mother wanted to buy a second full-size swing, I talked her into this travel swing instead thinking that it would suffice for her keeping our son for a few hours a day. Well, I wish I hadn't just because it's difficult to get him in and out without hitting his head on the handle. And honestly, by the time you put a baby in it, it's pretty awkward and heavy to carry around very much. Not a bad product, just not what I thought."
25873,0,The Audio Pacifier has some static noise after the first battery replacement. What could this be from? Is it a defect? Thanks
11599,2,This thing takes FOREVER to heat up and left hotspots in the bottle. Youd be better off nuking some water in a deep bowl and warming the bottle in it. Save your money.
173213,1,"I have one of the seat savers and it keeps the seat from getting messes up from having the carsear in it all the time, in my old car we had leather seats and even after taking the seat out after not moving for 5 months there was no wear and tear on the leather, I bought this one because it can go all the way up the back of the seat when the seat is forward facing to protect not only the bottom but the back of the seat."
138030,1,"I ordered this lamp for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. I am thrilled with this product. It looks pretty and shows up the stars and the crescent moon beautifully. My teenage daughter saw it and wants one, so I am ordering another for her. I wouldn't mind having one for myself :) Sets a realxing atmosphere. Makes a grest gift for all ages. Can't wait for my granddaughter to see it. I think she will be in awe."
6238,1,"We've been using this monitor for 19 months and (knock on wood) haven't had problems with it. I hope that continues. I'm registering for my second unit because I'm expecting another baby and want to use one in his room. I thought about seeing if I could just get another camera, but the extra monitor would be nice to have on another floor.I'm not overly paranoid about my kids' safety, I just love that I can see what's happening in the room without tiptoeing to the door and peeking in. For instance, I know my daughter doesn't need me to come in her room if she's crying and still lying down -- it's when she stands that I know she's serious. Can't tell that from an audio monitor.Your children also provide the best TV entertainment you can watch. They're hilarious in the crib, and that brings a lot of joy to me and my husband."
111632,1,"This works fine, but takes some work and patientce. I would recomend this as a backup, or one for the road since it yields a small quantity."
19818,1,"My nephew is just started to feed on solids, and starting hand/mouth coordination - this product is just perfect. The bowls stay in place on the highchair and dont budge until the adults want them to. Other reviews dont seem to agree - but for a young baby, this is just right. I can imagine as bub gets older, he'll go to war with the bowl and he'll figure out what the tab is for (the tab releases the suction). In my opinion, this product is ideal for kids who havent worked out their arm coordination and just starting been in the highchair.The lids arent overly secure, but are fine for refrigeration."
147741,2,"Just a point of consideration for anyone buying this carseat and intending on using it in a Jeep Cherokee. I installed it and verified that it was installed correctly with the local police department. If you have leather seats, grab the head side of the base - the side furthest away from the latch - you can totally lift it and simulate a FACE-PLANT of your child into the vertical part of the seat. This movement is similar to the rebound that would happen during a crash. I don't know how this product was ever approved as it is a skull-crusher at high impact. I returned it immediately."
162711,2,"I bought this swing, thinking it wouldn't matter that it was the cheapest one available. I was wrong. As soon as I assembled it and turned it on, it never worked well. It barely swings, doesn't switch speeds consistently and then when I put my baby in it, it essentially doesn't move at all. I'll be returning it tomorrow."
60598,1,"I am so happy I read other reviews and purchased this tub for my four month old daughter. She loves to splash and this is the perfect tub for her. Also, it holds her in place so that I can have a free hand without worrying about her slipping into the water. The only downside would be if you do not plan on bathing in the tub as it would be heavy to move once the water is in the tub."
172600,2,"Get a bath seat instead for infants. It looks like a good idea, but it isn't. The water spray never worked. Once the baby is too big to being laying down on the matt they provide you. There is no way to have him sit up without you holding him, which the baby is to slippery. When that happens get a safety first bath seat that clamps on the side of the tub. It's so much better."
54095,1,"Excellent product. Arrived very quickly, thanks deeply for the fast shipment. Looking forward to other opportunities to purchase from you"
96635,1,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandmother (I got one for my girlfriend too in another pattern). But my grandmother had specifically asked for something to carry her wine in that she takes to holiday dinners. She has always enjoyed wine but she has begun to shake as she has gotten older and has become more apt to fall and drop things. When I saw this wine tote, I thought it was perfect because of the protective material. When it came in, it was PERFECT. She could literally drop it and the wine would be fine (don't try this to test though...). This is also great for tipsy people... not just the elderly. haha. I love this product and so does my grandmother!!! (Its her favorite color too!)"
127768,1,"I wanted to wait until we owned the bed for awhile to review the product. It was easy to put together and creates so much more room in my daughter's bedroom. It beautifully accents the pictures in the bedroom and she loves feeling more independent (typical 17 month old)! She is able to easily get out of the bed in the morning and open her door to let us know she's awake (we have a baby gate in her doorway. Also, it is nice that we are able to reuse her crib sheets until we are ready to convert the bed to a twin. :) I love that it still has railings around the bed to protect her from rolling out of the bed but aren't too high that she would injure herself if she wants to get out."
133421,1,"At the moment these appear to be the only bottles, other than glass, that don't also poison your children with the estrogen-like substances (bisphenol) found in Avent and other plastic bottles. But the design isn't as good as Avent, and they tend to leak unless kept completely upright. It's a fair price to pay, but it's a shame that they didn't deal with the leaking problem as well."
182871,1,"[...]""This car seat is by far the best I've used. I went through several with my older child and never really loved any of them. I LOVE this seat and most important my son does too. We've been using it for several months including a few longer distance trips and he seems very comfortable in it. It was a little confusing to initially figure out coming out of the box but now it is so simple and convienent. I live in New England and it is normally such a hassle to have to adjust the straps everyday based on what my baby is wearing with constant weather changes. With this seat there is a knob on each side of the seat you turn to loosen or tighten the straps. It takes seconds. As he grows and I need to adjust the height of the straps I don't have to take the seat out of the car. I simply undo and lift the fabric backing and slide the straps up. I love that the seat is so well cushioned too. The only thing I don't like about this seat is the cupholder. It's cheap and flimsy. Overall this carseat is by far the best for the money."""
100807,1,These worked great for my twins! super easy to manage with a squirmy infant! We had switched from cloth and tried a few other brands but these worked best.
143340,1,"These are great - I use them for cleaning Dr. Brown's and Born Free nipples, as well as in the smaller areas of my breast pump accessories. Good buy."
63595,1,This item is very solid and nicely built. Classic piece of furniture. I used it as a stand alone piece. It came with two shelves and I used one of the shelves as the bottom of the piece. I installed a closet rod to hang clothes and I use the top as a decorative table for my phone etc. Very nice workmanship.
161703,2,This is the worst tub I've ever used! Every day it leaks more and more. Don't buy this product!
5620,1,"I love this product. It is great, my knees don't hurt when I give the kids a bath anymore. I would reccommend it to anyone."
9775,1,"Excelent, well built product. Very easy cleanup. Our daughter loves it and we would definitely recomend it to others (actualy we already did)."
182431,1,"I'd read online that this was the ultimate fix for dry lips, so I thought I'd give it a try. I've always suffered from peeling lips, and it's just not a cool look to wear. I've tried heaps of balms and ointments but none of them really seemed to make much of a difference. Most of them seem to be protective but not really actually moisturise my lips. Since I've started using the Eucerin Aquaphor ointment, my lips have stopped peeling and are just well.. moisturised! For me this is one of those products you'll stick to for your lifetime."
167009,0,"I got this car seat as a gift from my sister (and I'm grateful for it) but the fabric could be better. It feels like plastic, is not comfortable. Also the canopy does not extend enough to block the sun. It's not attached to the back of the car seat, so every time I extend it, the back side also moves! Its annoying... Looks beautiful, but I was expecting more from GRACO."
86366,1,"I'm a first-time mom of a 2-month-old, and we live in a 3-story house. I LOVE this monitor. My daughter often whimpers or full out cries in her sleep, and this monitor saves me from running up and down the stairs over and over only to see that she's completely asleep and fine. The monitor works great in daylight or in the dark, and has a solid range. I get great reception no matter where I am in the house--an old house with brick walls. It even works if I step outside for a moment to take out the trash, grab the mail, etc. It's also very light and easy to use. We chose not to mount it to the wall since for now she's sleeping in a bassinet in our room. It took me a while (probably a month!) to even be okay with leaving her alone in a room with a monitor, but once I took the plunge I was so grateful to be able to see her constantly if I wanted to. If you can afford it, or convince someone else to buy it as a gift, it is well worth the money."
182235,1,"I introduced this potty to my 6 month old son and he loves sitting on it! It is sturdy, one piece, perfect for ""early"" potty training, and easy to clean. He is now 7 months and pee pees in this potty every morning!"
135923,1,"I purchased this product for my new baby after dealing with too many days/ nights of hiccups, gas and vomiting associated with ""classic"" bottle feeding. I think this product is the absolute best and I reccommend it for anyone who has a baby or are expecting a baby."
90431,1,I used pampers swadlers for my baby girl until she grow out of it. I give pampers dry a try and it's fine. It misses the wet indicator but of course by size 3 you become an experienced mum.
44828,2,"I bought this pump several months before I had my son. I began using it immediately after he was born. In less than 1 year, the rubber plastic vacuum cap developed a hole in it and the pump no longer had adequate suction. I have no idea how this happened, as you must take the pump apart to even see this. Anyway, Medela does not repair this part or offer replacement. It is also no longer under warranty - warranty covers 1yr from date of purchase on this part. Although I had not used it for one year, the date of purchase is what's important. I called Medela and they offer no assistance. This is obviously a product flaw. I am extremely disappointed that I have to purchase a new pump, which is a big expense. I am also currently renting a hospital pump which is also expensive and not a long term solution, especially if we choose to have another child. I'm very hesitant to purchase another medela."
125280,1,"I know every baby is different, and he doesnt take a pacifier all the time, but he doesnt like it. Its different to him and i think it just feels weird in his mouth. Im going to give it 4 stars, because if your child will take it and chew on it, it will massage their gums and help with teething. I would recommend it."
50694,1,I have problem sleeping at night during pregnancy. I can't find the right position to sleep. This pillow helped me a lot. It have to the right support I needed for my back and between my. This will be a good choice if you are looking for a body pillow to help you sleep.
34995,2,"I couldn't believe the recline (or lack thereof) in this seat in the rear-facing position. This seat sits almost straight up, which is terrible for infants that cannot yet hold their bodies steady. Also, there is no head support, even with the flimsy pillow. I tried to put my 4.5 month old in this seat, as he is outgrowing his infant carrier. There is no way that he could ride in this seat comfortably and safely. What a waste!!! I'm just hoping that he can use it when he is able to face forward.Also, this seat is very heavy, cumbersome, and difficult to install."
112623,1,"I really don't understand the complains about the new Pampers' Dry Max technology. My baby has very sensitive skin and theses diapers are gentle enough not to cause her any rash. I'm a stay at home mom and I change my baby's diapers very frequently and always use generous amounts of Desitin Creamy, so no rash for baby Cristina. Another plus, they are light weighted so they fit better under her clothes and look comfortable now that she is starting to crawl."
148446,1,"I bought this toilet when my son was less than 2 when I was tired of all of the typical childrens toilets. The potty was perfect because of how portable it is, my son could have it near at all times. The biggest problem is how small the potty is, even for my son it was somewhat tiny. He outgrew it very within 6 months but I feel that for $10 it was well worth it. It served the purpose I needed for the time."
63594,2,I ordered this bib and was expecting to get the bib in the picture for my son. Instead I got a pink bib that says love all over it (although the picture of the cute bib I thought I ordered was on the packaging).
160156,2,"This seemed like such a great idea that we registered for 2 of them. When Luna actually came along she the blanket didn't work so well. She somehow managed to sneak her arms out every time we tried to use it. Also, it seemed to ride up above her shoulders and get in her face. A plain old recieving blanket worked much better if you know how to wrap your baby properly."
414,1,"These tend to run bigger than the Cruisers so if you're not ready to move up to the next size they help. I've had a few leakage issues though but that wouldn't deter me from giving this five stars. They move well too, when they get wet they don't become overly bulky"
135867,1,"this bottle has made my colicky, fussy, gassy baby less irritated no bubbles forms in the bottle so he is more happier."
29162,1,not high enough to wash hands at sink for a 35 inch child. Otherwise sturdy and good product. also very light
80242,2,"We bought in bulk...BIG MISTAKE. These diapers leaked from day one and our baby was well within the size/weight range. About every other day there is at least one or two bowel movements that this diaper just does not hold in... Baby is soiled up the back, on the legs and sides, never to mind the ruined clothes, etc. We are very disappointed with these and considering they are the most expensive ones out there, it is really displeasing. We have since used Huggies, Luvs and even the Babies R Us/Toys R Us store brand (at $5.99 on sale for a 40 pack compared to the $11 plus for the pampers) with excellent results-- I mean it - no leaks at all with the other diapers. What a shame that these pampers really stink!"
26234,1,"We bought this bag to protect our Evenflo Triumph car seat on our first flight with all the baby equipment. I had seen people check their car seats in garbage bags before, but wanted the car seat to be protected. The car seat fit in easily with plenty of room to spare. We packed my son's clothes for a week in the bag too. The straps are a little awkward, but we were able to get everything checked in OK. The bag still looks brand new after our trip! We had a total of 4 different flights. There will be room to add a booster seat in the same bag when baby #2 comes along. I know we will get a ton of use from this bag in the years to come!"
46142,1,"My baby always smiles and laughs when she looks at this mobile. Even though I don't think it's particularly cool-looking, she does, and that counts!"
79308,1,It is one of the cutest Crib Sets for boys that I have seen in a long time.
119677,2,"I was very excited when I received this product at my baby shower! Once I used it my feelings changed. We get so much static, humming and pulsing that it has to be turned down so that we can sleep. The monitor also starts playing music when the nursery is quiet, waking the baby. I tried to return it to Fisher Price but they would not take it because it technically is not defective. I do like the light show and am looking forward to using it when my daughter is a little older."
144108,2,"I bought this chair for my daughter, now 21 months old. I did so knowing it didn't recline, so she couldn't use it until she was almost 8 months old. Anyway, I am SO disappointed in this seat! I am forever tightening allen screws so that it doesn't fall apart, and at 18 months my daughter decided that she would NOT, under ANY circumstances, sit in the seat unless I took the front guard off and pushed her in to the table. However, now she pushes herself away from the table or leans into whoever is sitting next to her all the time and in doing so tips the seat, which doesn't have a large enough base to prevent the chair from tiopping. She also drags the chair to the table (or away from it) when she's not in it and climbs onto the footrest all the time, which is dangerous as well. Altogether with the cushion I spent about $250 on this chair. When I contacted Svan to let them know about this problem, their response was ""It sounds to me simply that this product may not be right for your child at this particular stage in their development, in this configuration. As you know, every child has their own preferences and mannerisms, so not all products are right for all children at every stage in their development."" Great answer from a company that advertises its product to be suitable for all children up to their teenage years and beyond. Bottom line: DON'T BOTHER!!!"
87347,0,"My husband and I looked at a number of different bottles. We decided on using these mostly because of the dropins, we thought that they would be excellent. However, after attending our breastfeeding class we found out that the liners absorb most of the nutrients and research shows that bottles without the liners are the best. So we will be switching over to ventair."
68633,2,This bottle pod is extremely cheap. The zipper broke off in a matter of two weeks and it really doesn't seem to keep the bottle warm or cold. I would NOT recommend this bottle pod to anyone!
69880,1,"This is my 3rd child, 2nd boy. with my daughter, i could use any diaper with no problems. the boys were alot tougher. I usually used huggies because pamper tend to leak. However, with my last son, i have had nothing but problems with pampers and huggies. huggies are fine for the day but always leaked at night. pampers leaked constantly. We tried white cloud but those leaked as well. But Luvs have only leaked once at night. These are great. No more night time wakeups because my son was wet. And no more leaking on relatives or friends. Great diapers, Great value. Definitely wish i figured these out sooner."
103757,1,I only rated this a 4 because there was a manufacturing defect in one of the connectors. Medela replaced the faulty connector since this was not an issue with the product that the seller should have been held responsible for! They work as expected and are nice to have as an extra set of parts for multiple pumping sessions.
181512,1,Got this gate for my two neurotic chihuahuas. It works wonderfully except that you must make sure that the wooden parts (latch) are on the outside where dogs etc cannot get to them because one of my dogs tried chewing his way out and it caused his gums to bleed a little bit. The problem was fixed as I just reversed the gate so that he didn't have anything to chew on. I would recommend this product.
114763,1,"I already had one of these booster seats but have twin grandsons now. They are fabulous. So many ways to use, with tray, at table. Recommend for anyone. With make up child can sit up in it at a very early age."
58225,1,I received a Bundleme at my babyshower for my little one. Winters in Colorado can be so cold especially in the morning and at night. Bundleme has been an awesome addition to my infant car seat. It works as a sleeping bag that fits directly into the car seat with holes for any kind of car seat straps. With two convenient zippers I am able to get to the baby with out waking her. I don't have to use a coat because she stays plenty warm in her bundleme and so I also don't have to adjust her carseat straps for bulky clothes.I now give Bundleme's to all my friends at their baby showers. Since Bundleme comes in so many colors I am able to give accordingly to style preference and color...none of us match!And I can just throw the bundle me in the wash when it gets dirty or has just been a while. It washes up well and dries fast.
133268,1,"Medela is the best name in lactation support products, but I still encourage any breastfeeding mom to get professional support from a lactation consultant just to be sure she and baby are on the right track."
96527,1,"I got this chair as a gift and I really like that it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb in my kitchen. It is very sturdy and the pad is easy to clean- I throw mine in the wash. I only have one complaint - the removable tray is useless after your child figures out how to stick his or her chubby fingers under it and pry it up and tip everything off the tray. I used to just put the tray in the dishwasher but ever since my son was 10 months we haven't been able to use the tray. Otherwise, I think this is a nice chair and I recommend it."
110560,1,"I'm a new Mom and love this changing pad. It's compact and has a spot for diapers, wipes, and a zip up pocket for personal items. A must for traveling!"
87215,0,I was really excited when I first ordered the bag and then when I got it and used it I wasn't pleased. Bottles and bottled water will come out of the sides because the elasticity of the side pockets aren't as tight as they could be and therefore things fall out. Other than that its a really good overnite bag. I hope this was helpful.
144708,1,"I bought this gate to span a 60"" space. Previously we just had one of the mesh expandables there which was very difficult to step over, in fact a family member was injured when his foot caught the top of the mesh gate and then he fell to the floor very hard. I needed something much more convenient, to keep the pets in the kitchen and family room area and not in the formal dining/living room. This gate fit perfectly and was very easy to put together and install. It is perfect for our space as the wood gate matches the wood in our home so it looks very rich. My 5 year old granddaughter open and go thru the gate with ease, as her playroom is at the back of the house. Definately worth the money!!!!"
184382,1,"We highly recommend this product! We didn't do a family bed, but instead used the sleeper in his crib. The crib seemed so huge for him at first, so we just put the sleeper inside the crib and put our baby in it and it worked wonders! It was great because it prevented him from rolling over, which gave us peace of mind. And it also gave him the safe, secure feeling that he needed to sleep through the night. He snuggled right up against the side of the sleeper and slept for hours!Our baby grew out of it at about 3 months of age, but by that point, he was ""mature"" enough to sleep in his crib and didn't need it anymore. It would be great if the bottom part was detachable. We probably would have used it a little longer, but it served its purpose and we definitely got our money's worth. Highly recommended as a transition from bassinet to crib."
25538,2,"Not a fan of these. They're very rough and give my baby redness, so we're stuck with 175 liners we don't know what to do with. Would have preferred if like other companies they sold them as 100, so I could have decided and saved money. They do the job they're supposed to do but at the cost of hurting my little one's bum, so no go."
173722,1,"At first we debated over spending this much, but now we are so glad we did. It is worth the price! Our infant sits so snugly in the swing, so she sleeps in it easily. She hates being put down, but doesn't mind the swing as much.The music will drive you crazy after awhile, so thank goodness for volume control! There are several levels to turn it up or down to, unlike most noisy toys.This sits nicely in our living room. It's perfect!"
114459,1,"This booster is really, really great. Love that you can adjust the height to fit under any table. Love the removable tray for easier cleaning and sterilization. It's also nice the removable part of the tray comes with a lid. That way you can either store the leftovers, or just cover the messy tray if you're in public and can't clean it right away. It folds up easily and you can use the back strap to carry it. My daughter feels like a big girl in this seat, so of course she loves it. :) Would recommend this to everyone switching from a high-chair to booster. We take this thing with us everywhere!"
92209,2,"I realized when I received this set that it was not BPA free, so I returned it. I gave them 2 stars because I do not like the version that is not BPA free. However, I was able to get a set that was BPA free from another vendor and I would highly recommend these bottles, as long as they are the BPA free version. My breastfeeding son adapted to them at one month of age without any fuss and has not experienced any nipple confusion as a result. I introduced them at 1 month so he could get used to them and then began using them regularly for my expressed breastmilk when I would go to work at my part-time job when he was 2 months old. I can see when he is drinking from the bottle that he is using the same motions that he uses when he nurses and I think that is absolutely wonderful. Also, FYI, he is now 6 months old and has always used the stage 1 slow flow nipples and has never had a problem with that. I think that the slow flow are closer to the rate of flow from the breast so I do not intend to ever switch to a medium flow nipple. These are great bottles for a breastfed baby - if they are BPA free!"
64518,1,"This gate has been perfect for my family! Our large Yorkies (12 and 8 pounds)can put their paws on it but cannot jump over it. Our older cat (14 years) can easily clear it to have access to the entire house. We don't get our foot caught on it and pull it down or fall. The only complaint I have is when I had to take it down for an elderly family member to visit, it did take the paint off the wall. Granted, I have it on a very tight setting to avoid it coming loose if the kids do underestimate it's height. I have two of these, blocking off the carpeted areas, and they look very nice. Unlike the cheapo baby gates I had first tried. It has many adjustable features and has fit an uneven hallway perfectly!"
34321,1,I give Burt's Bees Diaper Cream to all my friend's that have babies. A little goes a long way so it lasts FOREVER. The scent is tame and the texture of it nice and smooth.
172387,1,My Daughter loves sitting in the bath seat. We started using it after she out grew her baby bath tub. She loves to sit in it and play with her toys and splash the water.
14533,0,"Noticing that there are over 201 reviews of this bottle, I had to save everyone some time... The best advice I can give, as a mother of 4, try something. If it works for you, great, but and I sincerely mean BUT, every baby/child is different and what works for one may not work for another. Having read the reviews it is so slearly obvious that some love these bottles, some hate these bottles. It seems pretty even down the middle. The best advice I read in these reviews( and I would wholeheartedly agree with) is to buy only a few of something and try it first before you invest in an entire set. As has been shown, you just don't know until you try it if it is going to work for you. If it works, go buy more, but if it isn't working for you, at least you won't be stuck with a drawer full of bottles you won't ever use. This goes for many baby products, i.e. pacifieers, diapers, etc. Rather then saying,,, these are the BEST, which means, in my opinion, that you have tried all the rest and on several different babies. we'd all be better served in the long run if people would just say...this is what I have tried, this is how it worked and this is how I feel about it. So, in the end...my advice is if you feel you might like to try these bottles, try them, but always remember it may take a few brands to find what works best for you and your baby. Hope this saves you some time! Good luck and happy parenting!"
104343,0,I purchased this gate after reading several reviews on different sites. Several people mentioned that this gate worked well for their cats. I assume that those cats are old and fat or young and small. My cats are two years old and they jumped right over this gate soon after I installed it. I gave a rating of three stars because the gate is of good quality and may be able to serve other purposes... not necessarily for cats.
138945,1,"i saw this item advertised in my parent magazine. i thought the concept of the turtle was great, but figured that i wouldn't be able to see the stars on the ceiling. one of my friends had one for her kids. she showed me how it worked, and i couldn't believe how well i could see the stars on the ceiling. i went home that night, and purchase one for my 22 month old son. my son LOVES this turtle. every night at bed time, he goes into his room and makes sure that his turtle is turned on. i even find him during the day playing with it. he loves the different color of stars that he can see on the ceiling. plus, i love that it has a timer, so it will automatically turn off. i wish i had bought this turtle sooner!!!"
114406,1,"I knew from the beginning, that I did not want a highchair............I always found them to look awkward in a kitchen, and the way they attract food into every corner...just gross. My 19 month old son has been using this booster seat as a highchair since he first began eating cereal at around 5 months. This chair is great and very easy to clean. No where for the food to hide in this one, and no messy padded seat to scrub. Highly recommend this product."
114641,1,"Purchased for my nephew in 2009. The booster seat was easy to carry along with to restaurants during family outings. Used at home, you could change the tray easily by adding the different covers to the main tray. No longer used since my nephew grew out of it, but useful when originally purchased."
8068,1,"I came across this because I needed something for my foster son's little bottom. He has Spina Bifida, therefore he is parayalized in his lower portion of his body. His skin stays broken down & therefore he keeps a horrible diaper rash. The Canus Lil Goats Milk 40% zinc oxide seems to be a great barrier between his little bottom & his diaper. I am able to use it on every diaper change for great protection. I buy this product in quantity."
151387,2,"This car seat locking clip is supposed to function like the one that is typically included with your car seat when you buy it. We somehow lost our original clip that came with our Graco Snugride, so I picked this one up at a local store when we were preparing for the birth of our second child. The fit is not quite right so that it is VERY difficult to get the belt straps into it. Much harder than the (very similar looking) Graco belt locking clip. I threw out the ""Super Lock"" and ordered the Graco locking clip online. You can also buy it at Babies R Us stores for a couple dollars.FYI, if your car accommodates L.A.T.C.H. installation, you don't need a belt locking clip at all because you don't use the seat belts. All vehicles manufactured after 2001 have L.A.T.C.H."
150570,2,Doesn't work with travel systems like Evenflo. You need a much longer board. Easy to install but doesn't seem secure.I tried with Gracco stroller and doesn't fit. The stroller bar has to be very thick to have good fit
40411,1,Pampers diapers are very good. Both my son and daughter use this product and we love them. Good absorbance. We never had diaper rash problem. The diapers are high in the waist line and therefore don't cause leakings especially for boys. And cruisers are good for active toddlers. I always buy from Amazon no matter it's a couple of dollars more or less than in the store--it's delivered fast to your door (I sometimes order when I only have one day's supply left and the next day I got it). I give it 5 stars for both the product and the experience of shopping with amazon.com.
48693,2,"I didn't care that the play yard is ugly. I just needed it to be functional. However, while putting it up, one of the corner ""joints"" shattered. It was so frustrating! We ended up sending back the piece of garbage, and we bought a beautiful bronze metal play yard. Sure, this yard is much, much cheaper. However, it didn't save us any money, because it turned out to be so fragile that it was useless for our purpose."
154616,1,They do a great job cleaning and they do not have an offensive smell and after using them on my daughter for her first two weeks of life in the real world she has no issues.
73105,1,"I purchased this for my daughter when she began sitting upright in shopping carriages. I could not stand the thought of her touching anything with all those germs. I previously had a cheaper version made by Infantino that I purchased from another store, but was not at all happy with it. It did not cover the entire surface of the carriage and my daughter always managed to touch the one spot that was not protected. I then purchased the Floppy and could not be happier. Its generous size covers the entire surface of every carriage I have encountered. The plush material also makes for a comfy ride. She is nearly 3 and I still use it all the time. It washes well and folds up compact. Well worth it and a must for every baby registry."
146111,1,"I bought this product about 5 weeks ago an it has worked awesome! My baby absolutely love this thing. All of the fun features on this product makes it easy to keep my baby entertained and saves me a headache! Any product that can do that I have no other choice then to give a FIVE STAR! I have already recommended this to all of my friends. Simple to use, Quality product, My baby loves it=Perfect PRODUCT."
67914,0,"I love this gym for my 2month old. The only downside is that the mat can only be spot cleaned, it doesn't detach from the base to use the washing machine. I don't know how well it will work for when he gets older, but it works great for now. Well worth it for the price. If you are looking for something cheap for just a little bit, this is your best bet! Happy shopping!"
96415,1,"This is a great item. We have 18 month twin boys that figured out how to open the doors and this keeps them from doing that anymore. They cover the lever handles and really work. Only negative is that they are kind of bulky but this is the only peroduct out there that works for these handles, and older kids can operate them easily."
11952,1,"This is one of the best products! I cut up fresh fruit and stick a couple of pieces in and give it to my son (7 mos.) and it would keep him distracted for a while. I would give it to him in his high chair and could get a lot done around the kitchen while he was sucking. I was comfortable with this as I knew I could turn my back and he wouldn't choke! Another thing we do is stick an ice cube in it and he loves it, and it isn't very messy to clean up! I will definitely reccommend this product!!"
16647,1,"I just purchased the Chicco Cortina Travel Sytem after I attempted to purchase a stroller bag cover for my Gracco Quattro Tour Stroller. After purchasing three stroller bags that didn't fit the Quattro I went back to Babies R Us to find a stoller that did. We travel often and I do not want to travel without the stroller protected. The Chicco Cortina Travel System not only fit in several bags it was everything I loved about the Gracco Quattro and more. The colors are timeless and unisex, it has more padding, the base is much smaller (easier to tote along during travel - fits in large suitcase and is much less of a hassle in the car) and has a storage compartment in its base, weighs five pounds less and folds up smaller. The material is also weather protected, the handle height is adjustable, has a five point harness, and the car seat has way more padding, adjustments, and the handle is much easier to click into positions. The only negatives we have found is that it's a tad bit longer when folded and the storage basket doesn't pull out (you have to raise the recline). However, it also can stand when folded which is nice - less bending down. It costs about $80 more than the popular Gracco Quattro and the extra base costs more, but all the cool features and the fact that you can bag it more than make up for it's higher price."
3349,0,"My babies love Avent pacififers, so as a pacifier, I have no complaint. However, I bought this particular model because sometimes, at night, my daughters would toss their pacifiers out of the crip or loose them on the crib and I couldn't find them.Unfortunately, the glow lasts right after they've bee exposed to light, and only lasts for a few seconds. So, I'm a little dissapointed with them.."
1401,2,"This is not what i oredered, but this is the third time they continue to send them to me, dont know why"
53324,1,"We bought this to be more like a bed for our baby because she seemed to have some congestion when we laid her down flat. She slept 6 hours the first night in it at 5 weeks old. It lays better than a bouncy seat and cuddles them in it. I am sure the motion part is great, but for now, we just use it as a bed and love it."
55387,0,"I am a huge fan of Sassy so naturally I didn't hesitate in choosing their car seat undermat. So far - the mat is durable but the 3 mesh storage pockets have detached and unfortunately have become one useless storage pocket. The three &quot;light&quot; items that I stored included wipes, tiny stuffed animal and a small book. Contact was rarely made with these pockets including removing and returning the stored items, so.....either the lack of durability is due to quality or just bad luck. I am in the process of looking for a replacement."
65117,1,"So far, we love it! Directions to install seemed a little complicated but we figured it out."
98461,1,"Great sterilizer, with 2 functions that will allows you to keep your bottles sterilized for a 12 hours period or 24 for, with digital indicator. i recomend this device 100%. great and excelent quality"
77916,0,"We bought this cover to use for our frequent cross-country flights to visit family. After the first trip as checked luggage, the zipper started to malfunction and was difficult to open and close. After the second trip, one side of the zipper was completely useless and a couple of tears appearred near the bottom as other reviewers also noticed.However, I went to the safefit website and contacted customer service using the email address provided. They repsonded quickly and sent a replacement product immediately.This car seat cover would have worked ok if the zipper had not broken - since I haven't seen others complaining about this, I will assume it was an isolated event and hopefully my replacement will be ok. As far as the rips - just be aware that the wheel function is not so useful because the bag will drag on the ground and tears will result. Still not a bad product for the price - at least it keeps your car seat clean when you are checking it as luggage."
149760,1,"I love this booster. It looks so stylish, plus my son sits comfortably in it. I like that the back rest will lay back with the seat in the car."
6634,2,"I have ordered these diapers from amazon before with no problems. I have waited over a month for my most recent order. Needless to say, 24hours is optimistic."
126821,1,"I got the e-mail notification from Amazon informing the deal that if you purchase $99 worth of Huggies product, you will get $30 Amazon coupon toward future purchase. So I hurried and order #4 3 boxes (92.97) and 1 over night (9.99) all at once. Now I am only waiting for the coupon.This kind of deal works for me before. There used to be requirement of purchase only $79 but they increse it to $99. It is still a best deal around. Think about it...- Same quality of diapers (for me at least..the diaper has the same Lion King design as the one I got from BabyRus)- No shipping cost- No tax- No trip to the store and trying to haul the box to the car- $30 free money!!It's almost like buy 3 box get 1 free! What a great deal."
183934,2,These diapers do not have enough flexibility and are too narrow. I also have to buy a size bigger than I would buy with Pampers Cruisers. The absorbency is good but that is the only thing I like- this was my first and last purchase of Luvs.
65855,2,It is way so powerful that it splashes the liquid everywhere..my point of buying this product was to help the formula less bubbling when mixing..but it created more..what a disappointment..
118444,1,"This seat is just what I was looking for. For my first baby I got the whole baby tub with all the colorful gimmicks... which I never used. It was alright, but the kids slumped to the side in it. When I had my second I wanted to bathe them together, but the baby tub was too big to put in the big bath tub and have any room left for the 2 year old. In comes the PRIMO bath seat. It fits perfectly in one end of the tub. My little guy is 25 inches and 15 pounds and it is still quite comfortable. This would also work on the counter for those first sponge baths. Our sink is pretty small, so it wouldn't fit there, but it would in a bigger one."
116917,1,"I love this tub. When I had my fist child I picked it up just because it was on sale but when i got home and began using it, I loved it! So when we had our second child, there was no discussion we just bought this one. It's great for the money, lightweight and convenient for newborn, infants and toddlers. Ever since her little brother was born, my two year old also wants to bathe in it from time to time and amazingly she still can (sort of). Both my kids hit 20 lbs before 6 mos and this tub was up for the challenge. I love this tub!"
84485,1,"We love this product. I was weary after the ""flipped upside down"" review, but I don't understand how that happened. For us, it was easy to install, the ropes were easy to adjust, and it seems very comfortable to my toddler. I bought 2, and one of the ropes on one of the seats is a little twisted so we'll adjust that, but other than that... no problems whatsoever."
137522,1,Pretty nice item we had to purchase to replace a similar product from other manufacturer. This one only turns off and on in 3 different colors and nothing else special.
66242,1,"I'm not sure, why some of the reviews are less then 5 stars. I have a 4 & 1/2 month old, and I've been using Dr. Browns Bottles for the last 2 months. There is no greater thing. I disagree about cleaning, because it takes only few minutes longer then any other ones, but why would any one even worry about cleaning, knowing that your baby is happy. To the question if it reduces gas, the answer is yes. My baby was breast fed, the first few days, but before we left the hospital he was taken off breast milk for 24 hours, and never went back on it. All formulas were giving him extremely bad gas and that caused colic. Even his Pediatrician didn't know what else to give him. He was already taking the anti-gas drops, and eating anti-colicky formula. Once I tried one of the Dr. Browns Bottles, I stop giving him anti-gas drops, and he is very happy. Another great thing about those bottles they have the softest silicon nipples, that prevents spit-ups. I use both sizes. And of course, YOU CAN NOT go above the line, because it will leak. So if you need to feed more then 4oz, use the 8oz. bottle."
98810,2,"good price, but stupid shippingthey couldn't deliver this item, and the order returned.they refunded only part of money and i paid and i lost all saved money of online order because of this unexpected returnyou should be careful when ordering something online"
145248,1,"we purchased the jumperoo for our infant and although he is just two months old we went ahead and assembled it just for kicks. well, our little guy is very tall for two months and has excellent head control and he loves it! he can make it bounce and he loves to stare up at the hanging frog and bird. he actually cries if i take him out too soon! this toy is an excellent investment!"
135750,1,Dr. Brown bottles truly are what they claim to be!!We started using these bottles when our son was 3 weeks oldafter he was suffering from severe gas pains and always spitting up. We were using Playtex Ventaires and they were terrible.Once we started using Dr. Brown bottles he had a significant reduction in gassiness and his spitting up is now minimal. I would recommend this product to anyone that bottle feeds. Don't waste your money on other bottles!!!! They may take some extra time when washing/sterilizing but it's well worth it!
112906,1,I love these wipes. I like the fabric feel and the fact that they are completely chemical free!! They stay really wet in the wipe warmer. The first one might be a little dry but it's still useable. My only complaint was the first time we ordered these they would be pretty dry and then some would be wet but it didn't change how well they worked. They don't have an overwhelming smell with some fragrance that isn't meant for there skin. His baby butt loves them too!
159979,1,"This is exactly what we were needing. We needed a gate for the bottom of the stairs but our stairway has a wood baseboard that runs along the bottom - so the bottom of the gate would need to come in about an inch more than the top of the gate. We were so frustrated we couldn't find any gates that worked. Then I found this gem. I really wanted a permanent gate, but figured I'd have to settle for one you remove and set back up every single time you need to cross the path it's blocking. But once I opened it I realized it came with hardware to make it permanent! I was so excited. I quickly installed the pieces and it works beautifully. We're going to purchase another one for the top of our stairs."
74311,0,"My monitor worked great for the first 4 months we used it. Like others said, I could even hear my son breathing. Then it stopped working, but the lights were still on, so I had no idea there was a problem until I awoke to my son's screams from down the hall (who knows how long he had been crying before I heard him?) I have tried it a few times since, and it always works for a few minutes before I hear no sounds at all from the receiver. I just tried to give feedback on the Graco website, but the Graco webmaster did not recognize the recipient. I will call them tomorrow, but the website said that the warranty service (available for 1 year) is only available with proof of purchase. I threw away the receipt a long time ago! I think I will have to buy a different monitor."
119437,1,"As a first-time mother who had very little experience with babies prior to having my own, I had difficulty getting the hang of breast-feeding. That being said, if I had used the pillow from the onset, maybe it would have made it easier! I tried the boppy but felt like my baby was sliding off of it and unbalanced. Additionally, it had a much smaller platform. Unlike some of the other reviewers, my baby doesn't seem to find it uncomfortable at all and often falls asleep while on the pillow. My husband even uses it to feed him from the bottle every now and again.I would dock half a point for the fact that you usually need two hands to get that strap around you. But because I like that with the strap, the pillow won't slide around and therefore it frees up your hands for feeding, I think it's closer to a five=star than a four-star."
180785,1,I love the green and the fact that its so easy to fold away. My son loves this and is always in it.
25798,1,"This Stroller has been great... it is like owning a Bugaboo but way cheaper... We have used this stroller for over 16 months... it is extremely well built. Living in the city, a stroller with some tires to absorb the jagged streets is important... it is not super heavy but if you want to travel on buses, cars, etc., it isn't the right stroller for you... we use a Maclaren for times when portability is essential... besides portability, the Maclaren stroller is a piece of junk compared to this stroller. As far as the complaint about the wheels, just use some WD-40 or graphite spray if necessary... we sprayed one time 16 months ago and never have had to spray the wheel mechanism again... and for those complaining about not enough sun protection, just buy a sun protector... they sell them all over and they are not expensive. The bugaboo has a tiny umbrella... the sunshade we bought works perfectly. Again, the sunshade is really cheap and it works great on sunny days... finally, yes, there isn't a lot of bag room under the carriage but certainly has been enough for essentials... overall, it has been a wonderful stroller and is in perfect condition after 16 months... we use it all the time... this is definitely a ""luxury"" stroller... it is well made and our son is very comfortable in it. Highly recommend it!"
180040,1,"My Medela has been a lifesaver over the last 10 months. My son gets around now, so I prefer the manual pump to use at home because it allows me the flexibility to pump anywhere, anytime - quietly! While he's taking a nap or just playing, I pump efficiently without the hassle of wires and tubes. I also like that I can control the speed. It's a quality product that I would definitely recommend to other new moms."
88529,2,We have been purchasing Pampers Baby Dry through Amazon Prime Subscribe and Save. This last shipment of diapers were horrible. Pampers has lost our business. The diapers were paper thin and my 14 month old boy kept waking up soaked through. Leaving the bed soaking wet. Something is horribly wrong with these diapers. We will be changing to another brand ASAP.
154882,1,"This is the only swaddle blanket that my son cannot wiggle his way out of. He loves it, and it's the only thing that gets him to sleep. I have tried the woombie, and halo swaddlers & both cover his face & he Is able to get his hands free"
171630,1,"The tub worked great from the first days when we used the sling, to later when he was sitting up in the tub, to later still when we put this tub in the ""real"" tub as a transition. It is easy to clean. The drain works well. The small storage box on the end is the right size for a bottle of baby soap and a wash cloth. It sat securely on the sink, hooking easily over the lip. There are no amazing extras... it just works as it should, and when you're dealing with small babies and baths that's really what you want."
128241,0,"Although this is excellent quality it has one thing wrong with it that just happens to be a very major OOPS! I can't find any water bottles that will fit the holders!!! The opening is SMALL and SKINNY like a baby bottle. The closest I've found still has to be ""wrestled"" in and out. Inconvenient and disappointing. :(On a positive note, I found the openings can be stretched out without any damage. I wedged a 22oz Johnson's Baby Powder into the opening and rotated it around at 12,3,6,9 (think the face of a clock) and left it at each for about an hour. I think because the container is shaped somewhere between square and oblong with rounded edges it worked great.It is easy to attach to your stroller, fits perfectly and very secure. The zippered pocket looks small but holds more than you'd think. It's about 5 1/2 inches across and fairly deep.Now that I was able to enlarge the openings I love it, but if that didn't work I would have sent it back."
77725,2,This product injured my toddler when it dumped him from our counter top. I think this product has been subject to a recall for precisely this reason.
18326,1,"I have a 10 week old son who is extremely fussy and colicky. For the first 6 weeks of his life, I couldn't put him down (awake) without him screaming and crying. Then I borrowed the Baby Einstein Playgym from a friend to see what he thought, and I ended up ordering one that day! My son LOVES it, especially the musical star that lights up. He can lay down and be captivated by it for 30 minutes or more sometimes!! My fussy little sweetheart kicks his legs and waves his arms and is so excited when he watches the star. I used 4 of the links to make the ladybug reach down to his arms, and he can even activate the star when I put it on ""motion activated"". What a lifesaver this toy has been for me----I can actually take a shower or unload the dishwasher without having to listen to a screaming baby!! :)"
30746,1,This works wonderfully for us. We can keep one parent unit in the kitchen and one in the bedroom so we can always hear the baby. It's also nice that I can talk to my husband in the kitchen while I'm feeding the baby in the nursery in case I need something. We have a wireless network in our house and we have had no interference.
8128,1,Good quality. Bigger than I anticipated but very nice and did its job for me. I put all my 10 month old daughters toys in them :)
39942,0,"The sound choices on the DEX sound machine were nice and sounded great, but the volume was too low. Unfortunatly, I could hear noises from my kitchen 16 feet away with my sound machine volume turned as high as it could go and bedroom door shutt. My house is very well insulated. I recomment trying another sound machine."
164683,1,We love pampers diapers they fit our boy girl twins very well. We have tried huggies and store brand diapers before and were very disappointed in them. Pampers is all we will use! And we use alot!
122791,1,"We had already tried a different type to get reflux meds in our little girl without great luck. This one lets you ""push"" the med through, much like a syringe. It is a bit fragile on the plunger side but it does seem to work pretty good and for the price we are very pleased. Might be worth buying 2-3 of them to have on hand for back up."
171779,1,"I love the hammock feature! A shower hose would have made this product perfect. I expected the hammock to start getting stinky from continued use, but it didn't. I would recommend this product to any new parent because of the practicality and price. I'm going to buy one for a pregnant friend and fill it with bath accessories."
113217,1,We used the single Chicco stroller with similar design and were happy with it and decided to buy the Chicco twin stroller when our second was old enough for the umbrella style stroller. We are happy with this stroller. It is easy to use (open and close) and compact enough to easily maneuver in and out of a car trunk. Only thing I would change is to have the sun shade fold down a bit more to provide better coverage.
33811,0,"very unsatisfied. This item, for the money is like travel size. If that is what you are looking for then you will be pleased. I was looking for much larger bottles. The product itself is great!!"
127426,1,"I purchased this crib for my upcoming first grandchild on his parent's recommendation. It arrived promptly and in perfect shape. It was easy to assemble. The crib can be converted into a youth bed with shorter sides and then later into a twin size bed, so it can be used for years with just the addition of a couple rails (sold separately) and the twin mattress and box springs."
69026,2,"Like many of the previous posters, I have been using Pampers since my son was born almost two years ago. The new ones are terrible. They leak to the point that my son wakes up because he's soaking wet every night (necessitating a diaper and pajama change, which completely wakes him up, so it takes a good hour or two before he settles down and goes back to sleep). I'm hugely disappointed, have contacted Pampers Customer Service but no response yet. In the meantime, am also searching for a new diaper."
143965,1,"Love this product, easy to install and easy to remove. Very sturdy and have been holding my gate up for about 7-9 months now."
80121,1,I bought this item for my son who was 6 months old at the time. From the time I assembled it and he saw it his eyes lit up. When I placed him on the mat he immediately began stretching to grap whatever toys he could. It was wonderful to see him having fun and also proving money well spent. This gym kept him active and occupied. He loved the musical puppy the most. he was fascinated by the ways the lights flickered on and off. I recommend this product for any parent wishing to introduce something new to their new borns.
26249,1,"We bought the carrier to use on our first airplane trip with our daughter. It had tons of room! We should have practiced first - instead, we were trying to figure out which way the car seat fit in the bag in the dark at the airport. But once we got that figured out, there was still room for a blanket, 3 winter coats, and excess toys, etc. of our daughter's. It would be nice if the bag has wheels, as it's a little cumbersome as a duffle bag - but that's what Dad's are for! The fabric is very sturdy and there is a small zippered pouch on the outside to put the strap in when checking the bag."
6390,2,"I gave it 2 stars because this video monitor worked wonderfully for us - when it worked. I have had 5 of these monitors and the longest any of them has lasted is one year. The sound has always stopped working for one reason or another on the monitor. The reason I have had so many is simple: the first time it broke, it was our fault. So we had the extra camera so we figured why not buy another one and we can have 2 camera's that way we can switch which side of the crib we wanted to view based on where the baby had moved to. But then the next 4 monitors broke so I just kept returning them. Once I did try another brand, but that one didn't even work AT ALL once I brought it home, so I had to treck back up to Babies R Us to return it. My suggestion is to try another one out there that's on the market."
120902,1,"This is the second dreambaby gate that I bought for my one year old. The first one was the tall gate for the top of the stairs and this is a regular one for the bottom of the stairs. It is very easy to assemble and it fits well in standard size hallways/doorways.The only thing is that I like the tall one much better, even though it seems like the shorter one would be more comfortable... its the exact opposite, you dont have to bend down to open it with the baby in your arms unlike with the short one. This product is great, but I would recommend the tall gate over the short one."
59787,1,"We tried a bunch of different tubs with slings, cushions, padding, ""too hot"" indicators, etc. For the most part they are too small, the slings were too high or too difficult to get in and out of, the indicators were not very reliable, they didn't provide enough leg room or the opportunity for any sort of enjoyment in a tub. My baby likes being warm in his tub. As a result, he likes being decently submerged (he hated sponge baths) and the Eurobath allows you to actually get a real bath without being afraid that if your hand acidentally slips, the baby will slide under water. From birth to about 6 months, I used a hand towel under him (in the water) to give him some extra cushioning and a hand towel (in the water) on top to keep him extra warm. He loved watching me wring it out on his tummy. Now, he likes to sit up and the towels are gone, but Ms. Rubber Ducky has plenty of room to swim and my boy can make bubbles by splashing with his arms and legs. The molding is nice and secure. Be aware this is a BIG tub so if you are space constrained, it will be a challenge to find a good spot for it. It can get pretty heavy when filled and draining takes a while, but it is well worth both the cost and the little extra inconvenience to have a tub that doesn't leak, and especially one which makes bathtime a lot of fun, rather than a traumatic experience!"
130998,1,The Maya Wrap came quick and on time. The owner was very helpful and nice about the order even the exchange for the correct color.
56687,0,the hot thing is wonderful and works but unfortunatly they will not help us as they are to big for our windows.
98406,0,"I thought I was buying a tub and not a boat! I like the soft sides and support this tub gives but the floating of the tub makes me nervous. I never leave my baby alone by water, but even to take a hand off her when in this tub makes me nervocs I would hate for her to tip! My older girls want to get in the water with her but with it floating I don't like that idea. I think if the product was heaver and did not float I would like it better."
108430,1,"I purchased this for my 22 month old son who showed signs of being ready for potty training, but just refused to sit on the little potties that sit on the floor. He LOVES this seat and potty training has been an absolute breeze. The rubber bits that you stick on the bottom prevent any sliding and he's absolutely secure even without holding onto the well positioned handles. I love it because after he's done, we just flush everything away. No more potty cleaning for me (which I found far more distasteful than changing dirty diapers). It's light and compact enough that I am able to put it in a grocery bag in my son's backpack and take it with us wherever we go so that he can use public restrooms and still feel ""at home"" with the whole toilet experience."
98211,2,"I just bought this gate last night and am very disappointed. This is absolutely the worst gate I have ever dealt with and I have used quite a few in my years as a child care provider, as an aunt and as a parent. First, the instructions are not as clear as they could be, but I can work around that. Second, it has not just the one little metal button on the handle to open it with. There are 3 more that you have to use to adjust the thing! Impossible to do through the mesh on the door part. Third, the only reason I even gave it one star is because once I got it tightened in to the door frame, even the Incredible Hulk couldn't have budged it. But then I couldn't open the walk-thru portion, so I tried loosening the bolt a bit...and the top of the gate fell out of the doorway!! I chose this gate because it was taller than most and we could walk through rather have to climb over. Well, I am taking it right back to the store and buying the stationary mesh gate that costs half as much, which is what I should have done to start with."
136819,1,These are wonderful latches! You can actually slide it off (I have round knobs) with one hand easily if needed. And my 2 year old daughter has messed with it a time or 2 and just gave up on it altogether. Its a constant visual reeminder also for her to just stay out of the cabinets and it works!
173392,1,"This swing really has been a lifesaver! We bought this swing when my daughter was only 2weeks old. She is now 3 months and still loving it. She seldom has a chance to enjoy the mobile or toys because she pretty much ALWAYS falls asleep in it with in 3-5 min's. She naps in it every day for at least 1-2 hours at a time. I just put it on the lowest setting (it has 6 total) so that it's just barely moving & she falls fast asleep. I think that she likes how cozy it is & she seems to like the side to side cradle action best. When she's in the more traditional swings, sitting upright, front to back swings she gets bored quickly. However, with this one it's off to sleepy time! Plus there's the added bonus of the neutral colors & it blends in nicely with our living room furniture! This has been the very best purchase we've made so far! For us it is an absolute ""must have""! It's worth a little extra $$$"
55175,1,I love Pampers wipes. They are the only wipes that do not cause my daughters eczema to flare up!
45007,0,"i purchased this gym 2 months ago and i think i got this a little too late. my baby enjoyed it for awhile, but out grew it quickly, she's now 8-months-old. but compared to other baby gyms i like it the most. all the toys are removable so she can still play with them and it has a little mirror so she can look at herself."
182722,1,Diaper is very reliable and rarely leaks.My son loves the colors and shapes.Only a few had defects where the velcro would rip off.
61727,1,"Having been disappointed with many name brand and generic diapers for various reasons (poor fit for my toddler, breaking open and leaving granules on her bottom, leaks, etc), I tried Fitti. They were perfect. They do leak upon occasion, but so do every other diaper I ever tried - sometimes, the baby's wiggles and the dispensation of liquid just coincide to make a leak. It happens. I like the tabs, and the height of the waistband is reasonable (I laughed when I saw one brand on my daughter, the waistband went up to her chest!). The wet-dry indicator balloons are a hit with my toddler, too.My favorite diaper, and so I buy them over and over. Blessings to all!"
66272,0,"We thought this was going to be the perfect seat, however after a couple of weeks use we found the edging had fraid and the sponge foam was ill fitted at the sides, and the Diamond material is not the best to use for a car seat.We found it hard to adjust the seat angle as well as the release button to enable the straps to be adjusted was quite ackward. It does appear that paying more for an item doesn't necessarily mean that it is better quality."
71647,1,"Great Buy!! I like this carrier much better than the Baby Bjorn carriers and it is much easier to wash and care for. The adjustments are easy to do and baby can be taken in/out with one hand. You can wash/stain treat the carrier without it fading (I have a euro with a grey nylon cover) and it is EXTREMLY lightweight and comfortable. I have bought &amp; tried every Snigli ever made plus the $50 Graco carrier version with no luck and for comparison, recently tried 4 different Baby Bjorn carriers and this one beats them all hands down."
147128,1,"These are great--fun for kids to play with, easy to clean up. Absolutely my daughter's favorite bath toy ever."
102904,1,"This is the most economical and practical diaper pail you can own. It is just the ideal size and it does keeps odors in if you are breast-feeding. Formula-fed babies will always have stinky diapers no matter what pail you use. The diaper genie is expensive over-time and the diaper champ looks like a giant diaper pail its ridiculous but if you want to spend more, that's fine. For those of you who want the best you can get at a great price, this pail is the one."
12735,2,"I have never been able to hear a baby's heartbeat with this device, in fact, I don't think I heard anything, on slight occasion, I heard my own heartbeat when held to my chest - just to make sure it even worked, I work in OB, so you think I would be able to find a baby heartbeat, I found dissapointment instead.Not useful, Not even amusing or entertaining."
127130,2,I cannot express how diasppointed I am with these diapers. These is the second or third box I have received that has been what I consider defective. The adhesive tabs rip off so easily and are put on backward so you have to twist the sticky tab to get it to work. This morning I tried to use two separate diapers and the tabs ripped off the diaper completely and were unusable. I will never ever purchase another box of huggies. The quality has gone down considerably in the past couple years!
122506,1,"We ordered this kit after looking at many others on the market, we found this kit to be th emost bang for your buck. The kit is all inclusive and easy to use, with enough stars of different sizes to make many constlations and designs. The planets that are included also glow, which i found some of the other kits did not offer planets at all."
59448,2,I registered for a diaper depot and will not be keeping it if I receive one. One of my friends tried to buy it for me and had to return it because it was broken in the package. She then found all of the ones in the store to be broken in their packages. This is not a good sign that it will be of any use long-term if it is being made with plastic that is too brittle.
131592,1,"I love the price. Incredibly cheap, but that comes at a price :-)The product quality is not the best. The handles are clever and make it easy to pick up. Color is perfect.After a while it starts to stain. Overall good value for money."
76906,0,"I bought this product at a garage sale for fifty dollars.The things I like about this product are the overall design, it is very modern looking.I like that you can change the speeds for the baby and I like the colors.The music however sounded low quality.Also my baby's head always fell over the side of the swing, defeating the purpose of the head cushion. When i took the cover off to wash it I also noticed that what the baby is actually resting on is just hard plastic and there is no cushion whatsoever.Another thing I did not like is that the mobile is neutral colors. Babies love brighter colors, so my daughter basically ignores the mobile."
4763,1,These diapers have worked out really well for us. Our baby was getting a bad rash with other brands but this has gone after using these diapers. They work just as well as the other top brands and are better for the environment.
28031,1,"Walker is easy to assemble and need about 15 minutes by maximum to get rolling. Our son is 4 months old and enjoys a lot while in the walker. Small animals on the front table attract his attention quite often. It is very safe and fit for the carpet floor. So far we have observed no downside excpet that we have to be care ful while taking the baby out of the walker as legs may get stuck with the seat holes. Overall, we are strongly satisfied by this product."
94735,0,"I just received these, and I'm really disappointed. Number one---they are made in Pakistan. Number two, They are incredibly thin. I keep looking at the package and it says there are 15 in there, but it's hard to believe. These are going back."
161369,2,I really wish I could get my money back on this thing! It is not user friendly at all. The sling does not fit properly into the section where it's supposed to go. The part in the bottom where it is connected scrapes my babys' bottom. I just had a c-section and have to put the tub on the counter. No matter what I do to make sure the stopper is sealed and the bottom is pushed down it leaks water all over the place. This product is too over priced. I would not recommend it to anybody. I'm buying a new this week.
121556,1,"I use this for my catbox. I scoop into a plastic bag, keeping odor discs in the compartment under the lid. Stops the smell. Since it's emptied every couple of days, there's no smell in the house."
145599,1,"I can't say enough about this product. I got it for my daughter when she was just 2 and a half months. At first she did not seem to enjoy much, probably she was too small.She fall to sleep whenever i put her in there. When she was three months she start to enjoy it so much. I guess baby didnt want to lay down or be hold all the time.This Jumperoo support her body in standing position so she learn how to jump and balance herself very well. While she is enjoying her jumperoo, I able to do some small cleaning around the house."
131580,2,"It is not perfect, but it does the job. Never had a pinching issue like I had read about. fitting on public seats is an issue because most are oblong and this is designed for round seats. Works fine for boys and girls, we keep in a ziploc bag."
156479,0,Warmer is good. Just be sure that you keep a close eye on it after the first 2 mintues or you will have scalding hot milk. As long as you pay attention it is a great product. Works a lot faster than the bowl of hot water method I was using! Bottles are a waste of money. Leak even when properly assembled and give baby BAD gas. (you can hear baby swallowing air and hear the bubbles in the tummy after just one ounce)Playtex vent-aire and playtex dropin bottles cause MUCH less gas. Playtex bottles Do fit into bottle warmer though... :)
121772,1,"The Boppy is great for positioning baby for breastfeeding, and helps alleviate back pain. Regular pillows don't stay put like the Boppy does. Also, it comes in handy for propping baby up on the floor before he can sit. Buy two covers - one to use and one to wash. One of the most useful pieces of baby gear I had. I buy one for all my expectant friends."
7240,1,This is a very nice and sturdy little bed it was worth every penny. Easy to install it only took 20 mins.
62799,1,"I don't know about the ""old"" Diaper Genie. We got the ""new"" one as a shower gift before our son arrived. My six-week-old goes through a dozen diapers in a day some days. Despite what the lactation folks tell you, the poop of a breastfed baby DOES stink - big time! Once the dirty diaper goes into the Diaper Genie you don't smell a thing anymore. I've been in nurseries where the diaper pail just smells awful. The Diaper Genie film actually has a pleasant baby powder odor. So no bad smells, no matter how much you stuff it. I change mine just once a week and I can cram a LOT of diapers in there. It's easy to use, easy to empty and easy to replace the film. My only complaint is the cost of replacement cartridges. The Diaper Genie is only $25, but the refills are $7 and $8! But I'm hooked. I foresee us using this sturdy item for as long as my son is in diapers."
34454,0,"I like the idea of this camera, but it has to be very close to your child at night to be able to see anything. we wanted to use it to make sure a 12-18 mo old was ok at night and not crawling out of bed, can not put it close enough to see her."
36979,0,"I am sorry to say that I just returned this car seat. Based on Consumer Reports, and my own research, I thought this was the car seat for us. I ignored the negative feedback on this site and I should not have. First of all, the seat seemed great as far as my son was concerned. He will be 3 years old in September, 37 lbs, and 40"" tall. We bought this so he could use it as a booster as soon as he gains 3 more lbs. He loved the feel of it, loved the cup holder and it was very roomy for him. When I tried to put it in my SUV it was impossible to get tight enough. I drive an Isuzu Rodeo w/out LATCH. I tried it on in the middle and the outer edges of the seat. We could get it semi-tight in the middle but we are expecting #2 so it has to be on the outer edge. Pulling it as tight as we could the seat would move about 8"" - 10"". That is just not acceptable. We took the base off of it and were able to get it very tight. However, without the base my son didn't have his cup holder and cried and it made the seat lower so he didn't get that up high big boy feeling. I actually liked the seat better without the base because it is quite a bulky seat. So I am sorry to say that I can't recommend this seat for everyone. I bought a Platinum CarGo by Graco. We'll see how it goes. I've yet to try and put it in my car."
147740,0,"When we registered, we decided to get all the main items by Peg Perego in Black/Sable; high chair, carseat, stroller. And yes, the carseat looks really nice, but there is nothing special about it. The thing that really bothers me is the hood, which I need to use a lot more than I expected. Every time I try to pull the hood down to shield my daughter's eyes from the sun, the whole thing pulls off. You would think for the cost they would at least put in a few snaps or something to hold it in place. If you are not sure about spending the extra money, don't..it's really not worth it."
66682,1,This is an excellent stroller for the price. We've taken it everywhere and it cruises over all of it without any problems. There is good coverage from the sun. Easy to operate foot brake. Lots of room for a growing baby. It is easy to steer due to the revolving front wheel which can be locked if necessary. I always feel sorry for people I see with the fixed three wheel strollers. Those things cant turn...
75920,1,"These silicone nipple covers work perfectly to conceal high beams! Even with a padded bra, I used to have show-through when I got cold at work. The combination of these covers and a bra provide modesty at any temperature. They have a natural-looking profile even without a bra (unlike another brand I tried, which looked like I was wearing 2 clown noses). And they're very comfortable; despite my sensitive skin I've had no irritation and soon forget I'm wearing them."
18116,0,"I received this as a gift but I would like to have seen what other mats out there have something more substantial for baby's tummy time. Some crinkly bits or different textures would have been nice since my daughter was very into touch. The overhead hanging things are ok, the musical star is the best feature but the movement sensor isn't that sensitive - I usually have to get up and turn it off & on again to get it to go. My baby liked me gently shaking the frame to make the toys move. I think there are better things out there for the money."
115543,1,"Upon using, my skin feels so clean and has no irration. Skin feels like it should."
55076,2,"I would not recomend this sling for use with infants over 10 lbs. I purchased this sling because I had always wanted to try a sling in contrast to a front style carrier. I was so dissapointed in this sling that I returned it after attempting to use it several times.Firstly, breastfeeding is impossible in contrast to the claims omn the package. Even on the shortest setting, my baby hung below my hip level, encapsulated by the thick material. I might as well have used a duffel bag as a carrier.Additionally, the design was poor. The interior harness was positioned in such a way as to allow insufficient room for the head and too much for the feetImmediatly upon entering the sling, my calm baby would scream and cry until I took him out. He preferred the freedom of an upright carrier rather than being immobilized by this sling. He would be red and damp with sweat. In fact when I'd take my baby out, the ridged imprints of the elastic were imprinted on his face.If your baby is older than six weeks or so, I would not reccomend this item. Perhaps this may useful for a baby that is newborn who mostly sleeps."
99463,0,"I switched from Pampers Cruisers to Pampers Baby Dry because the Baby Dry economy pack offers about a week's worth more diapers for about the same price. So far for every 5 diapers I use, I have to throw one out because the tabs just rip off as I secure the diaper around my little one - and that was rarely the case with Cruisers, unless we picked up a faulty box. Also, the fit around the leg and bottom is very loose, so these are NOT the best diapers to use for overnight."

3903,2,"I received this from my mother-in-law (she bought every conceivable accessory for our stroller). At first I liked this because it gave me more storage and cup holders. The only function that I actually used was the cup holders, which don't work as well as a hard cup holder would. While I used this bag, it caused more frustration than anything. It was always getting in the way and I was having to fold it up so that I could see what I was doing when folding it. The final straw came 6 months after using it. We had been having issues getting the stroller unfolded and I was considering sending the whole stroller back. As a last attempt, I took the bag off, and miracle of miracles! The stroller folds up fine! In my opinion, don't waste your money, just buy a standard cup holder!"
50871,0,Recieved my pillow today and opened it and there is no pillow case? I thought that I read that it came with one it was just scratchy? Well there is no other case with it just the pillow. I went ahead and ordered another one that cost $30. Oh well I'll try the pillow tonight anyway.
161779,2,"I decided to ignore the comments on leak and get this tub anywas based on the few positive comments stating that is do use properly this tub would not leak. First couple of time we used we did not get any leaks, but after using it for 1 1/2 month, I would get a leak every time we used it - no matter what I did or how well we followed directions. Its going back this week and I plan to get just a simple tub with no fuss... I recomend NOT to buy this product!"
147975,1,"My son loves his bouncer. He doesn't actually bounce by himself yet, he's only 4 months old, but he loves to kick with his feet and grab the toys. The toys are a little low but it doesn't bother us.The only thing I don't like is that I can't turn off the music and leave the lights on. It turns off for maybe 5 minutes, then it comes on by itself.My son doesn't like the music/forest sounds. He starts crying 5 min after listening to them. He loves the lights though.I tried adjusting the different music settings to totally off with no luck.We had a problem with the moving frogs. Every time they moved up and down they make this loud, continuous clicking sound. I had to take the unit apart and disable them. My son never paid attention to the frogs anyway.All in all it's a good toy. It really keeps my little one entertained for about 30-45 minutes at a time. He's so quiet sometimes that I forget he's in there."
175345,1,"It holds the snacks- and nothing falls out. My 11 month old can get the snacks out on his own. The plastic lid is solid enough to keep the snacks in, but soft enough the get little hands in.The only ""negative"" thing is that it is hardly gender neutral- the one I got was blue with a car on it. Not that that matters much."
178061,1,Good productI ordered and sent it back to my hometown.Still no problem now
16470,0,I only use this product for prevention. Since my 8 month old is drinking juice he pees a lot more. So I use it only before bed. It's cheap so I use a lot mixed with vasaline. Super protection for night time. I love it the max strength has way too much zinc for overnight use in my opinion. Probably suppose to use max if the baby has an active rash. But I opt for another cream for that purpose. But overall it's an okay product for prevention purposes. Also when u use it at night by morning it's not hard to wipe off. Happy bottoms make happy babies!!!!
175439,1,This is a good basic diaper cover. We had five of this size and five of the small size. They all lasted through diapering 2 kids and both were potty trained long before we would have had to move up to anything larger. Both of my kids were slim but we had no problems with leaks as long as the prefold diapers were tucked in everywhere. I did find that I needed to fasten the prefold with a Snappi fastenerSnappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Mint color mix). We used these mostly for daytime diapering and washed them together with the diapers. The laundry tabs are handy for preventing the velcro from sticking to other things in the laundry.
183146,1,"We have this bag in the x-large to line the pail, the medium for daycare and the small for quick outings. It is very durable and after over a year of washing 2-3 times a week, looks as good as it did brand new. My only complaint is that the fabric is not 100% waterproof and it does kind of ""sweat"" when ful of wet diapers."
176024,2,"This item is not friendly at ALL!! The manual that comes with this product only shows you some ways to go about using it and other than that nothing else. Now I know why the seller did not accept returns, cuz this item SUCKS!! Especially when you have a little one that you were going to use it for. I will never buy anything like this again without seeing it at the store!!"
54159,1,"This mobile was a life saver. It is so interesting and intriguing to watch all of the pieces that move as it rotates, that even I'M put in a trance. My son showed interest in it as early as 2-weeks old. Now that he's 13 months old, he still uses the music portion of the mobile, with the actual mobile removed, and he can easily operate the buttons himself.My only complaints are:1.) This is a heavy mobile, so sometimes, during rotation, the whole thing will fall of to the side. Once or twice the whole thing had fallen on my son, but he didn't seemed bothered by it.2.) The bolt that screws it to the railing of the crib is slightly small, and when the weight of the mobile pulls the mobile to the side, the whole thing removes itself from the crib.These were things that didn't happen to often, and we were able to improvise solutions."
161012,1,"The messenger-style strap is very handy when also trying to carry a baby (especially in his car seat). There are three decent-sized compartments on the outside, plus a couple of slots large enough to stick a bottle into. I wish the main compartment were bigger. By the time we get wipes, the changing pad, and a few spare diapers in there it is stuffed. The changing pad that comes with the diaper bag is big enough and folds up; you don't need to buy a separate one."
183791,1,This is the best probiotic out there in my opinion. I am having to have major dental work done and lots of antibiotics. As soon as t finish a course of antibiotics I take my HMF and it kicks my system back to normal
162536,2,I agree with 'Kat' from Utah. I had the same exact experience with this tub. The tub had collapsed with my infant son in it! Thank goodness I had a hold on him!DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT-IT IS SO DANGEROUS!The idea is good in theory however NOT in safety. And safety must come first not convenience when it comes to our babies.
138452,1,"Saw this in a baby mag & decided to purchase through amazon. Our 2mo old son loves it, it totally captures his attention just before bed & is just lovely to look at. Hands down the best projection of any toy we bought or received. The stars in all the colors are just great & there's actual constellations, which will be great when he's older. Planning to gift this to several friends."
923,1,"After using lots of other disposable diapers (including Kuddles, Luvs, Huggies, and Cruisers), I've decided that Pampers Baby Dry are the only diaper I'll continue to use on my son at this age. Luvs are too thin, smell funny and you can feel the moisture absorbing pellets in them. Huggies and Kuddles are too bulky and fit funny. Pampers Cruisers are the second best to Pampers Baby Dry, but I believe they caused diaper rash, plus with the whole rash controversy, I just don't feel comfortable using them. Baby Dry's are just perfect. They fit like a glove, can hold anything without leaks, and my son walks comfortably in them and doesn't get diaper rash. In short, they're the BEST DIAPER EVER!!!"
118346,0,"I just bought these items, I just hope they will give me option to choose what color I would want. I have 2 girls and the colors that shipped to me are orange(this is fine) and blue(how I wish this could have been pink).First of all, I love the flexibility of changing the spout into nipples and use the handle to other avent bottles. It all fits so I can interchangeably use it. The girls love the spout because they love biting it with their gums, its really soft so I don't have any worries about it. The problem is with the valve, they cannot drink if it is placed. If not, they will get wet. Now I have to figure out how to help them drink using the valve, or drink properly without the valve."
122523,1,"For $70 I changed my daughter's bedroom into outer space:$20 - these stars, worked really well though I wish they gave you a bit more of the adhesive putty$20 - glow in the dark planets2x$15 - two 71 cm flourescent blacklightsThe blacklights really help give the stars and planets an errie glow...Overall turned out much better than I expected, kids love it."
46714,2,"This swing is cute and I put it together myself while I was late in my pregnancy so that is not the issue i have with this swing. Now that my daughter is alomost 6 months and is more active, I have almost gotten her fingers in the hinges twice while trying to close the tray. I was always worried about pinching her legs while closing the tray due to the design. So I was busy looking down at her legs the other day and meanwhile she grabbed at the side near the hinges as I was closing the tray. I think it's a comfortable swing but I dislike the tray design and feel it is potentionally a hazard. For that reason alone I would not recommend this swing. And I have to agree with other reviews about it not working all the time....sometimes it swings and sometimes it doesn't. Seems to have a mind of it's own..."
53038,0,"Applied easily, seems to stay in place unless really pulled onDoes what it is should and hopefully will remove without takingthe finish off."
31824,1,"My daughter was extremely gassy for the first 6 weeks of her life. Around 2 am...after no sleep and sitting up with a crying child, I started googling remedies! Gripe Water came up several times, I did some research, left the baby with my husband and went to Walgreens at 3 am to get a bottle. At WalGreens there was only 1 bottle left on the shelf, and the cashier at the desk said it was the greatest stuff.When I got home I gave it to my daughter and within 15 minutes she was sound asleep. You could actually hear and feel this stuff loosen her belly-up. This was the only stuff that gave us peace....Mylicon didn't work, we even went homeopathic and tried Nettle Tea and Chamomile tea - didn't work. The Gripe Water is the honest to God best invention in the world. It saved mine and my husband's sanity! OUr daugther is now 5 months old and awesome. We don't use the Grip Water anymore because there is no need for it :) But I do recommend it, and I give it to all my girlfriends expecting a baby!!"
92511,2,"Seriously, this item is crap. It doesn't grind up anything. I use my food processor for most things."
177173,1,"I don't know what other people are doing with thier tables, but I use mine for changing the baby (have used it for 5 months now) and storing her reciveing blankets, extra packs of diapers, burp cloths, extra wipes, etc. and mine has never wobbled once. It was really easy to put together too. I think this is the best changing table and cheapest also. Why buy one for &lt;more&gt; when this one is perfect? And when baby is potty trained, you can turn it into a bookshelf for all those tons of books you recieved when they were younger."
105641,2,"The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile. When the diapers get bigger, or if you have a messy one that leaks a bit as it's being pushed down into the system, BEWARE. We noticed that the odor coming from the Champ was stronger than normal even when we cleaned it & it was empty. Upon closer inspection we noticed that between the weight that pushes the diapers down, and the side of the 'chute' on the Champ, that there was quite a hidden mess. This mess was nearly impossible to clean and we were disgusted by it. Bottom line, this wasn't bad for a little while, but after seeing (and smelling) that disgusting mess, I'm going back for the Genie, expensive bags & all."
23970,0,"the NICU where our daughter was used these and we thought they were great, this one isn't as nice as what they had the Velcro is rough and I worried about it scratching baby. perhaps this will resolve with washing."
94319,2,I used Playtex bottles with my first child with no problems. I bought into all the Avent hype with my second and bought them. We hated them. They were such a huge hassle. We assembled them correctly and still had leaks. Over the past two years I have talked with many other moms who had the same complaint and swear never to use Avent bottles again because of leaks. Wish I had know that two years ago! We are now expecting our third child and I will go back to Playtex bottles.
35834,1,I had this on my registry and thank God somebody brought it. It is super warm. I use it in his Macalern stroller. It got dirty and I just popped it in the machine. I haven't had any problems with any shedding. I highly recommend this!
184839,1,"I purchased this stroller around $95 with free shipping. For that price, it is pretty good quality.I have 2 complains about this product1) This jogging stroller is kinda big to fit in Small SUV's trunk.2) Break is hard to set up. I spend couple hours setting up the break, but couldn't make it to work. So I took it to bike shop and they set it up nicely for $15.00"
49346,2,"This item would work well if your child is in the crawling stage. However, if your child is walking then this is not for them. My son is able to push the gate where he wants it. And because it is so light he is also able to pick it up and escape."
37261,1,"The Cosco Summit High Back Car Seat arrived in 8 days with regular shipping. Upon opening, the seat was exactly as I had pictured it to be. I had read the previous consumer reviews and was aware of the ""buckle/straps too short"" complaint... and, yes, the strap/buckle could be better redesigned to accommodate growing human legs... but decided that this seat was the best BANG for the buck - $74.54. Which it is.My 2 1/2 year old daughter was filled with glee upon inspection. She exclaimed, ""Look at the sparkles, Momma"". Phew! That hurdle conquered. (I had thought, as I placed my order, that a little girl might not appreciate the practicality of a dark color.) There does, however, exist a ""sparkle"" in the silver metallic fabric that is not visible in the photos available online. She loves her ""big girl car seat"".I hope that I was able to aid you in your quest! :)"

79902,0,"I bought three of these to go with the 12 oz Kleen Kanteens I was getting. The pink one fits like a dream, the green one was a very tight struggle to get on and off, the blue one I could not get on at all. I ended up taking a Kleen Kanteen with me to a local store and getting two more there that fit no problem. If they fit, they are a great sleeve for the Kleen Kanteen, but I have to return 2 of 3!"
113242,1,I am very pleased with the diaper bag. It's cute and has tons of room (without being too bulky).
88154,1,I received two activity mats at a shower so I keep this one at grandma's house. My 10 week old son responds better to this mat because of it's bold colors. He loves the turtle because he can see himself in the mirror. All of the hanging animals are his new friends!
83437,1,"I bought this because it seemed way easier to slide over my regular stroller (Peg Perego Pliko) in the rain than other items I saw. When my son was smaller and in the infant seat it covered the infant seat and most of the stroller. Now that my little one is out of the infant seat, it works even better for the times when you have to leave the house but the rain is really bad. It is INCREDIBLY quick to just throw on in a parking lot. It's not that expensive, and to me it has served super handy. Would totally recommend it!"
24219,0,I like this sheet- it fits perfectly but it is rough and not soft at all. I put a waterproof pad on top to make it more comfortable for my baby.
102406,1,"Fisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical MobileI bought this for our house so that when my grandson comes to visit, he will have a mobile to sleep by. When my daughter brought him over, she loved it so much that I bought her one and she gave away the one she already had. There are some cool features on this mobile. For example, it has a remote control for turning it on and off. This way, you don't have to enter the room and disturb the sleeping baby. Also, it has a rainforest sound of crickets and other creatures that I find to be very relaxing (there are classical music sounds as well). It has adjustable volume controls and the leaves go up and down. You can tell it is well made and will last for years. I highly recommend this mobile."
40265,1,I have tried Huggies on my sons but Pampers by far seem to be the better fit. Love buying them online because I can get a great bulk price plus free shipping. Best deal I know of!
123295,1,I absolutely love this pack n play! It is big and spacious. my baby was afraid of it at first but now she is in love with it ans she is entertained by the colorful built-in toys. the pad is comfy she often falls asleep on it! I'm very happy I got this for my baby!:) Highly recommended.
128675,1,"Avent is a great manufacturer. My son is ill and has been on bottles for two years. He's just now starting to wear out the 6 month old nipples. The bottles hold 9 oz., are stable (wide instead of tall!) and are very comfortable to handle (use the 4 oz. bottles for smaller babies)."
175351,0,"***********************************I ordered this for my nephew's 3rd birthday. When it arrived, I tested it out and even put in fresh batteries. Something was wrong with the one that I got because the voice was garbled and slurred, and the movement was choppy. It seems to be a fragile bank, but since my nephew loves Darth Vader, I quickly asked for a replacement. Amazon.com is great with exchanges because they handled my situation immediately and shipped out a replacement just in time for my nephew to receive it. Otherwise, Darth Vadar is menacing-looking, the sound is unreal LOUD, and the fact that the light-saber lights up as Darth Vader lifts his arm up and around is so cool. Oh, his cape thing is made of soft rubber so there's some movement to it too. The other reviewer said there's no movement when a coin is dropped in...I think that's a defect in his/her bank cuz mine goes through the whole song and dance when I drop a coin in."
149301,0,"I had heard wonderful things about the Leachco Snoogles, so I bought this body pillow from Leachco with high hopes. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed.The pillow is designed to go under your head and down either side of your body. It does give great support to both your back and belly. It is great if you frequently flip from side to side- you don't have to reposition the pillow.There were several things I didn't like, however. First, it is uncomfortable under my head. I'm used to sleeping on a down pillow and I like to be able to squish my pillow around my head. I couldn't do that with the Back 'N Belly because it was flattened by the fact that it was connected to the parts that went down each side of my body. I tried putting a thin down pillow over it and that helped, but then it almost lifted my head too high.I also found that the cover caused the pillow to be too stiff. It felt like the cover was stretched too tight across the top. It was quite uncomfortable stretching over or under my shoulder. I finally removed the cover and it is much more comfortable without it. Unfortunately, it is not washable without the cover and the fabric on the pillow itself is thin and pills very easily.Overall, I'm disappointed and I wish I hadn't spent over $50 for this pillow."
74013,1,"I use this stroller for my baby and 4yr old and it has proved invaluable. The only this is I wish it had more storage room, but I guess that would defeat the purpose of it not being bulky."
159624,2,"My son didin't care for the sounds and music it played and to be honest they weren't very entertaining to myself or my husband. We have recently had to look for a new bouncer because while my son was in it and bouncing away the left side where the bars that hold it up snapped into to pieces...now you can't blame it on the child because his kicking is not strong enough to do that. Also, his weight was not a factor for this to make this possible in any way! I am disatisfied and i'm angry because what if something more could've happen. As it is when it snapped it made it almost flip over and not only that it made it so that his head was not supported up and it had hit the ground. Please don't buy this for your child, it should be a saftey recall and i'm going to try and make it happen, and if you know anyone who has one please inform them of this matter!"
80318,0,"The mattress is actually great BUT do yourself a favor and buy a 3"" one! The person who posted that the Koala Brand sheets fit this 5"" mattress is completely WRONG!!! They don't fit at all, and I ended up spending the SAME price as the mattress just to get 2 sheets with a 5"" depth from a babybedding dotcom."
15382,1,I loved this swing. The only thing that I could say bothered me was storing it. It was pretty bulky but the swing was comfortable for my baby and put her to sleep with the soothing music. It looks nice with my furniture and served its purpose. Would buy again for another baby.
164185,1,"I don't own this yet, but am going to get one. To the reviewer who said it is a waste of money, you wouldn't say that if you had a child who suffered from it. All babies are different, and for some reason, some babies are more susceptible to flat head than others. When my oldest son was a baby, he had colic really bad. The only time I could get him to sleep was when I put him in his carseat. After time, his poor little head flattened in the back. It never corrected itself, and now, my 11 year old son has a wider and rounder face because of this. Because when the back of the head is flattened, it widens the front of the head, and makes the face wider and rounder. We have a new baby, and I don't have a problem getting him to sleep in his bassinet, but I am going to purchase this for the swing and the carseat. I don't think he will ever be in either one long enough to cause flat head, but I'm not taking any chances."
12712,0,"Tried right up to a week before delivery and never was able to hear either of our babies heartbeats (twins). We could hear them moving around from time to time, but that was about it.The speakers are fun though. Every time my wife would hook them up it would get the babies kicking all over the place. So it was worth it just for that to us, but I suppose if you held a pair of headphones on there it would work just as well."
113727,1,"well ya get what you pay for, it will work out just fine but, my son is 5 1/2 months old and his side muscles aren't totaly as strong as they should be for this seat, he slips side to side and he become uncomfortable in a few minutes. I'm sure it will be just fine in a month or two."
54055,1,"Some reviewers have said that this won't work with leather upholstery, which is what I thought at first, but it does with ours. My husband bought this and it ended up sitting around for a couple of months. Then one day I decided to try it because I was going on a long trip with the baby but without my husband. The center seat of our SUV doesn't have a headrest, and I, too, was worried about the leather. But the back of the seat is actually cloth, so I just pinned it to the cloth and it hangs over the seat. It works perfectly and is positioned so that I can flip my rearview mirror down for a second and see my baby in the mirror perfectly. Now she's sitting on the right rear passenger side in a large convertible seat and I can't see my baby without this. It's hanging over the headrest and I can see her great. She loves looking at herself in the mirror, too. I'm definitely glad we bought it."
541,1,i only by these on sale or thru subscibe and save otherwise not worth the extra more than target store brand
142775,1,This valence and the entire paisley park set are sooo pretty! Of course it matches the set perfectly. I bought 2 so that I could scrunch them up instead of just having it straight across but honestly it looked cute either way I just prefer the scrunched look. I put plain white curtain under them for our daughter's room.
165937,0,this is our third child. We have been using Pampers diapers (same brand). These diapers are much lower quality compared to a few years ago.
183857,1,"I'm not sure if I will need more of these in the future, but for now, this is more than enough! My daughter is just now beginning to be spoon fed so it's still a trial and error. But I absolutely love the set and the amount in it. The only thing that bothered me was that the dye for the orange items came off. I put them into the dishwasher for the first use along with some of her other bottles and the dye washed onto some of the bottles. So, the First Years products still look orange and so do some of the bottles. But the bottles are still usable. So, all in all, this is still a fantastic product!"
52552,0,"Although this is a very cute item , I think Fisher Price needs to do some fine tuning on this product. I am a big fan of the Aquarium line but this swing goes fast even on the lowest setting. My 2 1/2 month old girl is small for her age and the swing goes too fast , also the dangling toys come close to her face every time she swings. This is an ok product but I don't think I would buy this for anyone."
177445,1,"When I registered at Babies R Us, I wasn't sure what pump to choose. I asked the ladies at my breast feeding class what they thought and I got many reccommendations for the Medela and Avent Isis pumps. When I found out that the Medela (electric) pump costs $250, I was worried. That was more than my travel system! So, I decided that I would register for the Avent Isis and if the pump was too slow, I would then look into buying or renting an electric pump. I WAS SO PLEASED!!!! The pump only costs $60. It only took me 20 mins to pump a 9oz bottle... and it didn't hurt a bit! Best of all, I can EXPRESS BREAST MILK ANYWHERE. There's no need for an electric outlet, no batteries to replace, and it's almost silent. My daughter is now six months old and I'm still nursing at home and using the Avent Isis at work. The Avent Isis is the only breast pump I will ever use and I reccommend it to anyone. Who needs one of those expensive, noisy electric pumps?!"
119082,1,"This is really the best nursing pillow on the market. This is the nursing pillow that is recommended by lactation consultants. I can really see why. I really love this one. It has made my breastfeeding experience so pleasurable. This pillow brings baby into the perfect position for nursing. It also fastens around your waist so that the pillow is snug around you and the baby does not roll into the middle of the pillow like with the Boppy. It also has a pocket to keep nursing pads, pacifiers and other small items. The slipcover also washes up really nicely too. This is one of my favorite breastfeeding accessories and I would recommend it to anyone."

153305,1,"I only have to use this sparingly. My mom and mother-in-law are used to using a ton of Vaseline and/or baby powder, so they were both at me for not ""protecting my baby's precious bottom."" My baby class instructor told me baby powder can cause yeast infection and Vaseline prevents the skin from breathing (nothing goes in, nothing comes out). I heard about Butt Paste from a graduate couple and gave it a try. I just put on a thin layer where my baby's butt is a little red and the redness will be gone by the next diaper change.I actually bought this from Walmart (same size). It's HUGE and it's going to last a really long time. You can buy smaller tubes but I thought I'd be paying the same price for less so I might as well get a big jar. I guess it depends on how often your baby's butt gets red. For my baby, it's like once every 1.5 week. Just a dab is enough for him. At this rate, I think I should've gotten the smaller tubes instead. BUT, this is a great deal if your baby's bottom gets red often."
98601,1,"This works perfectly! It is exactly what we wanted. I have no complaints at all. We have a smaller car, and this takes up minimal space. My son (19 months) seems to love it as well."
98973,1,"My son, now two and in the potty training process, is a devoted Pampers wearer. When he was born, Pampers Swaddlers were the only diapers that didn't leak all over everything when he urinated. We tried six or seven different brands, and no matter how often we changed him, all of the others leaked. Pampers did not. He's now moved up the Pampers ranks into a size 5, and we typically use Baby Dry. These work very well for us. We borrowed a Luvs diaper from a friend the other day, and it leaked through his pants within an hour...not cool. We are very loyal Pampers users, and I would highly recommend each line of their diapers (Swaddlers, Swaddlers Sensitive, Baby Dry, Cruisers,etc)."
154412,1,"I really like these wipes, and feel really good using them anywhere on my baby (including hands and face) because as the manufacturer claims ""They are not bleached with chemicals containing chlorine, and don't contain alcohol, fragrance, or synthetic ingredients"" and ""They are moistened with natural aloe vera, vitamin E, and water to cleanse gently and naturally"".I switched from Higgies wipes and was glad I did. I had no idea what kind of chemicals I was exposing my children to.These wipes are between 4-5 stars; it just lost a star because they are not as thick as other wipes but I would give up the thickness anyday in exchange for these ""clean"" wipes!"
32394,0,"The clip is ok, holds well to most fabrics. the loop to tie the clip to the pacifier is hard to use. They added a plastic loop (not in the picture) so that the clip may be used with pacifiers with or without a ""handle"". while this should make the clip more versatile, the two connect-to-pacifier features trip over each other. still, it is sturdily built and lasts."

103534,1,"I don't know why this website only approves it for up to 24 months when an adult can stand on the thing?? Anyway, I got this product because it was getting hard to lift my 2.5 yr old daughter (even though she wieghs less than 24 lbs) to the sink to wash her hands since I am again pregnant. However, she is in the 50th percentile for her age and STILL cannot reach our sinks comfortably with this step stool on the highest level to wash her hands. At least I can put my foot on in and she can sit on my knee, so that does help me out. I had to go buy the wooden 2 step-step stool type thing to get a stool tall enough for her to stand on to wash her hands by herself. To get to the harmful part. If my daughter doesn't stand RIGHT in the middle of this stool, it TIPS OVER and she falls down (last time she hit her head on the toilet and I hurt my back trying to catch her). I can't really store much in it, because she could easily open it. Even washclothes are not fun to pick up off the floor when you are 6 months pregnant.HOWEVER, this stool has made giving her a bath easier as I can sit on it while she takes her bath. I still can't tell whether it's easier on me to sit on it to wash her up or just kneel over, but it's nice to have the option now. The stool also works VERY well at the foot of the toilet so she can climb up easily to sit on the toilet, as well as get off of it easier...and it much sturdier that way.I'd give it a 5 if it the storage compartment stayed shut better (it falls apart when I bring it upstairs for her bath...and I don't want to have to carry it upstairs with 2 hands when I'm already a clumpy pregnant lady...I need one hand on the rail) and if it didn't tip over so easily when you stand on the corner."
471,1,"I used to buy Pampers Cruisers for my son, perhaps thinking if they cost more they must work better. Who knows. Then Cruisers added the Dry Max and my son started getting a rash. Thank goodness, becuase I switched to these diapers and realized they work just as well, are significantly cheaper, and don't have the perfume that caused the rash. Just a note: they do seem to run slightly smaller than Cruisers and Swaddlers when you order the same size."
69307,1,My son is a big boy....40lbs and only 2! The doc said from the very begning we would have problems with diapers and she was right! He is in the 120th percentile for height and 110th for weight! These are the only diapers that fit him and they work great! VERY happy that these are available.
123692,0,"This thing is roomy, sturdy, fun and colorful. My kids both love it. The only issue is my personal concern about the polyurethane foam in the floor of it, which is treated with flame retardants. Having a small babe or toddler mouth toys on the padding (the treated foam is covered with fairly thin polyester), eating on, and crawling all over it is just not something I am comfortable with. I solved this problem by purchasing a BabeSafe cover for the floor (size F fit well. Do NOT order size C, because this is a bigger play yard than the standard Pack n Play). Now it's all good and we are super happy, but those extra $40 I had to shell out to protect my kids from flame retardants took 2 stars off the product. In short, I would really recommend this product, but only if a proper offgassing cover is purchased."
99296,0,"I used to buy pampers from Amazon through the subscribe and save program with free shipping. Amazon switched to Huggies in their subscribe save program and dumped the free shipping. The 252 count of size 1 baby dry is $42.99 at Amazon and $32.99 at Babies-R-Us. Plus Babies-R-Us gives me coupons every month for $10 off when you buy 2 boxes, or $7 off when I buy one box and a box of wipes. I still use Amazon for other things, but not for diapers!!"
90375,1,"We tried just about every brand of diapers when our daughter was born. From Huggies, Target brand, Kirkland brand (Costco), Pampers Swaddlers, Pampers Cruisers, and more! We used the Pampers Cruisers until she was about 6 months old, then we decided to try the Baby Dry. We had heard mixed reviews about the Baby Drys so we were a bit hesitant at first. In all honesty, we were completely surprised. We think the Baby Drys fit her better and absorb just as good as the Cruisers. We have yet to have a blowout with them and we have been using them for about 6 months now! Plus they are cheaper than the cruisers so you end up saving some much needed money every month! We will definitely be using Baby Dry with our next kid!"
170772,0,These are very cheaply made sheets! They DO NOT fit snugly (not even close) &amp; are paper thin. Why didn't Graco make these with elastic sides like a regular crib sheet? I didn't find them to be soft or thick enough to absorb diaper leaks. I purchased the NOJO terry sheets out of frustration with these &amp; they are a much better product.
182917,1,"Gave this gift to my nephew, and his father was sooooo excited. A must have for any guy who is into football."
869,1,"I really like these pampers for my long skinny 13# baby! Iv'e been using them over a month, and they haven't leaked at all. One lasts through the night for my baby.Would recomend getting big pack. You will be able to use them for awhile because of the adjustable size."
134699,2,"I bought this for my 4 month old. First thing, I'm pretty sure that at the store this had said ""minimal assembly required"", yeah right it took me forever! At least 30-45 minutes!! She had a lot of interest in the lion teether thing. She wanted so badly to chew on it but couldn't get it to maneuver on its side to get it into her mouth. Needless to say, she was VERY frustrated!! She liked the circus tent with the music, she was able to spin it very easily as well as the monkey spin barrel. She had no interest in any other toys on the thing, Except the extra ""switcharoo"" crinkle bumble bee we put on it in one of the other toys' place. Also the seat didn't seam to spin very easily either. She would only sit in this thing for about two minutes before crying to get out! Thats when I decided to just exchange it for something else. So, I went to collapse it to put it back in the box. In order to do this, apparently you need to press EXTREMELY hard on these tabs on the bottom of the legs. I finally got it and thats when my thumb nail was ripped half way off (below the skin, way below) wow did that hurt! I'm definetly not getting another exersaucer like this!"
64811,1,"This is the best swing on the market for babies who will sleep nowhere else but the swing. My 13 month old still naps in it, every single day. She naps in it for hours, much longer than she would in the crib, and she falls asleep in there almost instantly. My sanity is tied to this swing.We have a full-size swing in addition to this swing, but it sits up so high that I am afraid she'll fall out. In this swing, she sits less than 2 inches off the ground, so there is absolutely no risk of her falling out and being hurt. Also, it is the only travel swing on the market (that I am aware of) that reclines quite as far back, so even if she leaned forward really far, she wouldn't fall out. I've looked at other travel swings (even the other ones made by F-P), and the seat is nowhere near as deep.I don't mind buying all of those C batteries, they buy me a whopping TWO AND A HALF HOURS of nap time every day. Life is good."

106324,0,"I received the Diaper Champ as a gift when my baby girl was born last year. At first it seemed as the perfect way to keep diaper smells away; it worked like a charm. Within four to five months it started to smell, it did not seal properly and the smell got impregnated on the plastic, it was impossible to get rid of it. I tried to wash it, spray it, scrub it, but nothing. Maybe the sealing system fades with use. I used it till I couldn't anymore and two months ago bought the Diaper Genie. Yes, you have to buy refils ... it does a great job a sealing smells."
155714,1,"This does work - the design is neat, it holds a decent amount of water, and it attaches to the crate firmly. However, my 5 month old puppy chewed it up his first time alone in his crate. It would be great for older dogs past the ""chew everything!"" stage, though. If it were metal, I'd buy another based on the design and would've given it 5 stars..."
129253,1,"My two month is just beginning to hold things. This has many places he can hold on to so it's easier to get a grip. He's not very good at holding on to things for very long, but he seems to be happy with this so far!"
28847,0,"The Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman Set is a great chair for nursing a newborn or infant, or for rocking said newborn or infant to sleep. The assembly is relatively simple (took about 20 minutes). The chair is very comfortable and looks nice (doesn't look cheap). The only problem that I've encountered is:There are four springs that run under the seat cushion from the back to the front of the chair. These spring are attached to the wood frame by having the ends of the springs inserted downward into vertical holes in the wood. I weigh 190 pounds and if I sit down quickly (plop down into the chair), the springs occasionally will pop out and they are very tricky to get back in. As you put one end of the spring back into its hole, the other ends want to pop out. I solve this, of course, by not ""plopping down"" into the seat any more, but it still seems like the springs could be set into the frame more securely.I would give this chair 3.5 stars if I could, but I figure that there are people heavier than I that may be interested in this chair, and they may find the springs popping out on them more often. I still love this chair, I just need to ease my way into its comfort."
130689,0,"For the most part the swing is good. My daughter likes it, when it works. We have had to replace the motor housing 3 times. It's frustrating because we have spent the money on an item that doesn't work, and we have to keep waiting to recieve the part. I have heard this has happened to others as well."
15499,1,"I bought this gate because it is the ONLY gate I could find to fit our very large opening since we have an open floor plan in our ranch house. It's great! The only complaint is that if you don't screw into a stud, you will DEFINITELY need to get your own drywall screws and (sorry I'm not sure what they're called...), but the plastic pieces you put in before the screws. Also, because I have it strait across an area instead of in a corner, it is less stable...meaning when my daughter pushes on it, the gate tends to go forward a bit since the ""feet"" by the door of the gate are not screwed to the floor! You can't really do anything about it since it's such a wide opening. Not a big deal for me. Holding up great for a few months now. The gate also looks really nice."
1847,1,"Until Pampers recently added the Flex-waistband, I was almost ready to give up on them as my 9-month-old kept leaking in his diapers at night. But since they've added it, NO LEAKS!!! Plus not much ""jello"" stuff rubbing off on him. I love the security of knowing that he won't wake up wet and uncomfortable."

101792,1,Finally a crib pad that works! I've scoured the stores for something that my little 14-month old boy can't pull off his crib mattress. And this one does it. The elastic band is great for snapping underneath the mattress. Gives me the peace of mind I need about this staying in place.
45953,1,"My son adores his mobile. He chats with it pretty much every night and every morning. Honestly, it is very simple and I am amazed that he likes it so much. I would not have purchased it unless a friend had recommended it so highly. And I am so glad I listened to her! The simple shapes and colors are apparently very appealing and engaging, judging from how much my son loves to chat it up.Okay, yes, this mobile is not made out of the most durable materials (as other reviewers have noted). I don't find this to be a problem, however, because I don't want my kid to touch it! A crib mobile should be out of reach of babies. I just use some care when changing the cards and have not had any problems with them tearing."
102229,1,"I can't say enough about how much I love my snap and go - now that the twins are almost a year old and outgrowing thier infant car seats I am so sad to part with it. I absolutely LOVED this thing! I could fit almost a whole grocery run in the basket, it weighs WAY less than my big Graco duoglider, and it fits in the trunk of my Grand Am with plenty of room for groceries, etc. If you are thinking about it - just buy it! You will not regret it and it will save you time and space - things moms of twins are always short of!"
8883,1,"This gate us a lifesaver. Not only do I pets, I have a very adventurus toddler. This gate is sturdy and very durable. It is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight. My living room has a curve to it so it fits great. A wonderful item. Thank you!"
169046,2,"I have two sons. One has sensitive skin. The other does not. For the boy with sensitive skin, Pampers Swaddlers caused horrible diaper rashes. I was using diaper cream religiouly on him with no effect. I went to his peditrician and made sure he did not have yeast diaper rash. I ramped up the diaper cream from the regular strength blue Desitine to the maximum strength purple Desitine. His condition did not improve. I never thought it was the Swaddlers because these diapers felt so soft and nice. For a few days, we ran out of the Swaddlers, so I started using the Costco diapers. His condition improved but I did not associate this improvement with the diaper switch. Once I bought new Swaddlers, his stubborn diaper rash came back. I still did not associate his condition with the Swaddlers. At this time, I received some coupons for Huggies and bought a box of Huggies diaper. After finding out that Huggies Size 3 is smaller than Pampers Swaddlers Size 3, I decided to use Huggies first. His diaper rashes disappeared very quickly again. This time, I finally realized that the Swaddlers diapers were the culprit. Is it the fragrance or something else in the diapers? I don't know. But my son is certainly allergic to something in it.Obviously, not all babies are allergic to Swaddlers. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, her child was allergic only to the Swaddlers but not other diapers made by Pampers. If you child has stubborn diaper rashes that do not respond to regular diaper cream use and you have eliminated other causes such as yeast, you need to switch the diaper he/she is using and see whether that makes a difference."
56892,1,easy to install and easy to use.I would recommend this to any one looking for a gate.would purchase again
23299,0,"The item is OK as an organizer. I used it with Medela bags, it fits about 10 of those if the bags are nicely flattened), so it's good if you need only few stashed. However at BabiesRUs it costs $16.99, whereas at the time of a review Amazon offers it for $23.75 on sale(!). Considering additional shipping cost, the difference definitely is not worth the convenience of a front door delivery..Also, if you are building a bigger stash, this organizer makes no sense, it takes too much room in the freezer, easier to use 1g freezer bags. Not as neat, but more practical.Not suitable for Lansinoh bags."
94037,1,"This is the one you want to take if you have severe symptoms of a UTI coming on. Mine was so bad that I ended up in the ER two nights in a row. The first night was for the extreme pain, pressure and v-bleeding. The second night was for a spiked fever and chills, BUT my severe pain, pressure and bleeding had all improved from the previous day since I started taking this product... in fact they took another urine sample that showed up clear, with NO sign of a UTI! I chose to continue with the antibiotics that were prescribed just to be sure this time around. But I am going to keep this product on hand as a preventative if there is a next time. It's fascinating to learn how the Mannose helps to lure the E. Coli bacteria away from your urinary tract, causing it to expel out with your urine... to read about this more in detail do a search of a blog entitled; Mannose + Botanicals: A One-Two Punch Against UTIs. I'm NOT a rep for this product, I'm just more than happy to spread the word when I find something that really works! Take care."

Needless to say we are returning this useless product."

However when I tried it, I found it didn't fit my tub type (oval). Being that my son is over 15 lbs. and with the tendonitis in my wrists, I was finally able to enjoy bathtime w/ my son (in a non-oval type tub). Also read the instructions for depth requirements. Oh well, I'll just take it over to my mom's for her use, it'll fit her tub."

Usually I give things the benefit of the doubt, because there are a lot of incompetent people out there (no offense), however there were enough bad reviews on this tub to sway me to my decision. A great idea, but maybe they need to work on the design. Good luck to all and congratulations to new parents."
164150,1,"My first son had plagiocephaly (distortion/flat spots of the head) and we had to go through the Starband (helmet) therapy which cost us approximately $3000.00 and 8 months of treatment. Our insurance did not cover it - ouch! My second son was showing signs of plagiocephaly and we scheduled a consultation with our therapist. They recommended we use this pillow along with a sleep positioning pillow for a month and come back for a follow up to see if we would need treatment. Our follow up appointment is this Tuesday and we'll find out how successful we were, but using the naked eye our son's head looks much better. I will update this review after we get the verdict from our upcoming appointment!"
154911,1,"We are thrilled with this chair. It was a reasonable price, is very sturdy, and looks nice. We have used it with our daughter from age 6 months- which the manufacturer does not recommend- but it has worked beautifully for us.We will definitely buy another one for the next child."

I did notice that during the first day of it being in her crib the motor became louder and louder until it started squeeking.

I have been searching high and low for breast milk trays. When I received it, my SO was very disappointed that the slots in the trays were not breast-shaped. Buyer beware: just because it says breast milk trays, doesn't mean it's breast shaped. Oh well, I'll just have to keep looking."
179236,1,Although these bottles can be a pain to wash because all of the pieces they are the ones that my baby loves the best. The slow flow nipples are still the only ones that she will use at 4 months without choking. We take all the pieces apart and clean them in the dishwasher. We have a few leak but they usually weren't all the way dry yet or the bottom was screwed on way to tightly.
141783,1,I have a 2yr old and 7mo old and they both like to play with it. 7mo old can sit and 'attack' it. The wheels lock so it won't go backwards when he pushes it and my 2yr old likes to push it all over the house and sing with the music and talking on its phone.
9580,1,"I have this for my almost 3 year old son who is around 30lbs and very tall. He loves this seat. He fits in it just fine, we have had no trouble with leaks, and he finds it very easy to use on his own. The potty is very easy to clean, and we have never had a problem with pee getting everywhere. The one thing I would change is that sometimes the removable seat does get stuck to his thighs when he stands, but he's learned to be careful, and we've never had an accident due to that. Otherwise, great potty training seat!"

18166,1,"If you buy your child one toy, make it this activity gym. We've used this gym since our son was three weeks old. (before that, it made a great cat toy) It really helped settle him down when he was feeling colicky. Now at 2 months, he breaks into a big gummy grin and laughs every time he sees the musical, lighted sun. He just started grabbing the hanging red bird and ladybug. It's also a great place to put him for &quot;tummy time&quot;. He pushes himself up to look at all the colorful accessories, especially the mirror."
49014,1,"We love this gate. We have twins and take it to the in-law's home because they are not child proofed and have a wood stove to keep babies away from. also we use it out on our deck, in the yard, and when we were replacing our carpets with wood flooring. we have the octagonal gate because we bought the extensions. the gate broke twice, once when I tripped and fell on it over a large toy and snapped it between me and the toy, and once we left it outside in a windstorm and it blew off our deck into the neighbors yard which is a downhill drop. we got the gate when they were under a year old and now they are almost 2 and we still use it. it's big enough with the extension that we can all get in there to play, and in the yard they have fun in there but stay out of the road (we are a corner lot with no fence.) We have also used it as a room divider. if you have a slippery floor (wood, linoleum) just put it on top of a big blanket or some of those foam puzzle mats. it works great and won't scoot. It took us several months to finish our floors and this was so helpful because they could watch us work on the floor on one side of the room while they played right there in sight. One reviewer stated he wanted to set it up into a square, which is a bad idea: it is not structurally as stable as a square (if you buy the two panel extension, which I highly recommend) because the middle joints of the square shape don't have leverage when flat like they do when bent out. even a slight bend in the joint makes a huge difference. this is really a big play space, my husband and I are both tall and we can both get in there with the kids and play with them one on one with toys and when we have them in there alone it's really enough space they don't care unless of course, they would rather be out doing what we are doing. But when you need a safe space to put little ones in while you are doing something else, this has really been a great solution for us, I'm so glad I bought it."

112097,0,Quality of this product is not up to the mark.but better than other products
128352,2,"I just bought the Dora folding potty seat today at Walmart. It doesn't cover the entire toilet seat. It starts at the front of the toilet, and doesn't go all the way to the back. The result is that there is no support in the back. My daughter is 3 yrs, 4 months, and this seat is much too weak for her. Any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back. I'm afraid that if we use it, it will soon break and she'll fall in. She definitely can't sit back, or even sit straight up because it sinks so much. I'm returning it and I'm going to look for something else."
180706,0,"The stroller is great, and rides very smooth. There is just one thing that really irritates me to death about it; the back wheel locks were very poorly designed. I will try my best to explain the design - the piece that locks the back wheels from moving is a bar that you push up or down - when the bar is down, the wheels are locked and the stroller does not move (this part works fine) - when the bar is up, the lock is released and the stroller is suppose to move freely, however, the bar does not stay in the ""up"" position and tends to creep back down causing the locking piece and the wheels to hit each other - this makes an annoying thumping sound and can't be good for the system."
175252,1,We just started our baby on cereal and found that these bowls were the perfect size for small feedings. We also use them for small amounts of 'supported sitter foods' I love the fact they come with lids. And can see that we will also be able to use them to take snacks with us as she grows.
118569,1,"What better way to include your young'un in family meals than to pull them up to the table, grind exactly what you're eating and let them join in the family atmosphere eating. Not to mention fresher, healthier and less costly meals with no fillers."
79310,1,"We purchased the Zanzibar set when my son was born and loved everything about it. My son is now 2 and everyday we have to name all of the animals on his rug, quilt, wall hangings etc so it has been educational as well. He loves animals and I think his room has had alot to do with this.The quality of the fabric is excellent and washes well too. If you don't fancy blue or bright colours, this is the set for you. I don't think I will change his room for at least another 2 years as I don't think its babyish at all. I also can't see him wanting to change his room either."
112663,1,"As a mom of 5 Boys, I offer my experience with disposable diapers.I imagine myself having to wear diapers all the time and look for the best fit which I feel equals the best comfort. I have found that a great fit PLUS often changes equals no or minimal leaks.In order to achieve a great fit you need to start with the correct size. I have found that the numbers on the box mean nothing! YOur babies height and frame size really determine which size your baby needs. It is usually a lot of trial and error but I have always purchased the next size well before my babies were actually the weight stated on the packaging.Sagging, that is, when the crotch hangs down makes for a very uncomfortable diaper. Huggies supremes have the elastic in the back of the diaper which tends to hold the diaper up better, but I have discovered that there is so much padding between the legs that this style simply does not work for boys.The wide stretchy sides that pampers cruisers have make achieving a perfect fit very easy! Although, sometimes I have to roll the back of the diaper back a bit to get that perfect fit. If pampers had a little bit of elastic in the back, they woudl be perfect! Also, the padding inside is trimmer in the crotch area making it not as bulky.I also love the new woven liner. It is very soft. I don't know if it serves any other purpose but I feel better putting someithing soft and somewhat airy on my little baby.I have tried Pampers Baby Dry, Huggies Baby Shaped and Supreme, Luvs, Walmart's Brand, and CVS premium. I am all about saving money where I can but I also want baby to be comfortable.I have found all disposable diapers to be pretty much the same and no matter what brand you use, they all serve their purpose. With all the different types I have tried, I have never disliked any one enough to not use the entire pack. In fact, if I go to purchase diapers and there is an irrestible sale on another brand, I will purchase them and only buy a small pack of cruisers. I mix them up in our changing area and end up using both types. Sometimes I have three and four varieties mixed in there.I do have to admit, the Pampers Cruisers are my first choice and always the ones I am reaching for first. I like the way they smell and especially the way they fit, even more now that Luca is up and Cruising around. They are the only ones I have found to not sag and shift with our toddler's many busy antics and movements.Hope this helps!Rosemary Bertinelli"

74240,0,"My husband and I have been trying so hard to find the perfect double stroller to accommodate our 2 year old and our baby on the way. While this stroller is very convenient: (holds both children as well as an infant car seat), it lacked some luster in other areas. 1. It was just as easy to collapse as any other double stroller travel system. 2. The front seat did not recline as far as it should for an infant. 3. The material was very durable but was not removable for washing. 4. No cup tray or organizer for those parents who want a place for everything. 5. I'm very petite and this stroller was as heavy as the other Graco double strollers.*Bottom line: If you are looking for a double stroller a travel system just seemed to be the way to go and also available for the same price."
85691,1,"I bought this changing table as a less expensive alternative to what my sister in law had on her baby registry. After reading really good reviews on it, I purchased it, and my sis in law told me it looks beautiful in her daughter's room, and was easy to put together. I saved $30 on this one, and it had better reviews than the one my sister had put on her registry."
69203,2,I love Pampers Cruisers and ordered some a few weeks ago when the price was low. I STILL haven't recieved the diapers! It's taking forever! I checked back and I can't believe the price increase. I won't be buying these here anymore...WalMart it is!
122069,2,"We tried a bunch of these carriers, not wanting to spend a lot on a baby bjorn, but ended up returning all of them. This one was cumbersome to put on and get baby in and out. I also found it uncomfortable. The baby bjorn is expensive, but has been well worth it. I wish I just purchased it from the start."
2082,1,"Love, love, love this product!! its the best, i've tried all kinds of different diapers, none can beat it!! :) love pampers!!"
103899,1,I've had the Ameda breastpump for 7 years. This is the second time that I need to replace a part and I am impressed of how easy it is to find them on line. I really recommend this machine.
66722,1,"I think this is a great stroller for the price. I run with my 2 year old 3 times a week in Prospect Park and it does us just fine. The seat does not sit all the way upright, but he still can see and look around well enough to call out everything he sees. If you're running, lock the front wheel and you may need to adjust it a bit to stop it from veering one way or another. The directions included are a bit vague and I found the trays useless, but that wasn't a deal breaker for us. It folds easily, but it's not all that compact when folded. This may not be as nice as some of the more expensive strollers, but for a dedicated jogging stroller, it's well worth the price."
45528,1,"I bought it as a present, I called my friend and she really liked it. She said that was a very good quality and safe entertaining toy."
121568,0,I agree with another reviewer that the foot pedal doesn't lift the lid up very well and if you don't snap the lid back on correctly (or put it back on backwards) of course it won't work. The foot pedal is also really tucked into the bin so you can't step on it if you're wearing chunky slippers like I do in the cold weather. It's a very basic bin and I use a plastic trash liner I got in bulk [...]. Right now I am using disposable diapers and I can't smell anything around the bin unless I open it.
8947,1,Can any diaper bag really be manly? Well this one comes pretty close without going over the top with say skulls and flames on it. Good amount of storage and fairly user friendly. Changing pad it comes with is a bit flimsy but I just toss in a waterproof pad in there to use with it. Wipes container is a good feature too. Wife sometimes grabs mine over her larger Coach diaper bag. (Which may not be that good of a thing as I shelled out some serious cash for it for her lol)
99609,1,I have found that you can't beat Amazons Pampers prices and the best thing is that they show up on my door step often in less than a week!!!!!!!! No tax and no shipping.I buy all of my diapers from Amazon. The only down side is that I haven't figured out if or how to use manufactures coupons on Amazon's site for even greater savings but the deals are as good as it gets.
104126,1,"This is the one blanket you'll ever need. We have plain blankets and books on swaddling, as well as a few of the other brand name swaddling blankets. But the miracle blanket is foolproof. If your baby breaks out of every other manufactrued blanket like ours does, you should try this blanket."
108778,1,"First, I should tell you that I'm a shampoo junkie. My son has 6 different types of shampoo already.. at 4 months old. I love being able to switch up scents & etcetera. Well, about a month ago he started getting cradle cap, I searched, found this.. and bought it. I don't usually pay much attention to the reviews but for some reason I did this time, and I'm glad! His cradle cap was gone in 1 wash, and out of all of his shampoo's .. his hair has never felt like it had been conditioned as well. This leaves his hair sooo soft and smelling fresh. It really is worth every penny, and it will last forever I can tell. If you don't want to deal with cradle cap, do yourself a favor and just buy a bottle. Trust me, you won't regret it! I personally think it smells kind of like gardenia, or a flower.Way to go Mustela :)"

This Pack n Play was perfect for him to sleep in while they were here. The price was perfect and the quality is excellent. Very happy with this purchase."
106933,1,"THIS IS A GREAT GIFT THAT ANY NEW MOTHER WOULD LOVE; NO BUYING SPECIAL TRASH BAGS, SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN A CORNER AND BEST OF ALL NO SMELLING UP THE HOUSE. MY HUSBAND WHO IS NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF CHANGING SOILED DIAPERS DOESN'T COMPLAIN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW TO USE THIS BABY ITEM."
71964,1,"I was looking for the new version car seat that allows up to 30lbs.With the new law about rear facing until one year I wanted to make sure I only had to purchase one until I purchase the bigger foward facing carseat. This one is perfect, I bought it for my grandson, my Daughter loves the color scheme. It is black and silver mostly with a tiny bit of blue. Love the new harness closure system (bigger buttons)."
106861,0,"We bought the diaper champ, because we heard all the others where over priced, espeically with the refills. We liked how with the this diaper pail you could just use regular trash bags. It worked very well and we where very happy with our purchase until it started to get warmer out, and our son started to eat foods. It smells! We keep it in our son's closet with an air freshiner in it! It's good while they are young, right now i think any trash can would do the same."
89451,2,"I bought pampers baby dry for my new born. An absolute waste of money. Used only a few and i already hate them. Leaks, and becomes a wet cottony ball,and does not fit right will not suggest this to a friend! And will not use then ever!!! I have the entire box just sitting and collecting dust!"
142383,2,The engineering on this product is a disgrace. The instructions for assembly are incomplete and the the parts are not lableled or marked as they should be. When we called the customer service number they were vague and unhelpful.I suggest you reconsider buying this product. My entire experience was awful.
28723,1,My step mom bought this for me from my registry when I gave birth 2 weeks ago. It was sooooo easy to put together. The ottoman is already in tact. The pads are comfortable. I fall asleep in this chair often when breastfeeding my son on his boppy... I love it!!!!
76816,2,"The fabric and stitching around the mirror is fine. Well constructed. It's the mirror itself that is the problem. It's a plastic faux-mirror material that doesn't reflect in a linear fashion the way a glass mirror does. Akin to a fun house mirror - not quite as bad, but enough to warp your face and surroundings, give you a head ache and make you feel a bit nuts while looking at it.I would never let a child (baby) of mine look at him or herself in this mirror. It may induce autism or some other psychological disorder. Crazy baby syndrome. I feel it's important for a baby to see an unwarped reflection at this stage of development.There are other plastic mirrors on the market that reflect much better than this one."
69170,1,"We have used pampers cruisers for both of our girls and they have the best price/performance ratio of any we have found. Amazon's free shipping is a plus, since it is a bear to go out in the winter sometimes for a diaper run."
115387,1,My daughter loves Dora so I bought this one for her. It is nice one but the little thing on the front for boys could not been removed. I am really careful to get her off the seat after each time use. And it seems does not bother her. Still use it and like it.
128042,0,"Got this stroller mostly for inside (mall) use. Love the weight, the easy open and close, the extended visor/cover, and the look of it. Sometimes it won't turn properly, though; and there is really not much use for the basket underneath. When baby was small, head rest was awesome!"
49703,0,"This is such a cute and (so far) durable little stool and it is great for the potty but my son (2 years)still can't reach the sink with it. If your little one just needs a little boost,or if like us, you have a small bathroomthis stool is great and easy to stash out of the way."
53662,1,"I want to start by saying that these chairs can go for $35 and up to $80! So, to get it for $18 is a steal!This thing is amazing! It's perfect! It exceeded my expectations!I didn't buy this to use with my own table BUT it has a 4in lip around it, and it would still work if I needed it to. It clips to my kitchen bar, and it clips to my husband's desk! (He has one of those heavy, solid wood desks it takes two men to lift)I bought this SOLELY to use in booths in restaurants. I have friends whose babies were in the restaurant high chair and got a hot plate food spilled on them by a waiter, and another had a patron bump into their kid because they weren't watching where then are going, so I do NOT want my kid in rickety old wooden high chair, in the narrow aisle of a dimly lit public place. This is not my idea of safe. I'd MUCH rather her be IN the booth between me and my husband, or me and the wall, depending on the size of the booth and how many people we are dining out with.Is is PERFECT! It only takes up just enough space, AND there is plenty of room, and it has a 5pt harness! My baby is 22.5 lbs and 2.5 feet tall, and it very comfortable, with room to spare. She sits unassisted, and does NOT slip around.And the seat cushion is removable by velcro, so you can wash it! Love it! That was a pleasant surprise!I just love it! I just wish I'd bought it sooner, and if it doesn't last til the next kid, I'll buy this same exact one again.***About the reviews that say it doesn't fit, they are wrong! When you put it on the counter, table, etc. it won't be flush. It will lean forward a great deal. Once you fold the arms up and TIGHTEN THE ARMS it will slowly become flush with the table and be locked in. I know it seems like it won't fit, but I promise it does! You just have to tighten the arms. I'll post pics to show what I mean."
134048,2,"by the time you take the wipe out to the baby's skin, the wipe is already cold."
32030,1,This is a wonderful and great looking bed. My 2-year-old daughter just loves it. As far as the comment about a child getting stuck under it??????? My daughter couldn't even begin to fit unless she forced herself and she is very tiny for 2 and besides that the bed is so light she herself can move it and pick up the one end. I really do not see how it would take two people top pick it up???????
21562,0,"My mother-in-law, who watches my daughter, bought a sensory bouncer to keep at her house. I was excited to get one for our home because of the sensory options she would have. She especially liked the crinkly fabric on the bee's wings and on the swing arms that hold the bee and the bear. When I received the bouncer, many of the fabric items had been changed, and not in a good way. The same crinkly fabric wasn't used, and I found out after speaking with FP, is no longer used. To me, the ""sensory"" was taken out of the bouncer. There is still different fabric, but it's really not the same as the product they once put out (like the one my mother-in-law bought at a children's consignment shop.) My daughter still uses it, but doesn't show as much interest in the non-crinkly winged bee."

23536,1,I throw some of these in my bag whenever we travel. Great for after using a portapotty or if your hands are sticky after a snack or before having a snack on the trail.
129485,1,Perfect for little hands to grip around. Very colorful and has a little rattle in the middle. My daughter loves it - and she is only 5 months old. Very easy for her to use.
130042,1,"DaVinci cribs are nice wood cribs that convert to a full (or twin) bed. But to convert, you need the Conversion Rail Kit. We converted our Emily crib, the full bed is a nice piece of furniture for our child. We had no need for the toddler bed / crib anymore. The full bed doesn't look like a manipulated former crib. The Conversion Rail Kit seems like it's an original part of the full bed. So this Conversion Kit is a 'must have' item if you own one of the DaVinci convertible cribs and want to get the max mileage out of it, especially when you have matching dressers."
129284,1,"This is a great toy for newborns. It is flexible, durable, and chewable. It helps baby improve motor skills. It is brightly colored so it is appealing to baby."
144167,1,"My 3 month old had a hard time in the car until recently. Once she was able to focus on the colorful side of this playmat, she was occupied during car rides and no longer cried. Now, as soon as I put her in her carseat, she immediatley fixates on the mat and is quiet for our entire journey."
124852,2,These outlet covers are a complete waste of money. They are perfectly designed for little fingers to pull out. My daughter has an easier time pulling these out than my husband and the tab sticks out in a way that makes pulling it out tempting for her. Bare outlets would be safer.
52577,0,The main complaint is that it sits up to high and my twins(one in it at a time) end up leaning over to the side. Other than that I really like it. They really like the lights and enjoy the music.

93086,0,"Purchased the same product (same part number) a few months ago.Wanted a 2nd, as 2 grand children are able to use them at the same time.The newer bed is less sturdy, appears to be lighter construction and a less satisfactory carrying bag with no shoulder strap as the first one had.Am disappointed I did not receive the same product as the original."
1772,1,"Love Pampers. I've tried Huggies Natural, Kirkland brand, and Huggies regular; nothing beats Pampers. They fit really well. I haven't had blowouts (except when she was in the smaller ones and needed to move up a size). These hold really well, are soft, and fit well. One area for improvement: they smell and need to be aired out. I have a sensitivity to smell, though. But, most disposable diapers have a yucky smell."
161672,2,"this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up. couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily - i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it. also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this. preferred the euortub by far!"
63263,1,"I was debating between this and the stokke and some other fancy adjustable high chairs. I like that it looks like our regular furniture and will look nice for a long time, since everything for babies is plastic, I wanted to avoid that for the dining room. I really like the high chair. I'd use a different alan wrench as the one it comes with will strip the bolts over time. But I like the chair very much. Kettler makes nicely designed well thought out products."
17455,1,"I think that the Galt Playnest &amp; Gym is a great product for all babies. At first you can just use the ring, and the baby explores the textures and sounds, but then put the gym on and it keeps him amused for hours.I'll definitely use it for my next one"
98103,1,"We love these bottles. We started out with different bottles by Avent, but quickly changed to these. Our baby breastfeeds and uses these bottles, and she has no problem switching between them. The curved bottle helps her not to get air bubbles, so she doesn't spit up as much. Also, you can interchange different styles of Platex nipples based off what your baby likes (soft or hard). I would recommend these bottles to anyone."
38199,0,"I didn't know that this swing had a timer on it. It has 8, 15, and 30 minutes and even if you don't chose any of those it still shuts off after 45 minutes, which then causes my son to wake up again. After he wakes up for his middle of the night feeding the only way to put him back to sleep is a swing. He also takes a big nap for about four hours during the day. I have the fisher price papasan swing and he sleeps in that for hours and hours at a tim. My parents decided to buy this swing to take less room but he does not like this swing at all. Even when I do manage to get him to sleep in it, he wakes up after the swing automatically stops. I also think another reason he doesn't sleep well in it is that its very exposed. It doesn't cuddle him in. He's even preffered to sleep in his car seat over the swing. Honestly I wish my parents would have never wasted their money on this swing, but maybe I can figure out a way to make him feel more cuddled in this swing. The one huge plus for this swing is that it is practically silent."
147294,2,"I was soooo disappointed! I absolutely loved this fabric and drooled over this playpen for months before I was finally able to buy it. Out of all my children, this was the first fabric for a child's item I had truly loved. This is my 5th child, over 15 years, so I have had lots of playpens. It seems like we purchased a new one for each child. I know how to operate them, even the challenging ones. This one was not hard, it was broken; no question about it! When the center is pulled up, we could easily pull up one of the sides but the other latch on the other side would not hold together. I read that other people had the same issue and to save the box so I did, just in case. They were right.Another concern; the bassinet was a little awkward and cheap looking. The fabric projects a quality appeal but the parts and pieces don't follow suit.Finally, there was what looked like a paint spot on one corner. It wasn't external though, it was as if it had received the spot while in manufacturing because it was within the plastic. It was just one more thing that demonstrated poor quality.In conclusion, I'm returning the playpen and going to try a different one. While the fabric is beautiful the quality of the playpen simply isn't there."
41968,1,"These are great, I prefer Playtex nursers , BUT these are good ,too. Every baby is different and I am glad to have both brands"
119868,1,I had this basinet for my baby and then lend it to a friend and we both loved it. It's made of solid materials not like other bassinets that were flimsy fabric over metal tubes. The bassinet part is solid &quot;cardboard&quot; but not cardboard like you would normally think of cardboad and its not made in a bad way. It makes it really sturdy. I think the other lady who gave the bad review didn't read the instructions or understand the product. You convert the stand of the bassinet to a nice sized toy box. You dont use the bassinet itself as a toy box!!! LIke I said I used this bassinet and then the toy box and then put it back as a bassinet for a friend to use it and it worked great for us. GREAT price too! The bedding set is also nice and you can machine wash.
4635,2,"I have used these on my 4 1/2 month old at night since he was first born (I use cloth during the day) & have always been very happy with them - until I purchased the ""new & improved"" fit - they may be slimmer & smaller but there are nowhere near as absorbent as the previous model. I stupidly bought a case of four - & now I'm stuck with diapers that just don't work for my son! I am going to try to get my money back for these - don't waste yours on them!!I have switched to the Tender Care brand & they seem to work very well."
118097,1,"We got a great deal on this at that major toy chain after Christmas (gift cards, coupons, sale, etc)... We finally set it up recently as our 2 year old son was getting out of his crib at will anyway.Bed assembled very quickly and easily, and he loves it... he actually asks to go lay down in his ""race car bed""!I think it is overpriced for what is basically 5 pieces of molded plastic and some fiberboard. What made it worthwhile for us (besides the deal we got), was that it is convertible from a toddler bed to a twin bed."
184176,1,"I've been using these straps for a year and a half now and love having them! I've used them with three different stroller and have had great success. There is a difference on how the stroller will hang depending on the type. Don't think that a full sized stroller will hang like an umbrella (common sense).With the Inglesina and the McClaren, the straps fit all the way around the stroller holding it up. With my Bob Revolution (2013), I had to adjust. I just loop the stroller straps through the push handle bar and the foot/brake bar (when folded). I don't have to take off the wheels or anything. This keeps my stroller up so I can still use the floor of the trunk for groceries and what nots. Just lifting the strollers off the floor make the trunk much more usable."
65271,1,A great addition to our Phil and Ted stroller. I would highly recommend this attachment!
96051,1,"I bought a tub just like this off of Babycenter last year with the ducky pattern. As soon as my son outgrew his Safer Bather (ie, could sit up reliably), we put him in this tub for baths. I tried one of those hard blue shaped tubs that my neighbor gave to me...he wiggled around and I had to use at least one hand to keep him in the tub. This one is great. He can sit in it and play with his toys easily. It's inflatable so most likely a slip will land the child on air, not porcelain. I was worried about teeth puncturing the tub, but even though he's up to 14 teeth, we still have no puctures. This tub is comfy enough to make bathtime fun but also saves water over using the full-size bathtub. Another HUGE plus, in between kids or for travel, this can be deflated and stored easliy. I would HIGHLY recommend this tub to anyone whose child can sit up, and the Safer Bather product for newborns."
110082,0,"I love this cute plastic diaper toolbox, but the drawers can slide out on either side if you're not careful. A bit pricey too!"
158978,0,I love this plate and the many others like it I have. . . but they are made out of Melamine. Isn't that the same chemical that was found in baby forumla. Why is this ok?
31613,1,"I'm not going to lie, these do occasionally leak, mostly when overfilled or when the top isn't properly screwed on, but that said they are still great cups, and one of the only affordable and BPA Free sippy cup options I have found. BPA Free is much more important to me than a few leaks, and I would totally recommend this to anyone."
78446,1,"I simply love this blanket! It washes well, is nice and thick, and is great for wrapping up my baby girl. She's almost 4 months old and I can still semi-swaddle her in this blanket.I just wanted to update this review. My daughter is now 19 months old and this blanket has become her lovie. She sleeps with it every day and night and sucks on it. It still looks great despite being washed at least once a week (sometimes several times a week)."
108405,1,I just pulled it out and we pasted the foam stickers on the bottom (to prevent sliding). Within minutes she went potty after sitting on it. SO far so good. Now I need a step stool....
67546,1,I love this seat! It is so light weight so it is easily transfered from different vehicles. My son thinks he's such a big boy b/c he can undo the seatbeat. The seat is also very easy to clean. My husband and I are actually going to buy another one so he can just leave it in his truck.
86260,0,"This is a fine item,unfortunatley it picked up the neighbors signal as well as the babys romm. We had to replace it with the newer digital model that the company rep said would not pick up or allow others to pick up your camera."
62686,0,The Diaper Genie is okay. It is easy to use but hard to empty. My husband has to do it because the cutter is hard to press down. I only put wet diapers in it becuase I couldn't stand the odor of the poopy ones. We wrap those up in a plastic bag and put them out to the trash immediately. I guess I wasn't paying attention when I registered because all I ever heard about was a Diaper Genie. If I would have looked and read the reviews I think I would have went for the Diaper Champ.
107549,1,I bought this bottle to help wean my daughter off of her bottle. My idea was to give her this as a bottle for 2-3 weeks and then switch the nipple to the sipee nipple...thus weaning her! It worked! YAY!! She only noticed the difference in nipples for a second but didn't suspect anything because it was the same bottle. Has worked for a week so far and she still thinks its her bottle.
150325,1,Thi is a basic item and not too many features. I have used it for over a year with my first and now my second. Never had a problem and certainly worth the money.
100977,1,"I have been using pamper product since my son was born. Never failed, never leaked, almost performed best.Now my son is 1 year old and still planned to use Pampers for a long time."
118975,2,I had to return the item because it was defective and the replacement came with missing parts. I was given a mere partial refund but I will think it twice before ordering again through Amazon.
133497,1,"We switched to this bottle system when our daughter was 6 months. I wish we had done it sooner. We tried many bottle systems including, Playtex Airvent, MAM Anti Gas, Advent and several others. We had settled on the Advent. This is a good system, just not for our girl. She was still spitting up a lot at six months and we had to keep buying faster and faster nipples, until at four or five months she was using the variable flow thick liquid nipple and quickly these were not fast enough. She would tire out and finish only about half her bottle. The Born Free with the #3 nipple work very well, with in a week she was finishing bottles and the spit up went down to almost nothing. Part of the reflux decrease may have been her age, but I believe the bottles help quite a bit. The Born Free nipples are very soft and the #3 is very fast. The combination is great for our little girl. She is a very happy little girl using these bottles. The quality is very good. The measurements are off a little, as are many bottles. The UK measurements seem to closer to US ounces according to my measuring cup, so I use the UK measurements. Neither seems to be off by that much, so it probably makes no big difference either way."
73308,1,"I purchased this timer a week after my baby was born. It took a little bit of time to learn all the functions (about 10 min) but after that I could program this in my sleep deprived state. I exclusively breast feed and used the feeding timer and misc timer to time feedings on each side. Being a month in to new motherhood, I don't care as much since my baby is packing on the pounds. I mainly use the timer for feedings and changings. I'm sure I'll later use it for naps as well as ""time outs"". The only thing I don't like is the clock keeps getting changed by buttons being hit. I also wish the back light would light up when you hit a button even when the buttons are ""locked"". All in all, I would highly recommend to any new parent."
39277,1,"I can't say enough good things about this stroller. I've used it for my twin daughters for nearly three years and it's still in perfect condition. So perfect, in fact, I'm handing it down to another set of newborn twins! Pluses are many: netting around seat works wonders for keeping cups, toys, binkies, etc safely inside (when babies get bigger, simply unzip and remove and let their little legs dangle down); very easy to maneuver with one hand b/c of the single bar; very easy to collapse and set up; I also found it very easy to lift and store; the frame is narrow enough for just about any standard doorway and the bench seat is still roomy enough for both of my girls to have toys, blankets, and snacks while riding; lastly, as your kids grow, parts can be removed to accommodate bigger sizes and improved agility - i.e. the front bar pops off and your 2 yr old can climb in and out on their own.I've also used it with kids of different ages on family outings with great success. And it's seen more than its share of airports (doesn't fit thru x-ray machine, you have to hand it over for a manual scan), restaurants, zoos, parks, uneven terrain, you name it - I pushed it there. They should call this stroller the Zooper Trooper rather than the Tango!Strollers are a huge investment and there are so many to choose from these days. I can honestly say that this was money well spent. For your hard earned money, this is as good as it gets. Hope this helps!"
154713,0,"I like these travel wipes, but I don't like the packaging. The opening/closing piece of plastic is too easy to lose or tear. I wanted a travel pack that was not too bulky, so I chose these because they are Seventh Generation AND 36 count, but the fact that the opening gets lost and the wipes dry out has turned me away from these to find something else. It is really hard to pull these wipes out one at a time when my 18 month old is squirming. I end up pulling out an entire wad and then trying to squish the rest back in."
110142,0,"When I bought this, the product title was not so explicit that it was one solid piece (shield + connector). Therefore, you can't customize your shield size and I find it more difficult to clean than two separate pieces, and bulkier to store as well. However, it does work with my pump; I just wish you could take the top apart."
20320,0,"In the first month and a half of my baby's life, we went through an enormous challenge trying to breastfeed, but, due to low milk supply (yes, I tried Fenugreek and a bunch of other stuff!), switched to mostly formula. We experimented with a bunch of bottles, so here is a comparison review:Least Favorite: The First Years BreastflowThe First Years Breastflow BPA Free Bottle 3-Pack, 5 OzWe tried the Breastflow first because it was recommended by my lactation specialist as being the closest to the breast. In that respect, it does have an advantage. I haven't seen any other bottles on the market designed to mimic the mother's nipple the way these are. However, there were other problems with this bottle that ultimately made it my least favorite. Primarily, the flow was extremely variable. At times we would find it was flowing so fast my daughter would be dribbling everywhere, and then at the next feeding it would be so slow she could barely get anything out. This was ultimately very frustrating and we decided to move on.Just Okay: Playtex VentAirePlaytex BPA Free VentAire ADVANCED Wide Bottles 9 oz - 3 Pack (Colors Vary)The second type of bottle we tried was the VentAire. We stuck with the wide nipple to hopefully continue to support breastfeeding. Luckily for us, though, our baby adapted really well to different types of nipples and didn't really have more trouble latching after switching to primarily using bottles. The nipple shape may be a bigger issue for some babies. We liked the flow of the VentAire better since it seemed more consistent. However, the nipples were constantly getting clogged! Some occasional clogging is inevitable if you're using formula, but we found ourselves having to unclog before almost every feeding, then sometimes in the middle of the feeding as well. It was frustrating to us and to our baby when her meal got interrupted.Our Favorite: Dr. Brown'sDr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 8 oz - 3-PackThe Dr. Brown's have definitely been our favorite bottles overall. The flow of the Level 1 nipple was very consistent and when our daughter turned 3 months old we switched to the Level 2 with much success. It is very rare that we have a clogged nipple or a leak, although those things do happen once in a while. It is a little bit of a hassle to clean the extra parts, but the dishwasher racks are very helpful with that.A note on gas:Both VentAire and Dr. Brown's claim to help reduce gas and spit-up. I have no idea if either made any difference with our daughter. She spat up sometimes before we switched to these bottles, and she still spits up sometimes now. As our pediatrician says, ""It's what babies do."" People who have had babies with severe colic or other issues may have been able to notice a bigger change due to the bottle design, but we didn't see much."
36727,0,"I was thrilled to receive this at my baby shower but when the baby arrived and it was time to start using it, I was a bit let-down. I am tall and had to hunch over to nurse- after a short while this became extremely hard on my back. I had a C-section with my daughter and this pillow put more strain on my back and abdomen than I could take. My husband and I still use it, but we have to stuff pillows underneath it to prop up the sides. Also, the cover I wanted cost the same as the pillow- 25.00! I hate when companies exploit their customers by charging ridiculous sums of money for pretty basic goods. I know by now though that people- including my self- will spend any amount of money on anything having to do with babies."
171277,1,This is an excellent product. My newborn preemie baby always loved it during bath. Sling really help you to have a control over your baby during bath.
166273,1,The pampers where sealed and just like off the shelf except the box was sightly damaged. But the pampers inside the box where still in plastic bags sealed. Would and am presently purchasing more..
89682,1,"For my son, Huggies would always leak in his sleep. Pampers Baby Dry has a more snug fit and they keep my son dry at night."
150604,1,"This iis a great jogger. Cruises really smoothly. It was easy to assemble. My only complaint is the under-carriage cargo basket. Because of the jogging it's not anchored to the back of the frame, only the front, and therefore can only carry one kilogram without dragging on the ground. I wanted to be able to carry more so I rigged it with two nylon straps."
24180,2,I was not a big fan of this swing. My daughter only used it a few times and she hated it. Her head always fell forward! I do not recommend this swing or even any like it. I wish I would have bought a cradle swing! I put my daughter in my friends cradle swing and she fell right to sleep! I think fisherprice makes one and then there is the baby papasan? That is a good one! I will definitly be buying a cradle swing for the next baby!
174506,0,"Music is nice, good volume, good timing. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars: the &quot;stuffed animal&quot; toys kept falling down and landed on baby. Of course they didn't hurt her (they are very soft and light), but they surprised her and that didn't help her relax! I threw them away and put the plastic toys back on, which is fine because she loves to watch them."
65747,1,i was looking for a projection type mobile and this was is awesome..the music is soothing (the same music all the ocean wonders items play) and the projection even leaves us mesmerized! the best part is the remote..not sneaking in to reset it if our son wants to see more..
153870,0,"We bought two boxes of these without having tried them first. They are pretty good wipes, but they seem to get dry much quicker then other wipes, which results in us having to use more or sometimes even wet the wipes with water. My child has very senstive skin, which is why we decided to try them. And, I've alway been happy with Seventh Generation brand."
161378,1,I am the proud mom of Baby Zen who is one month old. The directions of this product MUST be followed. It has helped me so much. My baby loves laying on the plastic platform. It doesn't leak...one must know how to snap it into place.
32455,1,"This gate is my favorite baby gate. Easy to install, no screws in the wall required, and it feels very sturdy. I use it at the top of my stairs and have no worries that it will not hold up. My 15 month old likes to hold on to the gates and shake them, this one doesn't budge like another one we have. I think technically it is supposed to take two hands to open the latch (a safety feature) but after you get used to it there is a way to do it with one hand.I would definitely recommend this gate, we have 2 in our house."
15588,1,This gate worked perfectly when our young toddler was on the move. It fit perfectly around an odd shaped corner which housed a stove.
12606,1,"We have been using this stroller from day 1 with our now 2 1/2 month old twins. We live in a high-rise apartment building on the 6th floor down a long hallway. It's been a complete life-saver getting the boys from the parking garage to our door. The basket below is quite large. I usually hang the diaper bag from the handle bar & fill the basket with whatever I need to (groceries, etc...) then snap the boys in on top. This allows me to do small shopping trips on my own and be able to get everyone and everything into the apartment by myself. We'll start using our duoglider more after they have outgrown this stroller, but the basket in the duoglider only holds about 2/3 of what this one does in the basket."
30996,1,"I purchased this stroller before a vacation last month and love it! It took me about 5 or 6 minutes to put it together out of the box. The front seatbelt is easy to adjust. I love the parent organizer that came with it too! The one I got has two cup holders (the one I purchased for my sister only had one cup holder) and works great! My older daughters love to ride in the back. It is so much lighter than the usual double stroller. I was so happy to get rid of the old stroller! The only problem I've had is that my daughter's sippy cups are the tall ones and the cup holder in the fron tray isn't very deep, so if you hit a significant bump, the cup falls out a lot. I haven't noticed that the storage basket is too small, it's perfect for us. The foot rest in the front is a bit small, but hasn't been a problem. The material is really easy to clean and it seems really durable."
100782,1,"Compare to huggies, i like the pampers better! The first two month, I used huggies coz it has the shape for avoiding belly bottom but when he growing bigger, it started to leak, and it leaks a lot, since I changed the papers baby dry, it never leak again! Just made for my 3 month old baby."
21396,1,"My kids (4 and 2 years old) love our outdoor trampoline, so we got this for the winter months. It's small enough to store out of the way and they love playing on it to burn off energy during the long winter."
39617,1,"My 6 month old kept kicking off his blankets, so the sleep sack has helped a lot. The sizing is a little funny, see other reviews for more details to help you get the right size. It's winter now, which makes the fleece great, but in summer it would definitely be too hot."
145027,1,"Diaper bag is very good quality material. Bag has plenty of pockets for all kinds of things inside and out. Bag is great for diaper bag, but I wish it had a little more room(width) inside the bag to throw purse items such as a checkbook wallet and makeup bag so I don't have to carry my purse too. All in all a good purchase and good quality diaper bag."
73085,1,"I bought this product a few months ago after looking at several different kinds and reading all the reviews. I really wanted to post my thoughts for those of you who just aren't sure, and to clear up some of the other reviews. First...this product is wonderful...it fits on ALL shopping carts...believe me, I've tried them all...even the large ones at Sam's Club, and the newer carts at Target and the grocery; and it still fits the high chairs in restaurants...yes, it is a little bulky in the high chair with excess material, but it keeps my daughter in the seat secure without having to use the safety belt and all her toys and crumbs are contained for the most part.Second, there is an arguement that it is not good because you can't put it on the cart one handed. The simple answer to that is to park right next to the cart coral, grab a cart, put this on, and then put your child in the cart...done!I LOVE it and would recommend it to everyone!"
98691,1,I bought two of these after reading reviews of them. One is for my 18 month old and the other is for my 34 month old. My 18 month old is on the small side so he looks lost in the seat but it still fits him correctly and he has lots of room to grow into it. My other son is very tall and was getting too big for his other car seat. Now this one is perfect and he too still has lots of room to grow into. Well worth the price. The fabric is nice. I love that the belts/straps have an anti twist device on them because that was the problem we always had with our other car seats. The straps would twist and it would take foever to get them the right way. I definitely recommend this seat!
159183,2,"this was a gift for my second child and i thought that this was a really cute product. but it is not a very liked toy by my baby!! he is four months old and we have used this maybe four times!! the seat that my first born had five years ago, seemed alot safer! this seat has alot of complaints from me!! while the fish are really cute to look at, the back rest of the chair just seems too narrow!! with my first born, there was more of an arch in the back rest and i never had to worry about him falling out, i am too afarid to put my baby in this for fear he will fall over the sides!!! and the staps are way too short!! i would recommend do not waste your money!!!"
165005,0,"Personally, i found that the Luvs were just as functional (no blow-outs, keeps the butt dry) and same softness at a significantly cheaper price. This product worked well, but not as much a value as the Luvs pack."
106953,1,i refused to buy the genie for the simple reason of i didnt want to be bothered with refills and i read that it clogged. so i decided on this one and glad i did. it is most excellent at keeping the foulest of stenches out. and i love that i dont have to buy those EXPENSIVE refills. just use the bags you have in your kitchen! easy to replace when full and it just works!!!
147392,1,"This table was purchased to be abused by my toddler, and for that it will do just fine. It is strudy, provides a nice surface for playing, the lip around the top keeps sutff on the table, the corners are not too sharp, and there is good storage in the trundle drawers.The quality of the wood is okay - some solid wood(legs, trim pieces), some particle board (all the broad flat pieces); no mdf. The finish is patchy - not uniform in color and the particle board edges of the drawers chip quite easily and make it look shabby. The bolts for trundle drawers show on the front - you can see this in the picture - I didn't really notice when I ordered, but it looks kind of cheap. It took me about an hour to assemble it while my husband sat on the couch watching the tube.If you want a really nice looking piece of furniture, keep looking (Pottery Barn Kids and Land of Nod have similar and maybe nicer items.) If you want a solid, multi functional piece that can take abuse and is not too expensive, this is a good choice. If you can swing it in a lighter color, do so - the dark finish is not great out of the box and is not holding up, a lighter finish would not show these flaws as much."
47116,2,"I spent a few weeks researching tandem strollers and finally settled on the Joovy Caboose Ultralight. I was very disappointed when it arrived. I used it for a couple of weeks before finally selling it on craigslist, taking a loss, because there are a couple of huge design flaws that I couldn't live with. I then bought the Baby Trend Sit n Stand LX and love it. First of all, it is about $100 cheaper than the Joovy, and, in this case at least, more expensive certainly does not mean better.I have a 4-year-old and a 2-month-old. I knew that my 4-year-old would want to walk on outings but hop on a stroller when she got tired. I also knew that I'd be using the infant carseat with the stroller for at least four more months with my infant son.There are three things about the Joovy that I preferred to the Sit n Stand (minor things that are not deal breakers by any means):1. The Joovy is lighter (by about four pounds), so it is slightly easier to turn and maneuver than the Sit n Stand; its wheels also seem to roll a little more smoothly. However, the maneuverability comes at the sacrifice of function (more about this later).2. The Joovy neoprene parent organized has a ton of space for keys, wallet, and phone and is very functional. The Sit n Stand parent organizer is a hard shell; it has room for two smaller water bottles, which is great, but neither my keys nor my BlackBerry will fit in the middle closed compartment, thus rendering it nearly useless - it's just too small to be functional.3. The oversized canopy on the Joovy covers both kids, which is nice on a very hot and sunny day or in case you get caught in a rainstorm. However, the canopy is also bulky and a little cumbersome; when you don't need it fully open, it gets in the way.That being said, there are many things I prefer about the Sit n Stand:1. The Sit n Stand is a little lower to the ground and thus feels more stable when moving.2. The Sit n Stand has a carseat attachment that you can snap the infant carrier into. The Joovy Caboose attachment is really a tray that the infant carrier sits ON TOP OF; it does NOT snap in, something Joovy obviously does not advertise because it's very cumbersome and annoying. To secure the infant carrier on the Joovy, you have to strap it in with an ugly red strap; even with the strap, the infant carrier sits awkwardly on top of the tray and doesn't feel like it's secure. In the instruction booklet, Joovy actually advises that parents check the carrier every few minutes to make sure the strap that holds it attached to the stroller isn't loose. The Sit n Stand attachment is awesome - the carrier snaps right in and is tight and secure in the front seat of the stroller.3. The Joovy basket is very small and hard to get into. I could barely get my purse in there, much less a diaper bag. The Sit n Stand basket is larger and has snaps on the side that you can open, thus making the basket easily accessible and usable.4. The Sit n Stand can be folded with one hand; the Joovy cannot.5. The Sit n Stand actually folds smaller than the Joovy. It's a bit thicker when folded but significantly shorter, so it will fit in all trunks. The Joovy is VERY tall when folded and wouldn't fit in the trunk of my friend's Honda.6. The front seat on the Joovy is very shallow, only 8 inches. The depth of the Sit n Stand front seat is about 10 inches, making it much more functional for older kids. I could see my son, who's average size, outgrowing the Joovy seat by the time he's 18-months-old. He'll be able to use the Sit n Stand much longer.7. The Sit n Stand has a removable kid tray that easily snaps off with one hand. Once the younger child is older and bigger, it's easy to remove him/her from the stroller without lifting him/her over the top of the tray. The Joovy tray is very difficult to remove (I actually couldn't do it; my husband had to do it for me).8. However, the most obnoxious thing about the Joovy, and the main reason I traded it for the Sit n Stand, is that the back toddler bench seat is very small and moves/slides all the time, which is annoying and distracting for the kid AND the parent. Also, when the front seat is reclined (necessary to hold the infant carrier and for a younger child or a child who still naps during the day), it reclines halfway INTO the back bench seat, taking up about half the room of an already small seat. The older child then either has to stand (not great on long trips) or sit hunched forward with his/her feet awkwardly curled behind. This is a pretty big design flaw that I could not overlook. It makes the back seat essentially useless unless the front seat is not reclined. The Sit n Stand back bench seat is slightly larger, and the front seat, even when reclined, does not get in the way of the bench seat. The older child can thus sit comfortably upright even with the front seat inclined. The standing platform on the Sit n Stand is also larger and has a strap that you can buckle behind the child that the child can use for back support; the Joovy doesn't have this.Considering the above, the Sit n Stand LX is the hands-down winner. For nearly half the price, you get a much better, more functional stroller. Had I ""test driven"" both, I never would have bought the Joovy Caboose Ultralight. I think the Joovy looks kind of funky and trendy, so people fall for it, but it's a poorly thought-out stroller that is terribly overhyped."
174580,0,"I recently redecorated my almost 1-year old's room in Snoopy Peek a Boo theme, and bought this hamper. It is very very cute, but the wood is so thin that one part of it snapped on the very first day. Also, wood is unfinished so there is a chance you child can get a splinter or too."
152612,1,"I bought this near christmas as a gift to me. I just had my second child three weeks ago. This stroller is wonderful. I love how it fits through a standard door. I really researched double strollers before buying. I do not jog but have had a jogging stroller and the front wheel did not turn which was a pain. I also had a Graco witht he hard tires and it was the pits in stones. So this is great, plus with four wheels it is more balanced. It lacks some of the parents comforts like cup holders and a clock and things like that, but I do not miss them when you consider the pluses. I love the adjustable handle as my husband and I are both tall. I get a lot of looks when walking with the stroller. People comment on how nice it is. It folds down well and is very quick. I have always hated the front and back double as the child in back never seems to be able to see. I the side by side seem so big, but this once is great. LOVE it."
26962,1,Glad I got this. I'm a teacher- on my feet all day. Really helps with back pain & my swelling feet. Overall- very comfortable & hides under clothing.
141592,1,"Overall the toy walker is very educational, but the wheels roll too fast for first time walkers. Even when I put the wheels on the 1 gauge, for them to move slower, the wheels move too fast for my son to walk. He really loves to play with the buttons and he stand with it sometimes, but I have to help him walk with it. Overall it get 4 stars."
154399,1,"This product is very good. Our new born son got a pretty bad diaper rash when we used other wipes because he has highly sensitive skin however the rashes disappeared within three days of switching the wipes to this brand. They however are a tad expensive, although I would not substitute price over quality so I am still happy. There is little to no perfume or smell in these wipes which are probably what makes it great for babies with sensitive skin like my boy's."
107013,1,We selected this item because it does not require special refill. We have been using it for a month and love it. It's easy to use and seals very well. You can use regular trash bags or even plastic grocery bags. My husband said it was a little hard to open the top when he empties it but I guess that's why it seals well.
99870,1,We have triplets and we have tried a lot of different diapers and these are by far the best ones and what is even better is the price. We have two girls and a boy and never had leaks on either gender. We discovered that these worked for us pretty early on and I have stayed true to the pampers baby dry brand. In my experience these are what worked for us. We loved them....but potty trained now!!!
174514,1,"My daughter is 8 weeks and has loved this since since she has been a week old. She will lay in her crib watching this for over 20 minutes at a time. She just waves her arms and legs and making the cutest faces. I love the way there mobile pauses for her to focus and the color contrast is perfect for her. I change my daughter in her crib now so that when I am done she will stay in there and play!!! My only complaint is that it doesn't get any quieter and that it makes a clicking noise as it rotates. But she loves it so that is all that matters. I would recommend this to anyone!!!I have to edit this. When my daughter was around 8 months old the mobile stopped working. I think that for $35 this should have lasted longer. However, my daughter did love it. I just wanted to caution anyone who might be looking to purchase this product."
8605,1,"Just what I needed. Very soft cotton. No shrinking and it fits the mattress pad perfectly. American Company makes great sheets, dont waste your money on anything else."
99637,1,"LOVE these diapers. I have used a few different types and my son soaked through them. I used these both night and day, and for night I add a diaper liner b/c I don't think any diaper can handle 12 hours. If your son (it is usually the boys!) leaks through his diapers at night, buy the Bumkins diaper liners, fold 2 into quarters and place them in the front making sure the ""hose"" is pointing down. Since I have done this + Baby Dry diapers, no leaks!"
93335,0,"These are very soft blankets and are a nice size. The only bad thing about them is the corners frayed in the wash from the very firs time I washed them! These are nice, but there are better one's out there that hold up better...I like Carter's better (especially their stretchy micro fiber fleece)."
41366,1,"Best of the throw-aways. Very absorbant, the securing tabs work almost as good as the overnight pampers. In 18 months had 2 malfunctions. I highly recommend these diapers."
183976,1,It's comparable with huggies and pampers and it's cheaper and have nice smell. When I bought size3 I wasn't happy cause the tab was not flexible. Now they improved it and I have nothing bad to say anymore. Will order my 3rd box soon.
11782,1,"Some foods worked great in this but it only frustrated my baby with some others. By the time she mastered holding the handle she was moving into ""pick em up"" foods anyway. Good for ice for teething when they are little. Dogs can chew thru the mesh :("
28408,1,"This glider is awesome -- especially considering the price. The quality is comparable to gliders 2-3x the cost of this one sold at major baby retailers. It glides quietly and smoothly. The espresso color I got matches the espresso color of a completely different brand of crib+dresser I purchased making this glider a perfect and functional complement to the nursery. I have no issues with the padding -- I think they are both soft. My wife and I are not too tall, 5'3 and 5'7 so this glider is perfect for us. However, I could see the glider being a little tight for someone 6'+.Shipping was quick (as always with Amazon). I was surprised at how small the box was but everything was there. The ottoman requires no assembly -- just some shrinkwrap that was a little bit of a pain to remove. The glider itself was a cinch to assemble. Took about 15 minutes.Overall, like I said, this glider is awesome. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference if you put this alongside a glider that cost 2-3x the price at any of the major retailers."
32638,0,"I have to admit that this is a good quality as are their gates, but they don't give you much in the way of extention unless you only have to fill just an inch to maybe two and a half. The price was not great for what you get. There are only two bars and it leaves a big gap (my guess is if you have 40 or more inches). I measured my space and it's 42 inches. It should have been fine, but it leaves a big enough gap to fit a small dog. Their manual says 37 1/4""-42 3/4"" - One extension kit / 42 5/8""-48 1/8"" - Two extension kits. There's no reason why I should have a gap as big as I do, but I do. Also the tension rod doesn't work as well with the extention, as the tension rod with the gate alone. In summary, their extension recommendation measurements are not really that accurate and with this extention, the tension is not that sturdy especially when the gate is left open. In that position, it seems that the tension rod could easily slide off the wall. You can't really make it much tighter. If you want to spend the extra I would get two if your space is more than 40 inches. That will most likely also make the tension tighter. I gave it three stars for quality because it is heavy duty and good quality. They might need to be a bit more accurate about measurements or maybe add an extra rod for the measurements they give."
129834,1,"It would seem that everytime I read reviews about carseats or their base, there is always a complaint somewhere about how difficult it is to install. well let me tell you that I have a four year old and a newborn set of twins and I have never had any problems with any seat I've purchased. This one is no harder than anyother. In fact, its Wonderful!(as is the snug ride infant seat!) If for some reason you are having trouble with puting it in the car properly, PLEASE take it to your local fire department!!! Though many dont like to take the time to do such things or are too proud to admit its hard for them, let me remind you that this is your childs life were talking about and nothing is more important than the saftey of your baby or babies!! There are also a number of items you can purchase for only a few dollars more! (again a only few dollars to your baby's saftey!) you can purchase a latch system or if your car isnt compatable and you have a shoulder belt you can purchase a clip that holds both the straps together on one side so that it doesnt wobble.(many seats come with this already, check the back of the seat to find out) I could say alot more but am running out of room. Hope this has helped or influenced you just a little. Please take care and do everything possible for the saftey of your child!"
174627,2,This guard is ok. It doesn't velcro/attach to anything on the bottom of the stroller. It's worth the $10 I paid. I would definitely rather purchase a jogging stroller that had a weather guard attached to fit properly.
124772,1,My 2 year old absolutely LOVES this walker. It's the first thing she goes for in the morning and she comes back to it over and over throughout the day. She loves to place all her little toys on it and push them around. She has no problems whatsoever pushing it around. It's made of great quality so I expect it to be very durable.
20400,0,I was just about to complete my check out for this item and I thought I better check a couple other places on the web. My daughter is 3 and 39lbs. I saw that this Chicco stoller is for up to 37lbs on another site! sigh~ I thought I had the answer to my endless search. I wish the weight limits were easy to find on all the stollers as my daughter has not outgrown the ride yet.
77861,1,"I have an 11-month-old brother who is learning to walk and is always getting into things. Not for long, he didn't. My Mom bought this safety set from Babies-R-Us. We use it to childproof our house. Mom and Dad use these locks to keep my brother from being hurt because of playing with bleaches and ""eating"" electric cords and outlets. Now my brother tries to open the bleach cabinets, but he is never strong enough to open the doors or tamper with the perfumes and bleaches my Dad makes at his workshop. I can open it only to use perfume, and close it before my brother can play with these products. Nobody can open the locks because they are very strong."
29890,2,i wish i had read the reviews before buying this product. it's just as bad as the others say it is. do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on one that lasts longer and does a better (and quicker) job.
64438,1,"I just got my Citta Twin. I have a bad shoulder and have struggled long enough with my heavy (but otherwise good) Take me Too double. I have 3 kids ages 4, 2 and 9 mo. I got the Citta Twin for the younger ones to ride in 3 days a week when we take our 4 year old to Pre K. (The parking lot is across the street from her school, so I am constantly dragging the heavier stroller in and out for the 10 minute walk) I will be looking forward to bringing her in to school on Monday with this awesome little stroller. A couple of things:It is small. I am happy to say it is much smaller than my Take me Too when folded. It is smaller than I thought it would be when opened and moves EASILY through our doors at home.It is light. I can easily lift it in and out of my Nissan Quest with no shoulder pain. !!! :)It turns on a dime, it is SUPER EASY to steer. Much better than my last one. I can steer it with one hand. That will be a big help for a mom of 3 since I am constantly holding on to SOMETHING! :)It is slightly reclined even in the upright position, so my kids will be relaxing all the time. I hope that will be ok with them.The 5 point harness is neat and orderly, no long extra strap stuff hanging all over the place. I like that.The baskets are roomy, you could fit a small diaper bag and a few toys between both of them. I wouldn't go for a week's worth of groceries, but a meal or two worth of groceries would be fine. You can't access the baskets with the seat reclined, normal for all strollers I have had.Only potential problem is that it seems hard to open and close. It feels ""stiff"" from being so new, so I hope when it gets some use it will be easier.With the money I saved not getting one of the more expensive models, I am purchasing the Lascal 3G Buggy Board for my older daughter to ride on the back of one side. It steers easily from the sides, middle or just one of the 3 handles, so I think the buggy board will work great. She gets tired very quickly, and I think that will be the best solution for mall trips and such. (She used to ride on the step between the seats of the Take Me Too, a great solution for parents of 3.) I am also getting a cup holder for my own drink.I am writing this review early into my purchase, only because there are so few review on this product. I had a hard time deciding, but I think I made the right choice. By the way, the RED is so adorable! Enjoy."
85427,1,"My husband got this for me as part of my Christmas present and I absolutely love it! I typically sleep on my back so by the time I needed to sleep on my side, I was having a very hard time adjusting. I would wake up throughout the night realizing that I was sleeping on my back and trust me and by the morning I just wasn't fully rested. I tried surrounding myself with multiple pillows without much luck.Yes this pillow is wide. It takes up half of bed on our Cal King, however, it is worth every penny! I now can sleep throughout the night on my side. I think this is one of the best investments for those of you who cannot sleep well during your pregnancy. I love it and I would recommend it to anyone that has the room for it in their bed!!"
66301,0,"I just received these bowls - I ordered two sets. I'm actually thinking about returning the set that I haven't opened...! The suction base works about as well as what you'll find anywhere (sticks best on the plastic high chair tray), but as other reviewers have said, the base is difficult to put on to the bottom of the bowls. You really have to tug hard, and then sometimes the threads on the bowl bottom aren't completely covered by the base. Another issue is that once you have the lids snapped on (yes, that's hard to do too), you have an equally hard time pulling them off without the bowl jerking in the opposite direction. That might not be a problem if the contents are solid enough not to spill, but loose food (e.g. Cheerios) or anything a little soupy is likely to go flying.In all fairness, I haven't tested them with food yet. If this review proves to be grossly inaccurate, I will come back and edit it..."
180977,1,"... and thats what counts. At first she was a bit overwhelmed (3 months old), but you can remove many of the toys and then add them as needed. Also good for tummy time."
98146,1,"This paci holder works okay but really, it's a great price. My son has used this for months and while he is strong enough to pull it off of his clothing, which I suppose defeats the purpose, I still like this holder. I think my son pulls it off because he wants to chew on the bear. After using 4 different styles of paci holders, I have to say that I honestly don't think there is any paci holder that a child cannot pull off their clothing."
22652,1,"This is the perfect must have item for grandparents. It covers the needs for overnight, babysitting, etc. It folds and stores to almost nothing."
27450,0,"Por favor ay&uacute;denme, me gustar&iacute;a saber si este articulo es un colch&oacute;n o es una cubierta para el colcho?GRACIAS"
135944,1,"I can't believe more people don't know about these. My baby was very fussy, especially in the night. He would get up crying every hour. I wasn't sure what to do, I found these bottles and decided to give them a try. He started doing so much better right away! With ordinary bottles when the baby is sucking on the nipple you can see the bubbles coming up in the formula, the baby is then sucking in quite a bit of air, even with the expensive advent bottles, which is what I had before. With these bottles the air goes up the tube and does not get in the formula. I tell everyone I know about them. I just wish my son didn't have to go the month that he did without them. He was in pain for no reason, THESE ARE GREAT!!!! Do your baby a favor and buy them."
135970,1,"I gave it a 5 star rating, it's not quite there, as far as quantity goes. It works great, does the job, and no, you can't make a four week supply of food for your baby (but who does?), but if you want to make something fresh every day, this is the one to use."
42345,1,This was a registered gift for a baby shower. They really loved it---tried all the different ways it can be tied and worn. It was a hit.
59561,1,"I love these locks! I especially like the fact that I can lock and unlock them when I need to! I highly recommend them for those of you who need to keep little hands from opening cupboards or cabinets. Make sure you buy a Tot-lock key with these locks, or you won't be able to get your cupboards open if they are in lock mode!"
53836,1,"I bought this table for my 5 year-old son. He is 48 inches tall and wieghs 50lbs. This table is perfect for him. It is just the right fit. The chairs fit him perfectly and the table is just the right height. He does homework, puzzles, and builds legos on this table. We got the cherry wood table and it is very nice. I love it and so does my son.I read a lot of reviews about how this table was so hard to put together. My husband had absolutely no problem. He assembled this table in less than an hour with only a screwdriver. Everything fit right were it was supposed to!!!!!"
102713,2,"I was so mad when I got the package. The name for it is ""travelmate cas seat"", well...there was NO CAR SEAT !!!!!!!!!!! It is not worth $78, if it does not include a car seat!!! I was BS!!!"
43004,1,"I'm not usually one to write reviews, and I've only been using this product for a whopping 90 minutes, but OH MY GOD it has magical powers. My 8-day-old baby has been fussy for the last 36 hours and I was at the end of my rope this morning. I decided that today was the day to try out the Moby Wrap I had gotten at my baby shower. It was a little hard to figure out how to put on the first time, but nothing a decently smart adult can't figure out. Two or three attempts and 10 minutes later it was on and I'll be able to do it again like a pro later. When I put my son in, he seemed confused for a minute or two and then was fast asleep in 3 minutes flat. I could not be happier. The only reason I'm able to write this review right now is that both of my hands are free - for the first time in days! And he is still happily sleeping on my chest. All of my friends who recommended this product to me were not wrong - this thing is amazing."
169205,1,pampers is one of the best. tried huggies they leak. recommend everyone get pampers for there newbord
68141,1,"I am very happy with this purchase, the construction of this sheet is wonderful, it fits perfect, the side gusset is at least 9"" deep and the elastic is all around. Color stay well after numerous washings. Best crib sheet I purchased so far for my baby girl."
104173,1,"I got this for my newborn and I really love it. I wanted an infant car seat that I could use with a stroller as a travel system.This car seat goes great with the Pliko P3 stroller. I was also looking for a fun bright color for my baby boy and not the usual patterns and prints that you see at your local baby. It also has high safety ratings. At first I was looking at the Britax infant car seat, but it is so much bulkier than this one. This one fits great in my VW Tiguan."
31449,1,"nice design, cute ( I got white), simple, & does what it should. Def would recommend. 4 stars because the top thing got stock & I cannot remove it, LOL"
37038,2,"i consider myself to be a carseat gestapo when it comes to getting 1) the seat tightly enough in the car (i expect it not to move AT ALL), and 2) the straps close to my child's chest (NO more than 1-2 fingers under the strap at the collarbone). well, this carseat has been a nightmare since day one! although we can get it in our Odyssey so it doesn't move (and yes the tether is a pain to adjust), once it's in we CANNOT get the straps tight enough on our daughter. i've pulled and pulled and pulled until i literally popped one of my ribs out of its cartilage (extremely painful injury)!!!this seat may be a wonderful booster seat, but it STINKS as a 5-point harness seat. i'm throwing it away i'm so disgusted. i've got a Britax on order and cannot wait til it arrives. i love our other Britaxes (Roundabouts) that we now use for our son since our daugther outgrew them. i don't know why i tried to cut corners and buy one seat rather than one now to take her to 65 pounds in a 5-point harness and another later for a booster.carefully examine your child in this seat if you do buy it. my bet is that your child is NOT in the seat tightly enough to be safe."
156139,1,My only concern with this toy is that it almost works too well! My LO has loved this since he got it around 2 months. He can spend up to 40 minutes without even making a fuss. He is learning to use his hands and loves listening to the music. I love how there are different settings that grow with my child's learning curve. I also love that the voice is not completely annoying like some toys and that I haven't got sick of it after 2 months of use! I'll be getting more Leap Frog products in the future because of it.
107283,1,"This is a great pail. It originally appealed to me because of the cost benefit of using any old plastic bag. We buy the generic tall kitchen bags. We soon found that another benefit is that you only have to change the bag every 6 or 7 days! Additionally, it really has a one-handed operation."
181562,1,Perfect gate for my ferrets. This is just what I have been looking for. It works great! It keeps my ferrets in their room so I know they are safe.
45042,1,Wonderful playmate!!!! Bought for my new Grandbaby while less than 2 months old and it is still a big hit getting use everyday!!! beautiful colors and lots of fun for the baby!!!!!
181991,1,My boy will use this over the real potty because it is easy for him to get to. He is 20 months and it is working great.
122772,0,My 2-month old has a difficult time trying to suck the pacifier so not much comes out of it.It's also hard to open the dispenser.
36430,2,"We were initally pleased with this chair, however as time went on the seat began to sag back. Our son, now 18 months old, has to pull himself forward just to eat. The joints between the front and rear legs have separated and we're now researching new high chairs since we're concerned about the possiblity of the joint failing completely."
133103,1,I have owned a Diaper Genie and Diaper Champ. The champ was the worse which was closely followed by the smelly Genie. I had given up on having an odor free nursery when I had my 2nd child in 2006. Then I read the reviews & decided to give it a go. We bought the Diaper Dekor system & it's been 15 months. We LOVE it!There is almost never an odor. It is so easy to use & once you have changed the refill once it's really simple. I wish the refills were a little cheaper but they do last a long time. It really is hands free you just step on the pedal which opens the door to throw the diapers in.We are expecting our 3rd child soon & I will happily be using our Dekor still.
160687,2,I was very excited about this sheet until I washed it. I bought one then received two others as gifts. Two out of the three sheets fell apart after they were washed. The tabs on the end fell off. I washed in cold water and tumble dried low.Am I the only one with this problem?
92358,1,I'm a first-time mom-to-be and I received this as a gift at my baby shower. I did register for and and I'm glad because I wanted a sampler of baby products that I'm completely unfamiliar with. Now I can try out the most common and reasonably priced baby products.
125505,1,My 5 month old loves to chew on this! Very easy for him to hold and play with.
29450,0,"Color didn't really match the nursery, but decent valances nonetheless. A little pricey for the quality."
174325,1,"These seat belt clips keep the belts off our necks. I don't mind to buckle up when it's comfortable. Adjustable to everybody and can be removed and used in rental cars too. Very ""cheap, cheerful, and practical""."
138083,1,Little thing in life are wonderful. Grandchildren love these not only something to hold on too but with the light it keeps the scarry closet monsters away.
91275,0,"I bought this moniter after my friend recommended it. I am sorry that I did not do research first. Although hers works just great, mine was pure static from day one. If I turn it down to the lower settings, I can still hear my baby okay and the static isn't too bad, but, if I had to do it all over, I would invest in a more expensive model, or forego the moniter altogether. From what I can tell, you have a fifty/fifty shot of getting a static-free model. I lost the gamble; I hope you have better luck!"
152220,1,"I initially bought this light from Babies R Us and we liked it, but it hasnt even been two months when it broke...I looked all over but I couldnt find another light that attaches directly to the crib so I decided to give this one another try... (Bought one from amazon and the one I got in the mail did not work as well. I have to say though that returning item to Amazon was the easiest thing I ever had to do and was absolutely AMAZING. They overnighted a new light the same day I put in the defected device claim and the next day before the mailman picked up my shippment back to them I already had new night light by my door (fedex overnight). So that was awesome.)Well this new one works so far, its been about a month. I will update if it breaks!!!Batteries do not last long so stock up. But I love the fact that its voice activated and attaches to the crib and it works perfect in that regards for us."
184749,1,"Love it. Wish it were not so hard to take apart and more collapsible. It would be nice if the bouncy part tilted back on the floor, hard for small, floppy-headed newborns but it's good."
180413,1,"This is a great weekend bag when daddy is with us. I have a skip hop studio tote that I use during the week when I'm alone with the baby. On the weekend daddy gets to be in charge of the diaper bag, and it is definitely masculine friendly."
184625,1,"I didn't have a problem with fit either. In fact, the elastic that goes all the way around the sheet makes for a snug fit and gives me piece of mind that the sheet won't snap off. The sheet itself is soft, much more so than the regular cotton sheets. My only complaint is that it seems like it may stain easily. I've washed mine only once and there looks like there is a small stain. I could be wrong since I have a dark blue sheet...it just may be where some color bled out a little. Overall, this sheet is a great buy at a low price."
83213,1,"I bought this because everyone I know with a new baby has one (or some other brand). I thought it was supposed to be a back saver. It is not. This is not the thing to use for a stroll around the mall or even around the block, unless you work out a lot and have really strong shoulders.However, it is extrememly convenient in cases where you will be sitting and don't want to haul in the car seat or stroller where space is limited. My daughter is just 8 weeks, but so far I have been able to use this in restaurants, at ball games, movies, etc. It is better than a regular pack type carrier (in these cases) because the baby can lie down, and in the case of a restaurant is out of the way for you to eat.It offers a variety of positions for baby for her optimal comfort. It is rather large, so if you are a thin person, it may be too big to really be able to use all of the positions until your baby is bigger. However, I have not washed it yet to see if it will shrink.I don't use it as often as I thought I would, but I'm glad I bought it"
42710,1,"I just love my Moby wrap! At first my son hated being in it, but after a few times he got used to it and is now very content riding in it while we go shopping. He goes to sleep without crying. I take him out of his car seat and put him in the wrap so I don't have to carry that heavy car seat around. He never cries and goes right back to sleep most times. I get asked about it all the time by expecting moms and dads who ask me where I got it so they can purchase one for themselves. It's one of the best things I ever bought for my son."
10358,1,"I'VE BEEN TRYING TO POTTY TRAIN MY ALMOST 3 YR OLD LITTLE BOY SINCE HE WAS 18 MOS. I TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT POTTY CHAIRS AND EITHER THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR HIM OR MADE A MESS WHICH WAS FRUSTRATING FOR BOTH OF US. SINCE HE'S A BOY, A GUARD IS VERY IMPORTANT. THIS ONE IS PERFECT. I'VE HAD THIS ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND HE IS DOING GREAT. ITS COMFORTABLE, EASY TO USE AND NO MESSES. I ALSO BOUGHT THE MATCHING STOOL. HE REALLY LIKES THAT AS WELL TO SIT ON HIS POTTY OR WASH HIS HANDS AFTER. I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE."
159228,2,"The movement and bubbles in the toy bar keep my baby entertained for a bit, and the gentle vibration helps on a constipated day(!!). But sadly the dangling toys are out of reach (even for my tall 4-month old), and are more frustrating for him than entertaining. The poor guy has trained himself to bat at the toys with his feet, and even grip on with his toes. But at the end of it the guy is so wired that I prefer not to have him do that. Would have been 5 stars if the toy bar had been closer to the baby."
131920,1,"Length:: 1:46 MinsI bought this frame second hand after seeing it on Amazon. I instantly regretted it when it was difficult to get the battery cover off. You know when you get that sinking feeling like you just wasted $25 and were a chump for buying second hand with no returns? My husband used a butter knife to get off the cover, so I felt a little better. Then, I had the same experience that many of the reviewers that said it just didn't work. It was on, and you could hear the motor clicking, but it wasn't moving. Then, I adjusted it and it looked like a mechanical bull. I could see the ""Whoaaaaaa!"" in my son's eyes. But, I kept fiddling with the dial to find the ""sweet spot"" and presto, a happy medium. I got this as a place to set my son's carseat when he fell asleep in the car. He has a difficult time staying asleep without nursing or movement. We have a 2 year old, and it can be tough unloading the groceries or getting her bath going if he wakes up the second we get him out of the car. I also have used it to keep him asleep after nursing so that I can get my daughter ready to go out the door before trips. I take the dog out to the bathroom, crate her, pack up the car, get the A/C going, strap in my daughter (we have a garage, so she's safe), and run and grab my son who's still sleeping in this swing. I put him in the car and go, and he stays asleep. Otherwise I have a fussy baby for 20-30 minutes down the road (he hates red lights because we have to stop, and he won't take a pacifier to soothe himself).I've added a video so that you can see how it works and how poorly it works if its not adjusted correctly. If its too slow, you'll hear a chugging or loud clicking...almost a grind. It will eventually stop moving. I've experienced this with my full-sized fisher price cradle swing too. If it's running to slow, you have to speed it up and give the swing a gently but firm push. The motor should quiet to a low click and smooth rhythmic mechanic sound. I can't tell if pushing the dial up makes it slower or if having it down makes it slower. The swing seems to get a good ""catch"" depending on where the dial is for the weight of the baby. I haven't used it long enough to give an opinion on battery life either.I give it four stars because its a lot of troubleshooting, and I recommend doing it when your child is awake. Find where the dial needs to be for your child's weight, otherwise you'll find yourself really frustrated that they woke up when the swing stopped. I'm sure it'll need to periodically be adjusted for your child's weight.On the good side, it takes up less room than a big swing, and it folds flat. So, you can easily take it to a friend's house or on vacation. I really think in a few years you'll see more of these if they can figure out how to label the dial in a way that's easier. A simple fix would be to put numbers on it, so you could easily adjust it to that number each time. As it is you'll just get a feel for where the dial needs to be."
67407,1,"I agree with the other reviews. This is a great TS and the stroller does glide easily. I do have some advice though. Do not buy if you have a 2-door car like we do. The car seat release latch is at the foot of the seat unlike the graco that release from behind the head. It's practical for a four door car, more so than the graco release. I have to put it behind the passanger seat and climb in on the driver side so that I can get to the release bc you have to pull and lift from the foot. My car is too small (focus zx3) to put it in the middle or behind the driver seat. Like most newer cars it has the LATCH on the outer 2 seats and not in the middle. Also when you go to collasp the stroller you have to be so careful bc the tray will scrape on the ground which makes it awkward to close.The base isn't supposed to move more than an inch in any direction... but it does move more, a lot more. Especially from side to side. I can't say that I have seen it do that while I am driving mostly bc I try and keep my eyes on the road. The (buttons??) that you squeeze to lower the carry handle on the seat are difficult. You have to apply the squeeze on both sides perfectly or else the handle won't go down, which is frustrating when you have a crying baby and have to struggle with them. And getting frustrated doesn't help your snychronized squeeze reflex.The basket on the stroller holds quite a bit of stuff. Over all I do really like the system and Hailey seems to think it's okay too."
44367,1,Received as described...fit both my babies' car seats perfectly and they're very different styles of seats! Kiddos seem to love their new seats and mom's soccer van is stylin'!
63298,0,"I have been pumping extra milk since my daughter was born four months ago. I used it several times a day in the beginning and now pump once, maybe twice a day. Considering how much I have used it I would say it's a pretty decent pump. I wake up in the morning feed my daughter with one breast and pump the other breast. I get a good 5oz in 20 minutes. I think that's pretty good. It isn't a top of the line pump, but you aren't paying top of the line money either. It can be loud at setting 3 and it's not fun to clean and sterilize since there are 4 parts plus the bottle. I do not like the Playtex bottles with the insert liners it came with because they make no sense. You cannot heat the milk in the liners, nor can you freeze it and I don't trust the accuracy of the measurements. I found that the Medela 5oz. bottles screw in easily with this pump's components and thank goodness for that!"
171475,1,"What's not to love about this tub? For the price , it is practicall a steal. The tub is even great for ""fresh out of mommy's belly"" newborns as it has a mesh attachment that you can use to sponge bath the baby. TI keeps the baby out of the water while letting you put a warm water source in the tub itself making it a breeze to clean the baby part by part while keeping the rest of the little one warm. Once the umbilical cord falls off that when the real fun beings!!!"
140173,0,"Ok so they have made some improvements, I have the older version, it is minus the cup holder, and the canopy is a bit different. that being said this stroller still needs imporvements. My biggest complaint is that the front wheel doesn't move (yes I knew that before I bought it) but untill you push this stroller with 55lbs of kid in it you have no Idea how difficult it is to push down on the handle to lift the front wheel and turn. my other problem is that my kids shoulders overlap (which causes fights and pushing). overall this is a good choice if you only run/walk on a straight path but where I live the paths have twists and turns. On the plus side I do like the basket and the front wheel is easy to take on and off (for storage)."
82804,1,I love this sheep. My son loves the waves sound. The whale sound is a little scary for him so I don't use it. But overall an excellent product.
28642,0,Overall ok for price... lot of room for improvement- Could improve cushion quality- sometimes make suound like it is getting struck- feel's light for heavy duty use.
180271,1,"This pump is great for when I want to stock up a few ounces of milk so I can have the afternoon to myself. I just freeze some milk and my husband can take care of the baby! I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has to go back to work, because it's a single pump and an electric one would get the job done so much faster!"
170382,1,"I originally purchased this seat at BRU and then found it for $50.00 cheaper and no tax and no shipping. I returned the ones that I purchased and repurchased them from traveling tikes.com. They had more of a selection on top of better prices.I absolutely love this car seat. The safety features alone are enough. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The 5 point harness cannot twist. A+++++++The straps velcro to the sides of the seat so you can find easily. A +++++++++++++++Being able to secure this seat from the front and the back is amazing. I cannot move this seat at all. I feel vey confident that my son will be safe in this seat if an accident should occur.I still have plenty of room in both vehicles. We have the carseat in the middle of the back seat and when we travel there is plenty of room on either side for my 70 pound yellow lab to lay down and not look cramped and uncomfortable.This is the best investment, I wish that I would have never purchased the infant carrier since my son was out of it by the time he was 4 months old.I would highly recommend the Britax Marathon Car Seat. A little expensive but, your cargo is priceless."
129748,1,"We liked this bed so much that we immediately ordered another. Handsome, all wood construction, seems very sturdy. I'm quite impressed."
88023,1,"They can do so little, until they are on the gymini mat. Doing what comes naturally results in movement, noise, and keeps even the youngest entertained. My grandson has been &quot;playing&quot; with his gymini since he was a few weeks old. (Get the wind chime attachment to go with it and your child can make even more noise.)"
123359,1,"My little one is 6 months old and we got this when he started to show more interest in toys and was rolling around and talking more. He loves laying in there and playing his toys and flopping around. It is bright and colorful and just the perfect size. It opens up very easily (in a second) and is built very well. We like to go to the park also, so we just pack it up and take it with us. It keeps him off of the ground and safe and he can have fun with all of us there too. Get it, you wont regret it."
153446,1,"I originally bought Chicco travel system. I hated how bulky and heavy it was. I wish that I would have gotten the bumbleride flyer right away.Bumbleride Flyer has convertible handles and switching literally takes 3 seconds. You can switch it from front to back and vice versa anywhere, even when the baby is in the stroller. MyChicco Keyfit 30 car seat fits in this stroller. The stroller fully reclines. The foot rest can be raised. The basket is large and fits my large diaper bag and other stuff. The canopy is really huge. The handles are adjustable, so pushing is comfortable for my husband, who is tall, and me. In addition, we were able to take this stoller on a plane with us (well, check it at the gate), rather than check it in with the luggage, since it is not huge. The stoller comes with the cupholder, the rain shield, and the part that should be used when you put a car seat in it. These things don't come with other strollers in this price range. It folds and unfolds pretty easily.Now a few cons to this stoller....Since I got the lava black color (my husband pushed for this color, I wanted the red one :)), is that it gets dirty pretty quickly. You can see all the stains. However, I just take the seat off and throw it in the washer (I could not do this with my old stroller). I don't dry it in the dryer, but it dries over night. The stoller does not ride best on gravel or sand. Another thing is that folding and unfolding is not as easy as on the City Mini, however everything else compensates for this.I highly recommend this stroller. It is the best alternative to other $600-$900 stollers. You really get a lot for your money here."
107916,0,This is a great pump to take on the go or if you only have to pump no more than once a day. Very well made & easy to assemble. It came with 2 bottles with newborn nipples which I thought was nice also. I did notice that the milk would get clogged in the neck of the shield & I would have to remove it from my breast so it would suction in bottle. Also sometimes the membrane would flip over than there would be no suction but what can you expect for a manual pump?
172492,0,"I received this tub/shower as a baby shower gift. My son loved the shower aspect of the tub and bathing him was a pleasure. However, the extra shower piece/function broke after about 4 uses. Since the new/extra shower piece costs just as much as the tub, we bypassed purchasing a new one and just use the tub as we would a regular infant tub. It's a shame that the function wasn't made better because my son really liked it. We found it very soothing for him."
174124,1,"I got this swing as a gift for my second baby. With my first child, we had a regular Graco 3-speed swing and he HATED it. I really didn't think that swings were all they were cracked up to be. But a friend of mine swore up and down about the Fisher Price Aquarium Swing -- saying that the back and forth cradle motion would make all the difference. I was skeptical, but thought I'd try it just in case. When I went to register, I picked this one over the Aquarium swing because I liked the colors and the Papasan seat looked so comfy. I was amazed with how my daughter took to this swing! She loves it. She's fascinated by the mobile. We both like the nature sounds it makes. And I especially love how she'll fall asleep so easily. This really is the greatest swing I've ever seen or used. Gives me a welcomed break during the day when I need my hands free. Definitely worth the extra money it costs!"
156017,0,"My children are 7 months old. They both love when this toy is pulled out though I find that they prefer to play with it and see it move around more than use it for teething. This isn't a bad thing, just saying."
116720,1,"My husband is almost always an XL but the vest's shoulders were too wide for him, and now I have to exchange for an L. The color is not as bright as I thought it would be, which is good. We haven't had the baby yet so haven't put it to use, but I took one star back b/c it seems a tad overpriced for what it is. The changing pad is nice, but that's really the only thing that distinguishes this vest from a non-DadGear vest."
45339,1,My son is 6 months old and literally plays on this mat everyday. He loves it. I love it. It's easy to clean and is machine washable. I would recommend this to any parent with an infant.
29594,1,"This mobile has been wonderful, we purchased this mobile two months ago for our second daughter. We've had several mobiles which have broken or that I wasn't that happy with. After re-decorating my daughter's room I went in search of a new mobile and found this one (it wasn't even in the mobile section of the store), I liked that it had a remote and that the box indicated it played a variety of soothing music and nature sounds. Wow have we been pleased. So many of the mobiles are just too cutesy for me and all of them seem to play the same boring music. This mobile seems very durable (we've only had it two months) and the music is very calming. It rotates through about 5 different songs and incorporates birds chirping and other nature sounds while the mother bird, babies and butterflies spin around. I like that the birds change direction since that adds interest for the baby while they are falling asleep. We haven't needed to use the remote that often but it is a nice feature. I am very happy with the purchase and feel it was a good value for the money."
40171,1,"I've tried Pampers, Luvs and Huggies. Huggies were a TERRIBLE fit while Luvs were OK, but had some leak problems. Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers are the best fitting I've found, and I've never had leak issues. I also tried those new Huggies, that are supposed to have that hourglass fit - those had the worst leaks of all. The hourglass is TOO wide and not in the right area of the legs, and the poop and pee came right out. If anyone has ever had leaks with Pampers, I've got to believe that they were using the wrong size. (I also use Pampers Baby Dry for night-time.)"
184123,1,I recomend this product to all parents. My child has sensative skin. Therefore this balmex worked better than all the other balmex and ointment treatments. My childs rash cleared up within the most 24 hours.
179917,2,"Didn't work. The swaddlers that have velcro are so bulky and get messed up in the wash. I bought this cause of no velcro & hoped it would help my baby sleep, who sleeps like 3 hours out of a 24 hour period.It didn't. Baby busted right out of it and bawled her eyes out."
162688,2,"this collapsed while the baby was in it! i contacted saftey first - they were rude and unsymphatetic - they said no other complaints were logged - read through the rewiews from other parents - you will find that many say the hinges broke while the baby was in the tub - this can couse a SEVERE INJURY TO YOUR CHILD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I bought an inflatable tub and i have been so happy with it! PLEASE, PLEASE do not buy this tub for your baby - its made poorley and someone is going to really get hurt while using it"
87262,0,"I love the Playtex bottles, but I strongly recommend buying the new Easy Feeder. The Easy Feeder has a burper which is my only complaint about the original and premium playtex nursers. Prior to feeding the bag or drop-in has to be burped which is easily done by pushing it up until milk comes out of the nipple. The problem is while feeding, if you have to stop and set the bottle down, air goes back in and needs to be re-burped. It is very dificult to burp when there is less milk. Your hand can not fit into the bottle high enough. Some people use a spoon to push it up, but who wants to carry around a spoon too and use two hands. With the Easy Feeder, each time you just slide it up (with one hand after some practice)...much easier and faster when your baby is hungry."
7021,1,"We are very happy with these diapers. We have tried Huggies, Pampers, and some store brands, and Pampers have been best for us. While blowouts are not entirely avoidable, there seem to be fewer with the Pampers. These Cruisers fit our daughter well - she can stretch in all directions, which is great for our little one learning to get around on her own. Leaks are not a problem. We can feel warmth as soon as she goes, which makes me think the moisture is wicked farthest away from her skin very quickly. We recommend them!"
169952,1,"I rated this crib 4 out of 5 only because our baby is due April (2013) and we havent yet used. My sister in law has two of these for her twins and they loved them and were happy with this purchase. Knowing they really liked the dribs and some reading I did, we decided to buy it. It was very easy o put together and it looks great! Yes, some of the bolts are exposed but you hardly notice! They include a handy little cubby under the drib to store instructions ans extra bolts for when baby graduates to a toddler bed. I read and looked at many cribs and am very glad we bought this one! Great price, great look! We are planning on purchasing the Emily dresser as well."
20768,0,"This product was great for the first two months. Wash off the parts and the bottles in the sink, toss them in the bag, sterilize, and put them on the drying rack for use. Easy as pie.After a couple months though, this product becomes nearly useless. My 2oz preemie bottles, and 4oz newborn bottles fit perfectly in these bags with no problems, but the bag can't fit the standard 8oz bottle size that most babies will use. What good are sterilized bottle parts if you can't sterilize the bottle at the same time?!# I ended up sterilizing all the parts and throwing the bottles in the dishwasher, basically defeating the purpose of the bags.A good alternative are the Munchkin bags. Munchkin bags are about half an inch to an inch longer and can fit at least two 8oz bottles and sometimes three bottles if you pack it just right, along with all the bottle parts for those bottles and even some extra pacifiers. Do yourself a favor and get the bigger and far more useful Munchkin bags for the same price, you will be able to continue to use those bags as your baby grows."
10931,1,"My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out. He is getting better now after a few months of having them. He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out! It's a great cup that way, totally spillproof! Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer. The valves are easy to put in and take out, my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice."
76095,1,These trays work so well for freezing your own baby food. I love the cover that snaps on. Makes it easy to stack them in the freezer.
50014,1,"I give this product a top score for ease of use. As a single mom, I can't just hand my baby to someone else while I tangle myself up in a complicated wrap or adjustable carrier. Sometimes my daughter will be very fussy when I put her down, so I love that I can attach this to my body while holding her, and tighten it with the pull of one strap. It is super easy to put on- you just clip the belt around your waist, place your baby on your hip, slip the strap over your head and pull to tighten.I also like that baby's legs are free when using this product. Most side-slings either tuck baby's legs up inside, or dig in uncomfortably on those chubby thighs. My daughter is really big for her age, so I love that she can be comfortable and move freely while being carried.It isn't the most comfortable thing for mom, but short of the top-of-the-line hiking backpacks, this creates far less pressure points than any carrier I have used. Ultimately having 20+ lbs strapped to your body, whether it be to your back, front or side, is not going to feel amazing.I do wish there was a way to tighten it more. I'm a petite woman with very narrow shoulders (I can actually wear children's Tshirts) and even fully tightened, the little toy strap that is right up on mom's chest in the photo sits about the base of my rib cage. It all evens out though as my daughter is a hefty 20.5 lbs and 30 inches at only 8 months old, so she fills in the gap with NO problem.This carrier is extremely portable. It rolls up really small, which is perfect for travelling. Throw this in the diaper bag and there is no need to take the stroller out with you."
44886,1,"For anyone that breastfeeding is important to, this is the pump for you! Especially for full-time working moms!! I was able to keep at my goal of breastfeeding for 6 months and kept my supply regulated with this dream of a pump! I can't say enough good things about it. Try it yourself and you will see. It is definitely worth the money!"
165821,1,"Good quality product, but not great for our 1 yr old to wear overnight. Overall we've been satisfied with it for use during the day."
87569,1,"So far, so good. This seems to be a great walking/jogging stroller for the money. It's a little heavy - but I knew that when I purchased it. My daugher seems very comfortable in the stroller. Was very easy to assemble."
8234,2,This item broke in four different places along the top during the first day of use. The basket is not as pliable as others I've seen and is made of very cheap materials. Not at all suited for use for a baby. Do not buy this item or you'll be throwing your money away.
156072,0,"I got this only because it was cheap. I think it's entertaining to twist, my son does not. It's not real sturdy, seems like it would be easy to pull apart. Sometimes it's hard to get the ring to twist, but overall it's not a terrible toy, just not a real exciting one."
59517,1,"This is the handiest device I have seen. When we first brought our baby home, I have this attached to the pack'n'play. Our pack-n-play had a bassinet and changing table attachment. It fit nicely on the pack'n'play and held all the essentials.We have since moved the diaper depot to the upstairs changing table where we have the wipes warmer. It is a very useful item and I recommend every new parent get one."
72403,0,"the straps aren't very good for a small tv, i used four straps for my son's room for his TV, When i pulled the tv towards me the back straps came off!! the awesome thing about the straps is that they're great for keeping cabniets closed!! since i have cabneit doors without knobs these straps work awesome!!"
78356,1,Everything snaps into place and it's very portable. My son did better with it after 6 months of age. Handy for trips away from home.
50596,1,"I loved this pillow except when it came time to turn in bed. I agree it's like a wrestling match.think I may have wacked my husband a few times with it to. Lol Other then that I totally loved it. I found i got more support when i folded it in half and hugged it with the other side reminding me not to sleep on my back. Also great for people with back problems. I have had conic pain in my back and watching tv with my hubby was nearly impossible without paying for it. Once again with the Snoogle folded in half kinda like a horseshoe, it gave me much comfort to enjoy movie night again! Unfortunately our new dog took over my original one and we are expecting baby two so here I am to buy another. Happy Snoogling!"
149675,1,"The Lil' Doll High Chair and matching cradle were a great hit as Christmas gifts for my grandaughter, age 2 yrs. 8 1/2 mos. She loves both, and two months later still plays with them daily. Her sister, age 5, also likes them; and the parents say these KidKraft toys are easy to assemble, sturdy, and attractive The cradle can be used as a magaziane rack by the girls when they are too old to play with dolls. I bought these because the white KidKraft table and chairs at my house are sturdy, easy to clean, and look great after 6 years of weekly use by one or more grandkids (boys and girls, ages now 2,3,6,and 8)."
172120,1,"My 4 Month old LOVES this tub. After trying 3 other tubs we are sure this is the best. The ""sling"" holds a tiny newborn securely, then, as the baby grows you can use the tub in the reclining position and finally in the sitting up position for your toddler. This is a terrific product."
133465,1,I like these bottles. My son does not get gas and they are bpa-free. My only caution is when using the Dr. Brown's microwave sterilizer. Several of my bottles got deformed even though I used the recommended amount of water and time for my microwave. I decreased the amount of time the bottles are in the microwave from 5 to 4.5 minutes and I have not had any problems. (Hopefully that's still long enough to kill the germs.) I know Born Free sells their own sterilizer so maybe that would work better.
105416,2,"I hate it!!! It is a horrible product that in no way keeps the diaper smells in. It worked fine for the first couple of months, but the diapers barely stunk then. Shortly after that, it started really stinking, I'm talking about stinking up the whole back of the house! It stunk even when it was empty! I tried cleaning it many times with bleach and changed out the gaskets twice!!! After 8 months of stinkiness, I threw it away!!! I bought it in the first place because it had good reviews and got a good review in a book"
177699,1,"I bought this set so I could pump a couple of bottles here and there so I could leave the baby for more than an hour at a time. I never expected to pump 3oz in 5 minutes the second time I used it! I was astonished to see the bottle filling up with so little effort on my part. The pump is easy to assemble and use and it is very comfortable as long as its positioned on the breast properly. I would recommend the Isis to anyone, even those needing to pump more frequently than myself. This is a great product!"
19980,1,The set of three bowls are very colorful and appeal to the child. Love that they have lids that stay secure. The bowls can be used anywhere. Great for a 8 month old and up!
107292,2,"I bought this product based on reviews in ""Baby Bargains"" and also on this site. At first it worked well- no major problems. It smelled when you opened it to change the bag- but what container storing dirty diapers wouldn't? After about 2 months of use, the smell got bad. I had been changing the bag frequently, cleaning it, airing it out outside, and finishing that routine with Lysol. However I could smell the thing in the hall outside of my daughter's bedroom. I changed the bag, cleaned it, etc (see my usual routine above) and it still smelled. It wasn't even open!To make an even longer story shorter- I bought the Diaper Genie and found that all of the ""reasons"" that I didn't buy it in the first place (refills being costly/annoying) didn't even apply to me. The refills are about $5 and are available at all of the stores that I go to on a regular basis. I've used it for about 2 months now and I can't smell anything, unless I'm emptying it and the bottom is open."
121975,1,"I bought this stroller for my newborn and 2 year old. I am very happy with the construction and quality of the stroller...is very well made and durable. It also looks quite stylish. However, it is very heavy and quite large. It is a great stroller if you will not have to lift, fold and unfold it regularly. The sun shades are large and protect little ones from the sun better than most. The storage basket is large as well and should meet the needs of most parents. The versatility is great and it is very simple to change the positions of the seats. It also handles very well and does not seem heavy while you are pushing it. It manuvers easily. Overall, it is a great stroller...just wish it were not so cumbersome."
148372,0,My son who is 2 really liked it at first and would sit in it while reading. When I tried to get him to sit in it without his clothes on he hated it since it was hard plastic. When he got up after less than 5 minutes his bottom had a really dark red ring around where he had been sitting. It just didn't work for us.
143647,0,It is small.May be I don't use it. Don't know whether to use. But feel like the quality of this brand is good
19475,1,We tried this cup when my daughter was 9 months old. She just couldn't master drinking from this sippy cup or any other. We finally used the Nubi cup for a month and now she is 13 months old and does great with this cup. This is the only cup we use now.
48445,0,"First, let me say that my biggest complaint about this product probably could have been avoided with more research. We have this system plus the additional camera so that we can monitor two children. The system does not have a scan function (or any means of monitoring the two cameras simultaneously). As a result, it doesn't meet my needs.Otherwise, the picture clarity (even in a completely dark room) is pretty good especially for the size of the screen. The audio is also very clear. We do get occasional interference which is really loud static and a temporary loss of picture (wakes me up at least 1-2 times per night!). Previously, we had a standard audio monitor and had very few problems with any interference so I'm not sure what makes this unit so sensitive. Overall, this is something I expect with a monitor so it wasn't surprising.The camera feature has provided us with more ""entertainment value"" than I expected - our toddler is a acrobat in bed!"
65237,1,"I agree with another reviewer. This is a necessary companion to the glider. We initially bought the glider from a Babies R Us store, but were disappointed when the ottoman was out of stock. We used the glider for about a week before the ottoman we ordered off the website arrived. The ottoman makes the glider so much more comfortable, especially for short people."
42046,0,"This stroller reminds me of a old Porsche I once owned. No frills, lightweight, no cup holders, but performs very well.Pricey=yes, you did not expect all of the above at a bargain price, did you?The unit came packaged well as most Britax items that we have owned. We used this initially as a convertible car seat as the Britax Companion infant seat snaps out of the SUV and right into this unit. Everything worked great and both units attached themselves with no issues with only two simple pull levers.Once our little baby grew out of the infant seat we switched over to a Britax Marathan (highly recommend) car seat and these do not snap into strollers (due to weight and size) and we had to use the included baby seat for this stroller. This is our largest complaint as the baby seat that comes with this stroller is as simple as a cloth bucket seat. The cover has very poor sun coverage and we find ourselves often placing a towel over the top to prevent the sun from hitting our baby's face while outside.The cover just does not go up enough to do it's job unless the sun is behind the stroller. There are also no provisions for snapping on additional blankets, covers,etc to extend this protection.Now the seat can attach either front facing or rear facing which is convenient and is very lightweight. The unit also folds down with ease for easy storage or travel. While fully open we can easily pop it into the rear of a Lexus GX470 without collapsing it. SUV's or cars with shorter ceiling heights will need to collapse the unit which only takes seconds and then this unit is only 12 inches tall.The unit can also collapse with the seat attached which is convenient but and then is around 20"" tall.Large oversize wheels add to the stability of the unit while adding an aggressive look to the stroller.There is a basket down below for storing a bag and is sizable enough to carry a diaper bag +whatever you need for one baby.There are no cup holders though which can come in handy during outings. Aftermarket units are available.Comfort wise the seat is very well made though a bit thin. This does two things; 1) Does not get as hot as other baby stroller seats which is a plus, 2) Does not offer as much cushion as other strollers. So ,it is a trade off of one or the other which requires Mom and Dad to decide which is more important.Would be purchase it again? For an infant convertible stroller-yes. As a baby stroller using it's included baby seat=iffy.RecommendationsAdd further sun protection to this unit. Even if it was a snap on blanket to cover the entire unit for sun protection. This would really add to an otherwise great stroller.Add 2 cupholders-would not impede on the weight of this stroller.PROSVery modern,sleek. Well made aluminum stroller. SEXY!Very lightNice convertible stroller for Britax car seatsFolds down very flatReal air inflated tires for a great rideFront wheels lock easily with oversized locking tabsPlenty of bottom storage for one babyCONSPrice-but you get what you pay for. Pay for a Chebbie and you get a Chevy. :)Very poor sun control cover=our largest complaint.No cupholdersLee A. DyeSimi Valley,CA."
179835,1,"REALLY NICE GIFT FOR A SHOWER OR AFTER BABY IS BORN, THE OTHER REVIEWER IS CORRECT, THE POEM STUCK ON THE FRONT OF THE BIBLE IS MORE FOR A GIRL AND IT JUST PEELS OFF ANYWAY. COMES IN A NICE BOX."
135643,2,This package looks like it is from 1980. There is nothing about BPA free on this it was made so long ago. There is no way I would use these on my girls.
86371,1,"After plenty of research, this product was worth all the time and money. It really helps to know whether you should enter the baby's room without waking the baby beyond the ""point of no return."" Just leave the monitor on low and keep an eye on the sound bars/lights. The huge advantage is the button on top to turn the video monitor on and off while the sound remains on. This conserves the battery. Many reviews are critical of the battery life but I surmise most people don't know that a battery needs to be drained to about 2% before charging again. So just remember not to charge it until the battery low indicator light (another plus) turns from green to red. The one con is the price but we got over the price after we realized what a great tool this is to have."
8286,1,This is a great little gate (for the price) to keep out small dogs. It suits my purpose of keeping the dogs out of the kitchen. They are more afraid of the noise of the gate more than the gate itself. I don't know if it would be safe for a young child. I know my 2-year old great granddaughter could possibly push it over or try to climb it!GMI Guardmaster II Standard Wire Mesh
59418,0,"This caddy holds what I need it to hold, but it does not fit over the edge of my particular baby crib- the lip on it is too small/narrow to fit. I wish that had been made more clear in the description. It does not fit all cribs!"
124438,1,"This cart cover works great for my 7 month old daughter. It has great coverage on the cart and fits large carts like Sam's club. I love that it has the pockets for Bottles, diapers and whatever else I need to have with me.It has a safty belt that fits around her middle to help keep her up right. This is nice since my daughter can not sit for long periods yet without support. She likes the animal print. I hook one of her toys to the loops on the inside so she has something to play with while I am grocery shopping. I would say the only down fall is how large it is when all wrapped up. I would recomend this product highly."
26192,0,My daughter kicks the paws around and &quot;adjusts&quot; it herself when it moves. When she's not &quot;kicking&quot; the thing about I'm able to see her. It's a great all in one concept. It just needs improvements.
72921,2,"I should have known better when I read the only review for the item and it was not a good one. However, the picture showed it to be really cute and compact, so I decided to give it a go. When I got it, the flaps wouldn't stay close completely and the legs are very flimsy. It was definitely not worth my time considering I really didn't expect much--just a simple compact booster seat that I can carry wherever I go with my nine-month old. The seat barely fit her. I returned it immediately and decided to go for the discontinued Fisher Price Healthy Care in pink--definitely worth the price."
131928,1,"I love that I can put the car seat into the frame. And the swing works just fine and soothes my daughter. However, it seems a tad weak and I worry that when my daughter gets heavier, it won't swing as well. Great value, though. I'm happy that she's in her car seat while she's in the swing, because I know she's safe."
83346,1,"I thought that I wanted to add cereal to his bottle to help him sleep better. With this nipple, and maybe I didn't make it thick enough, the flow is very fast."
141144,2,"I have mixed feelings about this toy. It's so good in theory, but after my 7 month old has played with it for two weeks, I'm beginning to hate it.Good things:- Lots of buttons, lights, songs, sounds- The barn door...LO loves to open and close it- Phone..another favorite accessoryBad things:- Batteries...we've replaced them twice already, and he's only had the toy for two weeks!!- Lightweight/not sturdy - he can pull himself up usually, but not on this toy. It either tips forward (on top of him)and ends up tackling him or once he has gotten up on his feet, the wheels push back and he face plants into the ground. Either scenario is not pretty.- No brakes - I realize that this is supposed to help with the first steps, but it would have so much more function if there were locks/brakes on the wheels. LO loves to play with it while sitting, but if he pushes it too hard or swats at it, it takes off backwards and out of his reach. And as mentioned above, when he pulls up on it, it then moves backwards making him fall. I wish there were some way for an adult to change the toy to mobile/immobile to make it function better for a wider age range.We received this as a gift, so I'm not going to worry about returning it, but had it been my own purchase, I'd be looking for a replacement."
136319,1,"We decided that it was time to get my almost 4 month old daughter Brynn an exersaucer because she loves to sit up and take her surroundings in. After reading every single review posted on every exersaucer known to man, I was completely confused as to which one to buy. Almost all of them had good things to say, but there were a few negatives as well. We finally decided the best thing to do was to take my daughter to Babies R Us and let her choose which one she liked best. We put her in the Sesame Street one, she liked it. We put in her the circus one, she liked it. Then, we put her in this one and she LOVED it. (Of course she loves the most expensive one)! We made the purchase and took it home. I was so excited to let her play in it, that I sat right down and started to put it together. About an hour later, I had it all set up. It's always a plus to me when a 23 year old girl can put it together all alone! My daughter is able to turn herself around, hit the toys that are not quite in her immediate reach and bounce up and down. I feel bad when it's time to take her out because she cries!!!!! This exersaucer is great because when she gets sick of the toys that come with it, you can buy new ones! Her favorite time of day is when she gets to go in her exersaucer and watch the Red Sox games on tv. Finally, we can all eat dinner in peace because she is so happy in this exersaucer. We love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone!!!"
49045,1,"Nice product with the ability to add more segments to enlarge the play area. Performs as expected and I would buy again.Two points, however:*Difficult to rotate the fence joints. I almost feel as if I am going to break it when adjusting the configuration.*Fence has small plastic fins on top of the rotating joints that I expect are intended to keep it from sliding on carpet. In transit, the end of the box was hit and some of these broke. Not important enough to go to the trouble of replacing, but I always like to see new purchases in perfect condition."
45673,1,"My 7 month old has used this every day for almost 4 months, and he still finds it entertaining!Positives: Whether my baby is lying on his back or on his tummy, or sitting up beside the toys, there is something for him to do! I have especially loved how you can add other toys to the gym. I've attached Lamaze toys to it without any problem. It's also easy to move from room to room.Negatives: The music always sounds like the battery is about to die, and when the music is on the Nursery Rhymes setting, you don't have the choice to let the rhymes cycle for several minutes. The rattles in the hanging toys sound very weak. The legs on the monkey weren't very springy at all. The parrot doesn't sit upright on his perch."
42524,1,"I really love this sling. Its very comfortable and secure. My 5 month old loves it. It may get a little hot for summer time especially in Hawaii. I wish they had a smaller size for petite women. There's a lot of fabric to go around my 5'2 frame. Other than that, this sling is awesome. It doesn't hurt my back or shoulder like the babybjorn."
82548,2,"We own two Recaro Young Sport car seat and for the past year we have noticed that on both seats the foam liner on either side of the head rest is crumbling apart.We notified Recaro about the problem and how it may be a safety issue.Their resolution to this problem was to send us two replacement foam liners and instructionson how to hot glue them (Yes, they want us to use hot melt glue) in our home. I am not makingthis up, I have email correspondence from Recaro North America customer support stating thatthey will not take the seats back and that the only thing they will do is send us some foam linersand have us do the work on our own.This is suppossedly a high quality german car seat manufacturer and when I read their resolution to this issue I was in total disbelief. In essence what their telling us is that yes you do have a faulty head rest system and we should do the repair on our own >> On such a safety conscious industry this hardly seems like a proper method of repair especially since it's hot glue and we're not experts at taking the seat apart and doing the repair reliably.DO NOT BUY RECARO CHILDREN CAR SEATS!I am in the process of submitting a child safety complaint to the NHTSA so they can take action on this manufacturer.I hope this helps those that are trying to decide on finding a safe and reliable children car seat.Oscar"
21131,0,"I have been using the bedtime lotion for a few years now, both on myself and my babies. I LOVED the soft lavender/chamomile scent and the moisturizing properties were wonderful!Unfortunately, J&J; has gone and fixed what wasn't broken.... they've replaced the wonderful scent of the original lotion with a ""new & improved"" version which is just horrible. It's now perfumey and literally stings my nose when I smell it. I hate it on myself, my husband hates it on me, and I can't stand it on my babies.This is a huge disappointment, and I am frantically searching stores for old stock of the original lotion.So beware when you go to purchase the new & improved!"
18816,2,"Lets cut to the chase with this unit.Pros:- Compact, fits through most all doors and is ok for shopping- Great Sun Shades, you can flip them all the way forward to the point where they are resting on the lap of the child and fully covered.- Deep storage pockets under the seat.- Cup holdersCons -- You must have a smooth surface or the stroller is a bear to handle. If your sidewalks are heaving, bumpy or being encroached by grass and dirt, you will have difficulty moving this stroller.- NOT FOR POWER WALKING AT ALL - TOO HARD TO CONTROL- Tall people (6"" plus) kick the center back wheel when walking- Handle is too low for the tall people (again 6"" plus) you have to slouch- It is not agile at all. You must put forth effort to turn sharp or quick.- One side is narrower than the other- 5 point harness is difficult to adjust. It fits too loose for our daughter who is small framed. Yes, it holds her in but only loosely.- When folded, it is still large and a bit heavy for the smaller framed people of the worldI would not buy this stroller again nor recommend it to any other parents For the money any jogger is the way to go with a twin umbrella stroller for shopping or travel if the jogger is too large to come along."
90586,0,"I have been buying pampers since they gave them to us in the hospital, just because they have been fine and I dont want to mess with success, so I dont have anything to compare to. But lately my son's poos have been getting more, er, powerful, and we've had countless overflows/explosions out the back and occasionally around the legs. My 7-month old son is 25 lbs so the size 4s should work, but recently I've been less than totally satisfied with their performance. Fortunately he's eating more solid food these days, so his poo stays put, but these diapers are no match for that milkpoo."
127988,1,"I've gone through quite a few bottle brushes during the last 9 months since my daughter was born. I just discovered this one, and I'm really bummed out that I didn't find it sooner.This is the perfect bottle brush. It has a sturdy brush, a comfortable grip, a wonderful suction cup at the bottom to keep it where you want it, and a hidden nipple brush that is sure to be kept away from germs when not in use. This brush is well-made. Unlike the others I've purchased, I can't foresee this one breaking. I wish I'd had it when my baby was born.This brush is worth the price, because you will most likely not need to replace it, and it makes one of the less exciting tasks of parenting easier and quicker."
42414,0,"Very nice fabric..beautiful color. A little difficult to get on yourself. I ordered it to use in the airport which backfired because they made me undo it and take it off...keep in mind this wrap is like 10 feet long and I am by myself! It also get really warm inside so if you live in the south like I do, then dress your baby in lighter clothing."
60208,0,"This tub is a drowning accident waiting to happen!The first time we put her in it, my husband was bathing her and the water was up to her belly button. The tub is so big for a little baby like Isabella that she immediately slipped sideways and ended up face down in the tub. My husband was practically holding onto her when it happened.Needless to say it freaked us out a little, but tried it again the next night, this time with Mommy in firm control and without reckless husband!This time she reached forward for a toy and slipped right over the small barrier in front of her and ended up face first in the water. I actually had my hands on her when it happened.It took us weeks to get Isabella happy to take baths again.Needless to say, we returned the item and bought a small chair for her to sit in.I think it may be good for a larger child who has a bit more control over their body, but I absolutely cannot recommend it for an infant in the sitting position.We bought it because our baby Isabella had outgrown the sink and we wanted to be environmentally conscious and not fill up the entire tub for her.We had high hopes because of all the great feedback here on the board. The tub has a spot for infants to lay in and then a spot for them to 'graduate' to and sit up. Great concept, but just didn't work for us."
113626,1,"After getting tired of cleaning our fabric covered full size high chair, I opted to order one of these. I had reservations, afraid my 1 year old would topple over and not be secure enough but it's great. It attaches securely to our dining room chairs and is SUPER easy to clean..you can throw the whole thing in the sink and wipe it/spray it. I love that it's portable and we can takeit on vacation, to restaurants, and weddings/showers/birthdays, etc. where there may not be enough high chairs. I'm super pleased with the purchase and wish I would have made the switch sooner."
174005,1,"We bought this swing when our son was three months old. We received the Ocean Wonders Take Along Swing as a shower gift and we loved its compact size and portability, but we wanted a full size, stationary swing as well. The idea of the back and forth and side to side motion plus the cozy looking papasan seat really appealed to us, so we decided to spend a little extra and get this swing. (We did look at the Ocean Wonders version of the cradle swing and just liked the look of Nature's Touch better.)For a while, our son seemed like he would never sleep through the night. For several months this swing was the only thing guaranteed to put him out and get him to stay out for several hours at a time (always supervised, of course).He's turning one year old in a week, and we have another baby on the way, due March 8th. I'm sure we'll be putting this swing to good use again."
162828,1,"I love this product - it's been a lifesaver for our household, as our 1-year old twins love to walk around the house with snacks, or take them in the car/stroller with them. They have figured out, however, how to hold open a portion of the lid while shaking snacks out - so it doesn't entirely contain the snacks, but it's much better than giving them an open container of cheerios, which they are bound to dump on the floor."
180765,1,"Our daughter loves this gym. The minute we got it, I set it up and she's loved it ever since.Pros:- TOYS: All of the toys that come with the gym can be moved around. Our daughter definitely has her favorites. She loves the monkey and the bird that rattles. The elephant that rattles is also something she'll grab at and watch. I know another reviewer said the way the mirror is positioned your baby can't look at themselves. We found this to be true also, but we were able to move the mirror from the place it comes in when shipped to a different position and the problem was solved. Now our daughter can stare at herself without me having to angle the mirror towards her! There are also extra rungs so you can purchase and attach more toys of your choice. We've added a bug that vibrates when pulled and a butterfly that chimes. Also there are attachments on the mat itself so when our DD is on her stomach she can play not only with the ribbons and tiger tail but whatever toy you would like to attach to the sides.- MUSIC: The music is great. It plays ""row, row, row your boat,"" ""friar Jack(sorry I don't know how to spell it in french),"" and some other tunes I don't know. It also will play nature sounds in the middle of the songs or has a setting specifically for nature sounds. The music will also turn off after 20minutes to save battery life, which after daily use for 2 months we haven't had to change yet.Cons:- The mat is really thin. I probably never would have noticed but we have all hardwoods in our house and there is not enough padding for me to be comfortable having our little girl on it. We put it on a rug to give her extra padding especially when she was just learning to lift up her head. When she got tired she would just bang her head down and the mat is not padded enough for this!- I thought the mobile with the butterflies would spin but it doesn't. Maybe it's supposed to, but it's too tight. I know there's a setting for the music to start up whenever she bats at the butterflies but it doesn't ever work because she'd have to grab them and tug pretty hard.- The mat doesn't pack away easily, so be prepared for this to take up some floor space.- This is neither a con nor pro but a clarification: I thought the leaves would move up and down just like i thought the mobile would spin. They don't. It doesn't bother me but it was something that I probably would have wanted to know just so I knew more about what I was purchasing.All that being said, I really would buy this mat again. I just didn't think with the cons it deserved 5 stars. Maybe I would try another floor gym out for variety, but I'm not at all dissapointed with my first floor gym purchase!!"
146763,1,"This is the third time I've given this scrapbook as a gift. It is a great keepscape whether the mom-to-be scrapbooks or not. When I give the gift to a non-scrapbooker, I fill in the book with pre-made pages. All they have to do is put in the pictures."
12073,2,"Not helpful once I really got big. Actually, once I got showing at all it didn't help. I am not comfortable in any position."
98618,1,"This is a nice car seat but way too large for my Mazda 3. Too high and too deep, nearly touching the front seat unless the front seat is pushed very far forward. I returned it for the Britax Marathon and it's the perfect size."
56463,0,"We couldn't use these covers because our stove knobs have to be pushed in to light the gas stove. The backs on these cases are flat and have a small opening for the peg to go through before you reinsert the knob. If you have to push your oven knobs in to turn on the stove, this will absolutely not work. They seem to be made of pretty sturdy plastic and they shut nicely. I was looking forward to using them, but we're just going to have to remove the knobs after every use, and keep a closer eye out for hands that turn up or down the heat when the stove is lit... They would probably work well on an electric stove, since they don't have to be lit."
160798,1,"These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total."
36504,1,"I purchased this specific item for my two and one-half year old grandson.He is one who chooses to just take off whether in a store or in an amusement park.My daughter has almost lost him a couple times while shopping so needed something!!!She had heard about this item but couldn't find the special animal....COW.My grandson is in love with ""COWS"".I just went to this site because over the years have been very lucky finding certain toys,books,etc. :-)My daughter tells all her friends about this item, where it was purchased and all the choices.My grandson does not mind wearing it.Will work out great when we all go to the Zoo and Parks this summer.Thanks again for carrying all the best toys,etc for children.A grateful Grandma and Mom.:-)"
113491,1,"I love this chair so much it may even replace my regular high chair! My 5 month old likes sitting in it, it is easy to use, and very easy to clean.I highly recommend it!"
163741,1,We dont have alot of room so this was a must. It fits on most anysize chair. We take it everywhere when we go to a family function. I have the tan one but it is the samething. The pattern is very cute. good for a girl or boy. REALLY easly to work and wash. I actually dont have any padding on it right now since my son like to put food under his bum and save it for later. LOL!! I get a surprize all the time. The ajustments are really easy to do. Its also really easy to clean. I think every toddler mom should have one.
90997,1,ships fast.Better prices than most stores.I purchased the open box diapers and had no problems. The box was a little damaged but nothing major
6303,1,"I'm not sure why this is getting such bad reviews. I think it has an excellent picture and sound quality. I was hesitant to purchase it due to the awful reviews, but received it as a gift and I am so glad I did. The image is very clear (even in the dark)and I can hear the littlest sound. It was easy to set up and use. I have no complaints and recommend this without hesitation.11/30/2009I am editting the review to add to it.I continued to love this item. Worked great for two years. Just after two years the monitor stopped getting a picture. The audio still worked on the monitor and the extra hand-held receiver. I would still recommend whole-heartedly."
4915,1,"I prefer to use cloth diapers & wipes, but for the daycare I use Seventh Generation products. Our baby's been pretty fortunate in that she doesn't get many rashes with either diaper. But, I highly recommend Burt's Baby Bees skin creme for any rashes. It works wonders without the sting."
65236,0,"Much good has been said about Idil Biret. She's just not my cup o' tea.She has a lot going for her, I'm sure, so it's just a matter of taste,I suppose. I've heard a lot of complimentary things about her frommusic teachers, so I had to hear her for myself. I was expecting anice touch, some fluidity in playing and a nice turns in phrasing. Ididn't hear it."
157993,0,"I love the concept of the monitor, but it has issues. I have slept so much better with this monitor in the house, but we had to buy a second monitor to hear sound in my daughter's room. The second night we used this monitor the parent handset went crazy and started giving out a high pitched squealing. Nothing we tried would make the squealing stop. We read a review where the guy kept using this monitor but went out and bought a second monitor to hear the alarm if it went off and if the baby cried. This is what we decided to do. Even though we ended up paying double the price for the convenience of this monitor I would not get rid of it. I get up every night just to double check that it is on. It has given me a great piece of mind knowing that my little one is safe."
98670,1,"Very durable, attractive seat !!! Definitely worth the money !!! We feel very secure knowing our little one is safe with this seat !!!"
20002,2,"Very disappointed! Bought these when my twins were 10 months old and even when I suctioned them onto their clean high chair trays, they could easily pull them off! Now we just use these bowls as tupperware for their leftovers. Very disappointed."
97931,1,"Despite the multiple parts, this bottle and the Dr. Brown's Bottles were the only nipples my daughter could comfortably take! The bottles are attractive, they are true to their promise in decreasing the amount of gas that gets into baby's tummy, and we've had nothing but good experiences with this product for the past year!"
166847,0,"After a few uses, the flexible straw fell off of the top disk that is held in place with the bottle cap. It won't stay in place if put back on wet. Once it was thoroughly dry I was able to re-attach it, and it has stayed in place since, but it has to be watched."
146448,1,"LOVE this for our little girl. She enjoys bouncing around and loves that she can turn all the way around in the chair to play with all the toys but also to face Mommy and Daddy when they walk to a different part of the room or into the kitchen. I work from home and this has been wonderful for entertaining her while I'm working. Great purchase, easy to assemble, worth every penny."
28465,1,I bought this chair because it looked like it was compact and I was not disappointed in that fact. It appears to made of pretty good quality and looks nice in the living room. It was not bought for a baby rocker but my 7 yr. old grandaughter loves it.It is not an overstuffed chair by any means and the one downfall is the seat cushion should be thicker. I have only had the chair for a short time but I would give it 4 stars. Amazon delivered the chair via UPS within 5 days at no charge. It was easy to put together and I am an older woman. Thumbs up
64448,1,I needed a gate that allows me to keep my small dogs out of a room but short enough to step over and to allow my disabled cat to get over. The gate is perfect. It is secure in the door which allows my disabled cat to land on the top and then go over. It could be stained to match any wood type or painted. I no longer bang my shin on the gate when I step over yet my dogs can't jump over into the room. My only complaint is that the pin to latch the door is cludgy.
2798,1,This was great for when the baby was small and having many feedings at night. We had one upstairs and downstairs (got two from shower and just kept). We formula fed and still found it useful. We havent used it much to have him sit in it but it is nice for our son to lean on his tummy with. The softness of this one does exceed the others with regular cotton covers and this has a removable cover which was key
170262,1,Received this as a gift from my parents. Can't wait to use it. Mom is waiting for my wife to call her and give her critique after our Daughter's first night's rest. Very sturdy and durable looking.
167031,1,"We got this seat in a different color for our first baby. We feel very secure with it. Easy to install and a little hint, they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars... you don't need it, you can fasten the seat without the base. the directions for it are on the seat.I like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it, and that it's transportable to our stroller. (bough seperatly) It comes with a head ""brace"" whatever those things are called to cradle the head. Those never do anything, and are pretty useless, but the seat itself is great."
175570,1,"HALO is truly phenomenal! You may remember my HALO Comfortluxe Sleepwear review I wrote a few months ago, in which I mentioned that I'd heard great things about the Halo SleepSack but hadn't actually tried one, well...now I have!Every new baby needs one of these! Sometimes I put my baby in a onesie and just zipped her up (she has since outgrown it). She slept so well, and so did I, knowing she was safe. The sleep sack is fleece and zips like a sleeper. The arms can be placed across the chest in the arm pockets which velcro on to the chest, or not wrapped up at all.It is especially important to properly swaddle to prevent suffocation and hip dysplasia. Here is some info on Hip Dysplasia, if like me, you've never heard of it.HALO's SleepSacks and Swaddles are the only products on the market approved ""hip healthy"" by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute.It's no wonder that they're the #1 choice of hospitals! These blankets are also great for transitioning babies from swaddling to arms free sleep. Great and safe baby gift idea!See my full review on my blog [...]"
169964,1,"Two hundred bucks seems very reasonable for this much solid wood, all of it well cut and drilled. The Emily went together without any trouble, though give yourself 1-2 hours. With respect to the guy who claims he did it in 25 minutes, that's possible if you've got help and have put them together before. By yourself it's trickier to keep components properly placed while getting them together. Give yourself time and do it right. You'll be pleased. It's very solid and looks great."
91103,0,"I have tried this carrier since my son was born and now he is six weeks and I still cannot use it. It does not seem to work for babies who cannot yet hold their heads up. The back of the carrier (which goes behind their heads) is super high and since his face is buried in my shirt, it does not allow for a lot of breathing room at all. He gets frustrated and cries every time I put him in it. I will try it again later and see if I have better luck."
126334,2,I love the protection this diaper offers. We got our first shipment and everything was perfect. I was so excited to find such a deal on amazon.com. Then the second shipment came and the diapers pretty much fell apart. It felt like gritty sand and this substance was falling out of the diapers. It would be all over my son when he'd wear them. There was one diaper that the insides just fell out when I picked it up. This may have just been a fluke but I went through each diaper and had to throw away nearly the entire box. The Disney pattern also stained his onesies.
124101,1,"I tried out the Kwik Cabana I as well as this one. They are both a cinch to put up. The number II has a better amount of room. I would not get the number I for the reason that you would outgrow it too fast. II seems to be spacious enough for two or three years at least. The only slightly annoying thing is the bag could be a bit bigger, as it is hard to stuff it in. (folding down, however, is very easy.) The breeze comes through nice and low for baby lying down. And very private for nursing, changing, etc. The ""lip"" might keep some amount of sand out."
59001,1,"This isn't quite a review, for I have a couple of weeks til my baby is due. I received this sterilizer at my baby shower and was quite excited since I did register for it after seeing all of the great reviews. Here is the problem, or question, I need answered...I was going to sterilize bottles and pacifiers when I noticed that my angled VentAire bottles don't quite fit right..and then on the back packages of the nipples, it says not to put nipples in dishwasher or sterilizer. Is this true?? Will it ruin the nipples? I hope someone can respond and let me know if it will be of use or if I should return it. I am confused on what to do!"
132089,1,I put it up with funtack . That way it does't ruin the paint. My grandson loves it and that's the goal.
20460,1,"These are great nipples! We have been using them for our little girl for just over 4 months and they work great and show no wear whatsoever. Dr. Brown's makes a high quality product and as a bonus they fit and work with our Born Free bottles, too."
121258,0,"I love the ""non-baby"" colors of this bag. After two other babies, I was ready for a bag without Pooh, bunnies and pastels. The brown & pink were great colors that went with everything I was wearing (as opposed to all the other bags that just coordinated with the baby!)The ONLY draw back that I've found is that there isn't much ""Mommy Space"" in this bag. There are two small front pockets that don't hold much and certainly aren't secure enough to hold a wallet or cell phone. The only other space is a zipper pocket inside the bag, which is just a pain to get to when you need something quick.Overall, it's not a bad bag, but I would look for another small bag for shopping or quick trips... this is definitely an all day out, only baby stuff sort of bag."
93222,0,"I got this for occasional use (sleep overs, trips etc.). It is true what others say, about the support section in the middle, which is raised. This can't be comfortable! I wanted something easier to haul around than a pack'n'play. I would say you have to put some folded blankets on each half, that way it evens out with the middle. It's a great idea, but not well thought-out. I won't return it, just because I'll use it may be twice a year, but if I was to use it regularly...definately I'd return!"
96638,2,"The stuffed animal is super cute but it's not as practical as I had hoped. It has several noises and I thought one of them would be similar to ""white noise"" which is what I use at night to help my baby sleep. Not crazy about the sounds."
97711,1,"I'm an organizer and this bag is perfect for everything. I don't need to carry a purse when I use it. I agree the main compartment could be a bit bigger, but other than that it's great."
65771,1,All I can say is that I love it. My daughter loves it and the greatest part about it is that when she starts to sit up we can put it on a table top and keep it in use.
126253,2,"I dont remember diapers that left my kid wet before. These diapers leak, almost every time we change our daughter. Not sure if we got a ""defective"" batch, but so far these diapers are consistent for leaking....."
73863,1,I put this on my registry and received it as a gift. It was one of our most used items in the first 8 weeks. I have to say that now at 2 months we use it alot less. Maybe because baby is in a growth spurt and I am just feeding constantly lately.
153284,2,"We bought this clock for Christmas and enjoyed it, even though it has a loud tick-tock sound. After my daughter complained that it was keeping her awake, we moved it from her bedroom to the playroom. That worked out fine until I needed to change the battery. While the back cover was off to replace the battery I bumped the round dials, knocking something loose. We have tried to put it back together but it still doesn't work. So, it was cute for 7 months - but a waste of money.Be careful to not touch the clock's inside parts while changing the battery."
47063,1,"I love this stroller.PROS:- It fits in my Mazda 3 trunk, as opposed to many other strollers.- It is light.- The older kid (2.5 years older than the baby) likes that he is riding like a ""big kid"" and can hop on and off any time (any time I let him to).- The stroller had car seat adapter.- It is really short! So you can maneuver in stores and restaurants. It goes smoothly on pavement.- I'm 5'8"" and it's comfortable for me to push.CONS (why I do not give it 5 stars):- The seat for the baby is not the most comfortable available in the market. I mean it is comfortable alright, but I saw more luxurious ones on other strollers.- I have to remove the canopy and the tray in the front in order to put the stroller in the trunk. The ""buttons"" you have to push to remove them are hard on my fingers, so I have to use a car key to push them. I guess I have to get a different car :D You do not have to remove them if you are putting the stroller in Honda CRV."
180407,1,"Just got this bag via Amazon, first I LOVE that it's a messenger type and not flowery or pink. Maybe I'll change my tune as my baby gets older, but I've seen friends/family lugging around a whole house-full of gear/toys/clothes/blankets/food for their kid in massive diaper bags, most of which they never seem to use - I have no intention of doing any of that. This seems to hold what I think I'll actually need, a few diapers, wipes, a bottle or two, change of clothes, a toy, my wallet/keys. Only annoyance so far is the cell holder, considering how many people have smartphone/iphones now I can't understand why they would include a holder for a flip phone. I also don't love the changing pad, it doesn't fold as nicely as I think I'd like, I want to pick up one of the wallet-style changing pads that are more compact and fold nicer. All in all I see this as a perfect urban bag."
131048,0,"This product was a few inches too small for my baby's crib, so I wasn't able to use it as intended. Even so, it is a solid item and easy to clean."
22541,1,"My first grandson isn't here yet, but for the price, this is one sturdy, convenient piece of equipment. My son has seen it, and was impressed, even though the one on their registry is much more expensive. This is for me, though, and I think it will be great and last through many babies. The directions were difficult to figure out(just illustrations), but I eventually got it together, and I'm really pleased."
47991,1,"My baby loves this basket! It's roomy and well made. The reason I got this specific basket was because it advertised sturdy handles for portability, but when it got here there was a note attached to it to not move baby around in it. Other than that, a great moses basket!"
181035,2,Disappointingly missing 2 of the 5 hanging toys. The 'baby activated' lights and sounds do not work. Overall a disappointing purchase.
37307,2,"Save yourself time and money by not ordering any products from Stork Craft. I ordered this dresser from Amazon, and it was at my door in two days. Sadly, one of the side panels had a MAJOR spider-web crack in it. I followed the instructions and called the company. I spoke with a representative, and set up an order to be shipped a new panel. A week after the order, I had not received the confirmation email (they said processing time would be about 3 business days). I called the company back, and they had still not processed my order. I made them process the order while I was on the line to make sure it would be done. Almost 3 weeks after the initial phone call, the replacement panel arrived with another spider-web crack, and with 3 of the 5 metal drawer rollers flattened against the wood.I called the company a second time, and was then treated very unprofessionally. They treated me as if I was a liar, stating that every piece of furniture was ""thoroughly inspected"" before being shipped out for replacement. However, it seemed hard to believe being that the packaging the panel came in was it great shape. Even the thick bubble wrap lining the part was still in tact. The defects in the panel must have come from storage, so it seems they have a very poor inspection requirement. The representative even forced me to email pictures of the damaged second panel before they would ship me another replacement. After this long battling, I tried asking Stork Craft to ship the panel with a quicker method. My son's due date was then about a month out, and I didn't want to wait another 3 weeks for the panel to arrive. They refused, and the best I was able to obtain was for them to process the order with me on the phone, trimming my waiting period to only be 2 weeks before the replacement arrived.When the 3rd panel arrived, I had very low expectation, and rightfully so. The panel had blemishes, and a large scratch about 6 inches long on the outer face, from one of the corners towards the center of the piece. I realized that this was the best I was going to get. I just tried to hide the scratched area of the dresser in my son's room with other items so no one would notice.The dresser itself is very nice. The color is great, and seems very sturdy. I am satisfied with the product (or well, I would be if I had one that did not have any defects). Save yourself the anxiety, don't buy from this company. Or, make sure to buy from a store and inspect the pieces before you take them home."
42404,1,"we really love this carrier. it's extremely versatile as it has many wrapping styles, which are shown in the booklet they provide. we've only used 1 style so far, but i suspect as our child gets older, we'll be using many more. we've also got the ergo and the baby bjorn, but haven't needed it yet. when our little one is cranky, the only thing that seems to sooth him is this wrap and a walk around the block.it's great since it frees up both hands, but yet it's not too bulky. i'm able to eat dinner with this on.really easy, very comfortable for both the carrier and the carryee. i highly recommend this!"
60614,0,"I bought this for my sister for her baby shower and it's a good product. You can find babies on one end where it's smaller and toddlers on the other end, which is larger. The only drawback is that it is quite large, so unless you have alot of storage space in your bathroom or nearby, it may be a bit of a hindrance. Needless to say, my sis has a very small bathroom so not sure how much use it will get."
15280,1,The pink valance matches my daughter's bedding and gives her room a pretty girly look.
15069,1,"I bought this for the piece of wood. It was the perfect size for us to attach to our wrought iron railing(with zip ties) and then pressure mount our gate. I spray painted it to match the railing, and it looks great! Yes, it is a darn expensive piece of wood (since we discarded the rest of the items), but for us, it was easier measuring, buying a piece of wood, and then cutting it to fit. This already fit for us...just had to angle the edges a bit!"
2190,0,"I have used this from size2-3 for half a year. It has been pretty well for the baby until recently he reached 20 lbs. When he pooped, it seemed that the diaper can't hold it any more and we had to clean the clothes for a few times. we did not have a problem with our daughter who used 3 for a long time. But it seemed that this one is not a good match for baby boy. I am going to try size 4."
5439,0,The sides tend to collapse inward making it hard to put any trash in while driving And hard to find plastic bags the right size to line. They should make a plastic removable liner.
75465,2,"First, ours was defective. The cross-bars hold the floor mat open in one direction (left/right), and inside the floor mat you place plastic pieces that hold it open in the opposite direction (front/back). In ours, the way the hooks and loops were sewn in, there was no way to install the bars to keep everything open. The bottom of the cross bars not being held open, mean it was pretty easy for a baby to collapse this.This issue also meant the plastic portion which is filled with water could easily be grabbed on or rolled onto by our baby. That got me thinking about how safe a squishy, water filled, area of plastic would be for our two month old. Once she starts rolling over, she could easily get face down into that plastic portion. If she were playing there, I would be worried if we were to turn our back for a few moments. I'm a new dad, and pretty paranoid for my daughter despite the fact I survived childhood. But this was enough to get me to return this."
111185,1,"I love the cloth and the ability to see the baby when breastfeeding. However, if you have an active baby like I do she tends to move the cloth and the coverage is not there. The material also shrinks a little if you put it in the dryer. Overall it is a great product though and I tend to take it everywhere I go."
130615,1,"I LOVE this swing. I have a 13 week old daughter and I think that as a first time mommy, this series is a must have if you can afford it. Yeah I know, it is a little pricey but it is a lifesaver when baby just wants to be amused but you have to cook,clean,etc. Riley has loved this swing since the first time we put her in it at about 2weeks old. She has the take along and we are getting ready to buy the highchair. I saw one reviewer didnt like that the leg is lifting up because when it is swinging, Riley is about 15 lbs now and we have no problem. The legs are meant be as staggered as they can be to provide stability and prevent lifting up. The fish mobile and the swing itself have been used non stop virtually since she came home and both work fine. Sure it eats batteries but buy rechargeable, they are a very good investment. Hopefully this product will still be available when I have my next child in a couple years!!! I absolutely love the swing..THANKS A LOT FISHER PRICE"
48986,1,"My wife and I bought this product for our 8 month old son, who regardless of how much we baby proof still manages to get into everything. It wasn't expensive at all compared to similar products. Our son is a big boy (24 lbs 26 inches long), and we were afraid that he would hurt himself by pulling up on it, but it seems to stand just fine with his weight. WE needed the peace of mind knowing that he wouldn't get into something dangerous while we were washing bottles, cooking dinner, cleaning house, ect... We're so happy we bought this, you wont be disappointed!"
28222,1,"I bought these training chopsticks when my son was two years old. He was able to pick up food and eat with them on the very first try. The orange plastic guide piece ensures that the chopsticks are held in the proper position, making the chopsticks an extension of your child's own fingers. I didn't even have to explain how to use them! Now, my son (not Chinese, and only asked to use chopsticks occasionally)is seven years old and prefers loose chopsticks like the grown-ups use. I credit the fact that he can do this to the Combi trainers. I've subsequently bought these for his cousins as well.Our two pair have held up very well - no signs of wear. I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher, which is great. You can remove the guide piece for an intermediate level trainer, but the guide had taught him well enough that we went straight from that to adult chopsticks.It is rare that you find a product that is well designed and actually does what it advertises. The Combi trainer chopsticks are definitely one of those rare gems."
34645,0,"I have this set and although it's easy to use with my Medela pumps (electric and manual), I rarely use it unless all my bottles are full, because you can't see the top of the bag to know when to safely stop pumping without overfilling. Thus I can't pump as much in one session as I do with storage bottles, unless I stop and change out the bag. You end up only filling each one 2/3-3/4 full and use up more bags this way. I do love the drop-ins system and that's what I use to feed baby when I'm away from her, but I pump into bottles, not into this set."
45879,2,"ohai my baby doesn't stare at this because it does not move.If this spun it would probably get more attention, also she hardly lays awake in her crib where it is mounted at all, this could certainly be the issueIf your baby is frequently awake and stares at things that do not mechanically rotate this for you."
153929,0,"I like this product and oredered a subscription. It was a little more expensive than the leading brands, but I didn't mind paying a slight premium for the environment friendly factor. But now the company significantly downsized the packaging from 80 count down to 70 count per pack. On a 12 pack that's 120 less sheets. In other words, the previous 12 pack became a 10.5 pack, with no decrease in pricepoint. I cancelled my subscription because a small premium for environment is one thing, but a ripoff of the captive audience is quite another."
61877,1,"My son is 17 months old and has been in these for nearly ten months. We switched to these because he does not like to lie down for diaper change. These are great because we can just pull it off and throw another back on, easy up! I like these over Huggies because Huggies sides dig into his skin and make abrasions."
39268,1,I purchases 2 and then ordered another 6. It's an adorable album for a baby boy. The price is reasonable. There are not many baby boy albums out there that are beautiful like this one. I absolutely love them.
44858,1,in my opinion there is no other pump out there that can even compete with this one. in addition to its compact size it is perfect for an on the go mom.
7581,1,"We had not registred for this but a friend who saw that we were registered for an ""infant"" car seat (that pops in/out of base for carrying) said that this was a must have. In terms of portability - it is very light and very manuverable (can steer with one hand). Once assembled - it is very easy to set up and get the baby in/out quickly. Makes trips to the store easy. We returned our other stroller once we received this as a gift. We will be sad to see it go when our son grows out of his infant car seat."
63145,0,"SO, first two months this thing was great, but just today the tensioner broke leaving exposed screws on the box and not allowing the lid to stay open. Very disappointing. Unfortunately we are out of the warranty on this thing and can't return it. Very very upset about this. Beware, I read a lot of reviews on this and decided it was still worth buying, now i'm kicking myself!Edit: KidKraft is sending me replacement pieces, we'll see how that goes...moved up to 3 stars"
123152,1,"I bought this playpen for my one-year-old grandson, who stays with me 2 or 3 days a week while his parents are at work. This is a good size, giving him plenty of room to play. He loves the toys on the inside of the sides, especially the crinkly butterfly. Sometimes he goes over to it and looks in, then turns to me, asking me to put him inside so he can play. He is very happy when he's playing there. It was easy to set up. I haven't taken it down yet, but I think that will be easy, too."
46518,1,"This was the only gate we could find that was compatible with my son's captain platform bed (though we had to put a piece of plywood underneath because you can not use this with slats.) To be honest, I never tuck it under so I can't speak much about that function, but it is sturdy and substantial."
184630,2,I bought two of these sheets and they are both in the garbage having ripped in the first few uses. The sheets we have from other companies are doing fine.
31663,2,"This brush was a waste of money. I'm debating writing to the company. The sponge part started falling apart after only a few uses! I couldn't believe it. The brush is not long enough to comfortably wash the skinny 8 oz. bottles, so your palm will be sore, you can't even get a good grip on it."
92910,1,"I purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib. I was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots. So in figuring this would also be good for travel, I bought it. My son loves it! The whole thing is like a mesh beach chair. I put it together in about 8 seconds. The removable fitted sheet that comes with it -is soft. The entire thing is easy to wipe clean. It looks comfy. It says it is good for kids up to 75lbs. and 52 inches. (Good to know) My favorite feature is how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared to other cots. Not nearly as bulky, too! Nice royal Blue colors!"
34635,1,"I wish more people knew about this storage system. It is so convenient - pump straight into the liners, twist on the caps, and store in the fridge or freezer. Once the milk has frozen, pop off the caps, pop out the liners and store them in freezer bags. When needed, just pop a liner back into a nurser and it's ready to go. The bottles heat quickly and easily in hot water. It's so easy to clean the pieces - just soak in hot soapy water for a minute and rinse. I bought 4 or 5 storage systems - I can bring 4 caps to work, send 4 bottles to daycare, and have several bottles stored in the fridge or freezer. My son, almost 5 months old, has had no problems bottle-feeding with the Playtex nursers and the NaturaLatch slow flow nipples. Highly recommend!!!"
33002,0,"too bulky and it makes the car seat narrower than it should be. or maybe it's just that our car doesn't have enough space between the car seat and the front seat for it to work correctly. so intead of using it to level the car seat, its just there to make sure the car seat is leveled correctly so i don't have to keep checking."
48857,1,We have a large living room and wide multiple doorways so this is the perfect way to keep our little one safe. Much better than getting a bunch of gates which our older son would be unable to open. Love it and I'm so happy with the price $51 and delivered free to my front door. You can't beat that! I love Amazon!
117939,2,After less than a dozen uses it broke. My friend has the same product and she said hers broke too. I would not buy again.
182830,1,The hospital introduced us to Huggies Newborn and they are just perfect for a newborn baby. We couldn't be more happy with them.
15893,1,"I'd purchased JJ Cole Head & body support, JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite and recently I'd purchased JJ Cole Urban Bundle Me + JJ Cole Diaper Pod.I got the best deal on Amazon for the JJ Cole Urban Bundle Me as I paid $30 that too free shipping. I'd purchased the Head Support + Bundle Me Lite from Babies R US and it was a total waste as I had to pay full price along with shipping.The reason I gave 4* is kz it does take a little more time to tuck the baby . . . However, overall it is a good purchase for the price I paid atleast . . ."
125243,2,"My 3 month old is chewing on everything and needed something to soothe his little gums, He is now 4 months old and the raspberry is HUGE! It takes up his whole mouth which im affraid of, since it gags him. hahaha"
183811,1,"I love this set and use it a LOT.. However, be careful when ordering from Amazon! I ordered it wanting the bright multi-colored package that is pictured and I ended up with a package that only had blue, orange, green and yellow.. Ugly colors!"
182520,1,My son had a lot of fun placing these stickers on the wall. It gave him a lot of pleasure to move things around and place things exactly where he wanted them and would see them when he woke up.
103998,1,"I'm a first time breastfeeding mom returning to doctoring at 4 weeks post-partum. I have found this pump easy, comfortable, fast & effective in producing 6-8 oz/10 minute pumping session, and convenient to use with the Avent Breast Milk storage bottles and Microwave Sterilizer. The Newborn nipples seem to be working well too when Dad feeds her. I learned that the best suction is generated when the parts are damp & warm (fresh out of the sterilizer)--otherwise the red lights come on the pump & the suction is weak or stops. Customer service was helpful with troubleshooting this problem, too. They also told me that the pump parts, with proper care, would last several years; however, I am contemplating ordering spare parts just in case one fails during my workday."
60133,1,"I love this tub! it is very large though so if you live in a small apartment it may be a little cumbersome. Newborns slide around a bit, but you should have a hand on them at all times anyways. I have the mint colored one and it has been through 2 children so far and is still like new."
143414,0,Bought this for other than it's intended purpose but have not had time to try any modifications yet. That's why the 3 stars.
17097,0,"We bought this video monitor after our daughter turned one. I didn't think I would need it with having the voice monitor, but it was nice to see what she was doing at bed times.I could also see when she woke up without opening the door and disturbing her.(door closed due to cat)We thought it was great. I like the easy on and off video button at the top and the sound is very clear and loud. It also lit up the crib at night which was kind of nice also. It was just enough light, like a nite lite. The down fall was the clicking noise constantly. So we decided to try the Safety 1st brand($50 more)Wow the picture was sooo much clearer. No constant clicking. Not as easy to switch video off and the sound is not as loud as I would like it to be but for a better picture it's worth paying a little more, plus you have a tv to boot."
153821,0,i got these once when earths best were out of stock and i was looking to safe some money. overall I do not think I saved any because i had to use twice as much. Earths best are still the best and worth the extra money.
162963,0,"The product arrived timely and was in good shape, but the quality wasn't as nice as I thought it would be. I felt the same way about the crib/bedding set, as well. I guess I should've shopped in person rather than ordering items like this online!"
44420,2,"I bought this product in January. I installed it, and would have given it a great review at the time. It was relatively easy to install, looks OK, and seemed safe. However, by about August, the netting began to tear, and the material now falls apart with only the most gentle touch. The product is completely unsafe. Do not buy it."
160903,0,"I love the compartments and the colors of the bag! The camo looks super cool. BUT the material is pretty cheap, i thought it looked like canvas, but it is more of a nylon. Thats my only complaint."
170763,0,"This fit the pack and play very nicely, but seemed thin and scratchy. We only use them at abuelita's house so I'm not sure how they'd handle washing from everyday use."
18474,2,"My 6 week old was having gas issues and spitting up a bit so we decided after reading the reviews on here to try Dr. Brown's. What a waste of time, money, and laundry detergent! For 3 days I tried these bottles and for 3 days he burped more and spit up MORE. We had to change his crib sheet 3 times in one day and his clothes and mine 4 times in one day all because he spit up a large amount of formula. So back to Avent for our little guy.NOTE: It has now been over a month since switching back to Avent and our little guy is doing MUCH better. Sure he still spits up some but nothing like he did with the Dr. Brown's bottles."
24159,1,"I had bought the Savvy Soho by Combi and loved it, but my son looked very squashed in it. I ordered this stroller and have been very, very happy with it. It is light and folds very compact. It is very easy to steer, and rides very smoothly.there is also a large basket thats holds plenty of items. I highly reccomend this stroller!"
155688,1,Great purchase! I take it everywhere and my daughter likes it. Better than go to a public bathroom. She's two years old and fit there perfect.I highly recommended!
60149,1,"Reasons we love this bathtub:1) The tub is deep enough and large enough to fit most of the baby's body underwater so she doesn't get cold, yet the angle of the body support keeps her mouth/ears out of the water.2) The tub is very big, so we won't need another one later on. It's small enough on the infant side to hold our 5 pound baby girls, and the toddler side is definitely large enough for a MUCH bigger baby.3) The molded body supports cradle the baby to make her feel secure, and they keep the baby from slipping around. We put a hand towel underneath for some cushion & softness, but the tub design is fabulous all on it's own.4) The tub is VERY easy to fill, drain & clean. Just fill, bathe, drain and rinse it out. No foam or mesh inserts that can get mold or bacteria.Our twin girls feel so comfortable, relaxed and secure in this tub that they fall asleep during bath time. We have such an easy bath time - it's the most peaceful part of the day. I just wish I'd had one of these for my first baby!"
43902,0,"We borrowed this seat from a friend for our 2nd baby. It was okay, but not the kind of quality and ease of use I have come to expect from Britax. As many reviewers have mentioned, it's *heavy.* I realize this is a trade-off. If you want a seat the holds a bigger baby and is strong and safe, it's going to be heavy. The TSIP head cushions are a nice safety feature, but they are also super-hot in the summer. My little girl was always a sweaty mess. The handle can be stiff. The canopy is not great. It was stiff and difficult to adjust. The fabric feels plasticy and did not hold up well. It has piping going across the canopy in several places to help it keep it's shape. After a while, the fabric covering the piping started fraying and wearing off. The canopy also got several white streaks on it, and I have no idea what from - maybe from rubbing on door jambs? As for the extended weight limits, we found them unnecessary. By the time our kids stopped sleeping in the car all the time (around 6 months), we moved them up into a convertible seat. No one wants to carry a 30lb baby around in a pumpkin seat!!On the plus side, I did like the safety of the TSIP cushions. The seat is deep, and definitely more cushy and comfy than other baby buckets. It has a higher weight limit that the standard 22lb seat, so you should get a few more months of use out of it. Overall, I was glad we borrowed it instead of buying it. We have a Roundabout and a Regent, and we *LOVE* them. This seat just isn't up to Britax's usual standards. We certainly weren't going to buy this seat for ourselves when our third baby came along! I think there are other seats out there that are just as safe, easier to use, and less expensive."
69893,1,This is a great product for a busy mom. They work just as well as the more expensive brands. I love the fact that I can order them online and have them delivered to my door without a shipping charge or tax. They are great!
169734,1,"this chair is the standard design that you see in every restaurant.i am an experienced woodworker that needed this at the last minutebefore Christmas, so i made the decision to buy rather than build one.the design and joinery of the wooden parts is fine- my only gripe isthat my one-year old grandson managed to break the flimsy plasticbuckle the first time he sat in it. the chair was very reasonablypriced; i believe most people would be willing to pay a few dollarsmore if the buckle were to be made out of metal."
74143,1,"I purchased this stroller a few weeks ago when my three year old started preschool. We walk to and from each day and his little legs would get tired on the walk. Now he is so excited to go because he can walk, stand, or sit in his ""big boy seat"" on the stroller. His little sister rides up front and loves to see big bro behind her. She enjoys talking to him in her babble as we stroll. This stroller folds flatter than most standard strollers I've seen. Its really durable, wonderfully made, and has a nice tall handle that even their 6'5"" Daddy doesn't have to bend to use! Huge plus for us!!"
57067,1,"I use this gate at the base of our stairs to keep my toddler from going up the steps. The gate was fairly simple to assembly and I admit, it comes with adhesive and/screws to attach it to the wall and I skipped this step. I have had to take time to readjust it a time or two because of that, but that is my choice and it would probably work better with that step being completed. If I had this at the top of a staircase instead of the bottom, I would definately attach it more permanently. I LOVE the fact that it swings shut behind me. It's extremely easy to open, and has the option to lock or not. To get it to stay open you simply open it wide enough to catch and it stays open so we can use the stairs more freely after he goes to sleep. Assembly gets 4 stars, easy of use would get 5 stars."
16283,1,"I use this blanket at playdates, my back yard and even as a playmat when visiting friends and family. I love how this blanket folds up and can be carried like a purse."
69139,0,"what happened?? pampers cruisers changed their long time staple diapers, and definitely NOT for the better. my son is getting diaper rash for the first time EVER, and they just aren't as absorbent."
79880,0,I ordered this to keep my water cold longer and to take to the beach. I ordered in early June and didn't recieve it untill late July. It did not come in time to take it to the beach even though I order it about 6 weeks in advance. I really haven't tried it out.
4133,1,I have enjoyed this product so much. I have used constantly. It is one of the best Tupperware items I have ever bought.
94461,2,"We registered for the Avent newborn starter set thinking it was the best for gas, spit up, etc. Our son spit up and cried for 2 hours after eating from this system because of stomach pain. We thought it might be lactose intolerance so we switched formula. This did no good, so after doing some research we ended up with Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles. This was the answer to our prayers. Within a day or so the spit up stopped and the crying after feeding subsided. Besides the normal newborn gas...our son is doing much better! My advice to parents is to not register for or buy this complete system...buy a few different types of bottles and see which one your little one takes to. This system is too expensive to buy, sterilize and then not use!"
96431,2,"This lock did not fit on our front or back door levers. It only fit on the smaller levers we have on some of the bedroom doors. It worked well for the bedroom door, but we really need something that will fit on a slightly larger lever for a main door. At this point we are going to buy hook and eye locks until we can find something better."
47086,1,"Awesome, awesome stroller. Just got my ultralight and am very pleased. Seems like high quality material and sturdy craftmanship compared to other strollers I've been viewing in stores. Very light and turns on a dime...fits through small doorways with ease.Baby Carseat Placed in Back:I have a 16 month old, and a newborn due any day. I wanted a tandem stroller in which I could put the baby carseat in the back. After reading two other reviews on here about modifying it to do just that, I took the risk and ordered the stroller. My evenflo car seat sits perfectly secure on the bars for the sit 'n stand. I don't even feel it's necessary to tie it down to the stroller, it fits so well. This is not an approved set-up for the stroller, but I feel comfortable using it this way. You do have to keep the front seat in the upright position...but my 16 month old likes sitting up straight. Also, I am excited about this modification because when my 16 month old is older, she'll use the sit 'n stand and the newborn will be sitting in the front. It's a stroller that can grow with my children and I feel like I'll really get my money's worth out of it.Fits in a Small Car Trunk:I was very concerned about finding a double tandem stroller that would fit in my Mazda Protege. It has a VERY small trunk, and I haven't been able to find any double stroller that would fit it. If you remove the sun shade and snack tray (or carseat holder if using) the stroller folds up much smaller in length. In fact, it fits in my trunk better then my current evenflo aura single stroller!!! And it's not hard to remove or put back on the sun shade or snack tray!!! So easy, they just snap into place (they are meant to be removed).I am 5'11"" and the handlebar is perfect in heigth!!!!! This is a dream stroller, especially for such a reasonable price!"
35473,1,"My 6th month old is too big for the carrier, plus he sits up well without support. This product is great for him, he can play without me having to worry about the germs of the cart, plus the padding is great for babies too. I wouldn't go out without it! Worth every penny!"
51774,1,"I'm decorating my baby room now, and Tiddli Winks' safari collection is perfect for a boy or a girl. I love the bright colors, and the rug is adorable. It is a little small - would be nice if they offered a rectangular rug w/ 2 more squares."
62093,0,"I used to only buy Pampers products, but the quality is diminishing so much that I am now trying other brands. I'm not thrilled with any of them either, but at least I'm not shelling out as much cash for them. My son is long and skinny, and these still do not cover up his little tush. They are too narrow. They are very soft, which I like, and though the sides are harder to open, I prefer them to the Pull-ups, because those come apart while he tries to pull them up! These hold pee fairly well, but if it's ""number 2,"" we have to be extremely careful because it always leaks at least a little out of the sides."
48174,0,"Overall was happy with this product. Honestly, we didn't use it that much, but when we did, it was useful. It was a nice print and nice looking. It came with a manual of alot of different ways you could use it, but honestly, they weren't very descriptive and were a little confusing (for example, the picture they're showing, I'd never have felt comfortable using it that way, but maybe it's just me.) However, for the typical small baby, laying down, it was nice because I was able to carry her hands free while she slept and was covered (from sunlight, noisy people, etc.) After a while, tho, it may start to bother your shoulder, since it's only one shouldered vs the backpack style ones, it did mine once she got around 15 lbs."
24860,1,"I am a mom to Quadruplets and to my suprise when these little ones started crawling at 6 months old, they were instantly everywhere! I had to find the best gate and I had to find it fast!I did a ton of research before making my purchase, as I always do. And chose the Hands-Free Gate by The First Years.This gate is used between my kitchen and living room (high traffic area) and it works out great! You step on the pedal (NOW NEW AND IMPROVED Pedal, oposed to the old model) use your knee to push the door open, kick it closed and that's it!I've walked in and out of the kitchen with babies in arms, food, bottles, the works and this gate has never been a hassle.I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone in search of a good sturdy and easy to use gate!The Pedal requires a good amount of pressure to open, therfor the 3-5 year old's I've had in my home have not been able to get the gate open! So an infant is sure to not open this one!We give this gate eight thumbs up!"
167443,0,I got the nursing wrap as a baby shower gift from my registry. Love how it looks in the picture but when I first used it I noticed how unbreathable the material was. It clearly states on the box that wrap is made with breathable material. It's made of %100 polyester.
41419,1,"I really don't understand the complains about the new Pampers' Dry Max technology. My baby has very sensitive skin and theses diapers are gentle enough not to cause her any rash. I'm a stay at home mom and I change my baby's diapers very frequently and always use generous amounts of Desitin Creamy, so no rash for baby Cristina. Another plus, they are light weighted so they fit better under her clothes and look comfortable now that she is starting to crawl."
156597,2,"I registered for this item and have tried it several times with my 4 month old daughter. She does like it for a while, but I think the music is too loud, the lowest swing setting is actually pretty fast if you have a lightweight baby, and the back is not inclinded quite right. She always looks so uncomfortable. The best thing I like is the harness. It is much better than the Linkadoos Bouncer, it comes up much higher and is not as tight around her middle."
1102,1,I ordered these pampers one day and recieved it 2 days later- awesome delivery! I love how thick and fluffy the diapers are and how it seems to fit just right around my baby girl :) will probably order again due to delivery timing and quality. Even diapers.com didn't have this good a deal!
48237,0,"I received this blanket as a shower gift after I listed it on my registry. I have not used it yet, but was pretty disappointed with the very faded colors (not at all how it appears in the picture on the website) and the real lack of softness (I've received many other blankets that are MUCH softer). It looks pretty tough, though, so I assume it will be durable."
115135,1,I bought 2 of these to keep my infant son off of the stairs when he began to crawl. It was relatively easy to install (You want to make sure you tighten both sides evenly) and did a good job. My only complaints are that over time the closer spring became sprung and would not close the gate and eventually the the plastic stop that is supposed to keep the gate from swinging past the closed position eventually broke. Nothing lasts forever and we did get a good year and a half of service out of them which is what we needed before taking them down.
110493,0,"Do you have smart little ones that can open other safety latches like we do? Our two year old could open drawers and cupboards that had child latches on them. Not these. These are kid proof, and adult proof if you don't have the magnet to operate the latch.They are tricky to install, requiring a precise depth for a hole so you don't drill through your cabinet. Placement of the hole is critical for operation. If you get them installed they work great. The red latch is used to disable the latch but if you close the door or drawer quickly the red latch will pop and enable the latch on its own. They need to rethink the red latch mechanism."
154749,1,I am pleased with this wipe as cleans very well without causing skin irritation. I like the eco friendly aspect and the only complaint would be that they have a funny smell which we got used to quickly and don't even notice now. I think the smell is from no perfumes... in the product and you are smelling the actual ingredients rather than the fake stuff in other wipes. I also bought the 80 count packages to refill my wipe warmer and honestly the package size is not much different so when the 40 counts are gone I will probably only buy the 80 counts as they will travel just as easily.
2686,1,"I love this product, but I have to agree we bought it for 39.99 at Wal-Mart. The EXACT same thing."
172887,1,"We inherited the avent bottle from friends and this transition option is a great idea. We started our son off with the soft spouts without the flange at 6mth. He's just now accepting it (at 8mths) but when he did it was with the harder spouts and with the flange. With future kids, I may skip the soft spouts, because he's not fooled that its a bottle, and go straight to the 'hard' spout."
60876,1,"I think the wide opening Diaper Genie is great.. I have both the other genie worked fine but as the diapers got bigger it was harder to put in the opening....but the new genie works GREAT.. I think the only thing missing is a freshener so when you open it..you don't get an order... I use a stick on kind now and it work.....Thank you, a Proud Grandma"
113034,1,"The name says it all. I bought these for my then 18 month old daughter. She loves them and hasn;t cracked them or caused them to leak. I love how the lip is shaped more like a cup. They are insulated, and have a rubber fitting on the bottom to help with tipping. I have put them throught the dish washer and they have held up well. all in all it is a great cup."
78526,2,i thought it was awesome at first then 2&1/2 months later it stop suking and i could only get an ounce out i used my manual one my babies only 3 months and im without a breast pump
121665,1,"This product is awesome, great quality and very versatile in use... Have used it all the time within the first 7 months - if you are on the fence about this product - try it you will be surprised how versatile and useful it is."
131058,2,First off the pee gaurd comes out way to easily so my son has more fun taking it off and playing with it then peeing over the seat and onto the floor making a LOT of messes for me to clean up. Second when we can get the flushing handle to work the battery wears out very very quickly. Its a MAJOR hassle to change the battery and we finally gave up. Also the lid comes down and annoys my son. He hates it so I finally took it off! Its a neat concept but they should have built it alot more sturdy and just an overall better design.
148491,2,This actually poses a great danger to your child's health. As you try to install it you will ultimately become so frustrated that you will hurl the mirror across the interior of the vehicle and it may ricochet off the dash and bonk your unsuspecting child. If you happen to be one of the five people that can magically attach the crummy strap you can rest assured that it will spring off as soon as you hit your first pothole.Whoever invented this disaster needs to be put in a timeout.
61330,1,"I will buy a diaper genie for every baby shower I ever go to again! This is one of the best things that I was given. I have a highly sensitive sniffer and I do not like bad smells. My daughter is six months old and I have yet to smell an odor in her room. The genie is easy to use if you follow the directions and the refills are not that expensive because they do last for several weeks. Don't go for the cheaper model, it stinks!"
23739,2,"I thought the idea of this was great...a portable high chair that would fit on nearly any table in restaurants, at the in-laws....Well, the first time we used it at the in-laws, the leg wouldn't release from under the table...we thought we were going to have to saw the table apart to get the chair out from under it! We returned that particular unit, and the replacement one still has a leg that is sticky.The other issue with this chair is that if a restaurant table is lighter, your baby will tip the table. Also, tables with any wood underneath such as a leaf or an extension will not permit this chair.If you are looking for something portable, I would purchase one of those space-saving high chairs and cart that to other people's houses. It is easier and more reliable.We rarely use this Chicco product. We end up toting the space-saving high chair instead"
178225,2,"These bags leak! I've used about 10 bags so far, and 7 of them leaked out milk when they were defrosting! :( Please take my advice and get something else instead. Your milk is too valuable to take chances with leaky bags."
153873,2,"My husband bought these because they were cheaper and had great reviews and were good for the environment. However, I quickly went back to using the pampers sensitive wipes when my baby started getting diaper rash. The wipes are thin and just seem a little harsh for such sensitive skin."
103964,1,"FIX FOR THE SHIELDS SUCKING BACK MILK:Okay, I have a week-old girl and I'm a first time mama. Very intimidated by this whole breastfeeding and pumping thing. So the first thing I'll say is that I love this pump. My first comment is to help those having a similar problem with it:Con: the shields on the cones suck up milk. If you lean back at all, they suck up a lot of milk. My husband fixed this problem by smearing a liberal coating of lanolin cream on the top of the shields (where they insert into the cones) and pressing them into place to get the lanolin to act as a glue. This solved the milk-sucking problem.Pro: super effective pump, and the memory feature rocks.Con: it's very easy to mess up the memory setting you're using if your hands fumble (like mine do).Pro: setup, once learned, is easy and quick. The carrying case has a place for everything plus more room for other pumping necessities (cream, box of storage bags, empty bottles, etc.) It's really portable.Con: Lots of parts; but, as mentioned above, once you learn how to set it up and take it apart, it's pretty quick.Pro: very easy to clean. Con: with all the parts, cleaning can sometimes be a pain in the neck.Overall, I love this thing. It's making my life so much easier, and I'm not nearly so afraid of going back to work and losing supply. Also, we chose this pump over the Medela because it got better reviews concerning its useful life, and we want to have more children. Additionally, I found out from a lactation consultant the other day that the main reason the Medela is so popular is that they produce industrial-grade hospital pumps, not necessarily because they're a better product.Get this pump."
130395,1,"It took our baby awhile to warm up to her swing. She wasn't wild about it for her first month, but ever since then she has loved it. The ""cradle"" shaped seat is wonderful for young infants....much better than your standard swings without head support. At four months she uses it often. It's great for rocking her to sleep for a nap. In fact, it's so useful that I have to remind myself to get her out of there for hands-on play more often! My only criticism...I wish there was an option to extend the time that the music plays. The automatic shut-off happens too soon."
157686,1,"This a great invention (re-invention) to swaddle new babies in. My daughter used them for my new granddaughter for a couple of months. The SWADDLING REALLY helped the baby sleep longer and with less startling.My daughter said at first they were difficult to put on but once she got the hang of it they were easier. However, baby grew out of them so fast & I didn't buy very many large sizes.My grandma always swaddled & I was taught how to do it with the old receiving blankets but I was not aware of how important it was and how much it helped babies sleep more comfortably."
120216,1,"I Love this product! Wish Amazon would have put it on the 'subscribe & save' plan. I had limited pumping time (as most of us do) and would have to cut pumping short to take all the parts to the rest room to wash then bring back to the room I pumped in, to put them away. Having these wipes allowed me to pump longer and wipe them down in the same room I was already in, rather than taking everything to the bathroom to wash out. I recommend this to anyone who has to pump outside of the home!"
92242,1,"First, let me point out that this set does not come with 3 5-oz. bottles as stated, it only comes with 2.I bought this set because I was very concerned that my 6 week old daughter would not take a bottle and then go back to me. These bottles are great for anyone concerned about the same thing. I have watched as she drinks from this bottle and she does have to do the same sucking action as required to drink from the breast. Usually I have to give her a little sqirt of milk to she will know what it is I am giving to her and then she'll latch on. I have had no problems with these bottles leaking as others have.The problems I do have with these: my daughter still gets to much milk to fast and they do nothing to keep her from sucking in a lot of air and getting gassy. So, the flow is still faster (as with any bottle) than what she gets from me and I keep a bottle of gas drops on hand after she's had one.Although I like these bottles for breastmilk, once I start giving her other liquids to drink, when she is of age, I will switch to a different brand."
122697,1,"frame is cute. it has real weight to it, so it doesn't feel or look cheap at all. Note that it can only be used for verticle pictures because the images on the sides are set to be vericle."
1166,0,"I like the diapers, except for the fact I had to throw out about 6 from the tab snapping off when I strapped them on. This has not happened with another brand and it seems to be a clean snap as if it isn't attached well enough. I'm going back to Luvs."
21718,1,"We too do not know the gender of our baby and this set is perfect. The animals and colors are soooo cute. I sometimes wish they would make this for adults. :-) I highly recommend this theme for either gender. The quality is excellent. We also purchased the pillow, hamper, picture frame, wall pegs and growth chart to match. The nursery is absolutely adorable."
174449,2,I read all of the reviews at thought that this would be a great mobile. Drove all the way to Babies R Us brought it home and it doesn't fit on my crib. Be warned if you do not have a truly &quot;standard&quot; crib this will not fit. Don't waste your time.
158177,1,"I used a snugli carrier for my baby for the longest which was an inconvenience for a while since my son was born very small, I had to wait until he was a little bigger ( 7 pounds) to use it. This carrier has no weight minimum and my son loves it! He is 2 months old now and people hardly know I am carrying a baby which is good because often strangers will come up to you and try to touch your baby. With this carrier he is facing me and I can cover him up completely and protect him from them and the sun. However, if you are short this will not fit you. I am 5 foot 7 and it fits me fine. I would say if you are under 5 foot 6 it will be too big for you."
51912,0,"I had high hopes about this gate despite some of the reviews from here and others. Some reviews said it was noisy, I was able to open it properly and quietly. It was easy to install. I like the fact that you can have it open and out of the way. However, it is hard to open and close without using two hands. You need to beable to latch the bottom and top while manuevering the lock button. It mostly takes some time because of the top and bottom catch if the catch was made to catch easier it would be a great product. If you need to easlily get to the other side in a hurry, this gate is not for you."
64845,1,"My son is almost 5 months old and has been using this swing since he was a newborn. We LOVE it!! It is very portable, folds up, and doesn't take up much space. The songs and lights are entertaining, and the swing is very soothing for a colicky baby like mine. He even slept in it at night for about 8 weeks. A definite must-have----I recommend it for all of my pregnant friends!!"
157236,1,"I was ready to give up breastfeeding because of how much pain I was in but then my husband bought me the medella pump in style and it worked wonders. I was pumping every two hours the milk my son needed and now my son is four months and weighs 15 pounds on pure breast milk no formula or cereal. He doing great and not once has he gotten sick. No ear infections thus far. This product is easy to use, clean, and store away. Great Product!!"
155524,1,"I bought 3 of these sheets in Ecru and have been using them for almost a year. The color is what I expected and they are nice and soft. The best part is how easy it is to get these on the mattress. I really like how the sheet is constructed. There is a seam all along the sides of the mattress, so it really fits the mattress instead of having to stretch around to fit. I wish I had sheets like this for my bed!"
167169,1,This is a great car seat and I bought it as a gift for my sister in law.
9157,1,"I had this on my registry and am so glad to have gotten it. We took it to the hospital with us for delivery - nice and portable. I like that it uses batteries since my little house has a limited number of plugs and most are used for other things. Eliminating the cord also means one less thing we have to baby-proof as she starts crawling. The light is just bright enough to see baby as she sleeps and the blue color doesn't hurt her eyes like yellow light can. I love that it shuts off after going through the entire CD rather than being on a timer, and clipping to the side of the crib means more space on tables and shelves. I read the review about this player using batteries, but sometimes the type of rechargeable battery used can make a difference in how long they last. Perhaps the batteries were bad."
111914,0,"The Walk-Through Stair Gate is one of the less expensive gates I found when searching for a stair gate. I have been satisfied with the results, but it isn't the greatest quality. Installation was quite simple, and once the gate locks in it is quite secure. However, the unlatching mechanism for the gate can be tricky at times. My whole family has had problems opening the gate at one point or the other. Sometimes when it unlatches, it can pinch your fingers, and you have to get both the top and bottom of the gate in the correct angle, or else it won't open. The same problem arises when closing. You have to make sure the two openings are aligned, or else the gate won't lock properly. I find myself double checking constantly to make sure the top and bottom have both ""clicked"" into their respective spot because it doesn't always on first try. We purchased the First Years Hands Free gate for a different room (not a stairway) and it works GREAT. So simple, easy to install, and very secure. I have found that the metal gates work much better than the wood ones, not only from experience at my house, but at other friends as well. It is worth the money to invest in a better quality gate if you can afford it."
167255,1,"We bought two of the Britax Marathon's in the Onyx when my daughter turned 1, was 20 lbs and ready to be forward facing. She has loved this seat and it has been comfortable for her during long road trips. We are replacing it only because of an accident (my daughter didn't even acknowledge the accident she was so secure!!) that completely disabled my Jeep Liberty. We're looking at a booster now that's she's 4 and over 40"" tall. I would recommend this to anyone wanting safety and comfort."
169529,1,"Exactly what I was looking for--has space for diapers, wipes, 2 changes of clothes, snacks, and even has front pockets that can fit sippy cups. I needed something to hold 3 sippy cups and this fits the bill. And DH isn't embarressed to carry it around!"
148796,1,"I first bought the Snoogle Body pillow and like it. I needed more support for my back and bely--I am 7 months pregnant, so I bought this pillow and love it! It gives the right amount of support for my back and belly that I needed. It is quite large but there is enough room for my husband, his body pillow (my old snoogle) and me with my new pillow in our king size bed. The pillow helps keep me in the side lying position and helps keep me comfortable. This is a great buy!"
57319,1,"I bought this for my daughter and son-in-law to use as a hamper for the baby, but they decided to use it for her toys instead - it's great! She loves looking inside for something to play with, and it's fairly sturdy and holds A LOT OF TOYS!"
47342,1,"I have used this product for 3 years and still think it is the best baby shampoo available. It smells amazing, cleans wonderfully, and does not irritate sensitive baby skin. Works wonders on their hair too! Leaves it silky and smooth without being greasy. Also a little of this goes a long way so the bottle lasts along time. My baby is 10 months and I am just now ordering bottle #2. All the Mustela products are well worth the price!"
151362,2,"I just returned from my car seat inspection for my infant and the fire department people doing it said none of these mirrors are safe because they fly off in a forward crash, which there are also more of with these because people are looking back at their baby."
74340,1,"It was perfect. You could hide it away when you didn't need it, and no one knew it was there. Plus, my son didn't feel like he was going to fall in every time he went to use the bathroom."
173658,1,"I don't know what we would have done without this swing. As a newborn, my daughter would snooze away the day in it. It looked so comfy and snuggly I used to wish they had an adult sized. As she got older she would contentedly spend 20-30 minutes swinging along observing the world and gazing at herself in the mirror overhead - very much appreciated ""getting stuff done time"". She's now 6 months old and though it is getting significantly less use, it still comes in handy (at this age you really begin to appreciate toys that can't be thrown on the floor) especially as a comfortable alternative when a cold makes sleep in her crib difficult. I definitely recommend this product - pricey but worth it!"
89631,2,"This is the worst diaper I have used out of all the different brand of pampers. Just because it is more in quantity doesn't mean it is a good quality. I am not ready to more on yet, so I am giving the pampers cruiser a try before I make a final decision to move to another brand of diapers. I am hoping we can still continue to do business, since I have being using this brand for 8 years for all my children."
85183,0,It was very comfortable the 1st 2 weeks. The pillow started to lose its fullness. Now it feels like there is nothing between my legs. It does help keep hubby away so his tossing an Turing does not hit the baby.
94434,2,"Unfortunately, these bottles contain BPA that can leak into your baby's milk if you heat them. When I found out we immediately switched to Evenflo glass bottles.Otherwise I actually liked the bottles. I liked the wide opening that allows for easy cleaning. I hardly had any leaks, only sometimes when I didn't screw the lid on just right or when the nipple wasn't pulled all the way through.What I didn't like was that they are not compatible with any other breast pump except Avent breast pumps. However, Avent breast pumps never worked for me, so that was a major bummer. I think someone makes conversion kits for Avent bottles so they might fit onto a standard bottle sized breast pump.Why can't they make these in glass or at least in plastic without BPA?"
54104,2,"This is a good enough idea, but it doesn't work. I just got this a few days ago and it does not stay on. It falls off about 3 times a day. If I use the oven it falls off within minutes."
43773,2,"The hands free gate works beautifully. However, when you need to order extentions for a larger doorway realize one extention kit does not give you the maximum 44"" coverage. I had to order an additional one when I realized the error and had to pay shipping twice."
181192,1,"I got this mat using my credit card travel reward points for my daughter. She is 12 weeks old and loves it. The lights on top keep her mesmerized. I like that I can make it play for 20 continuous minutes....so I can put clothes away or clean her room up without having to keep hitting it. She will play for the full time most of the time- which is a GREAT attention span for her age. Therefore it gets ++++ in my book!! It also has a child activated mode where SHE can stimulate the music/lights. Also a rainforest sounds mode-which is great for RELAXING together!!You can change around the toys or add others (I use some of our Tag-Alongs as well)...which keeps it interesting for her.The only drawbacks are that I thought the butterflies spun on their own. They don't.....either the parent or kid has to spin them. It would have been better if they moved on their own like a ceiling fan!Also, it could use a little more ON the mat to stimulate them for tummy time....it really only has a few small things but again- you can add things via some loops. She just doesn't prefer it for tummy time."
128774,0,"I am an exclusive bfing mom, so when it got close to time to go back to work I started working with baby to take his milk from a bottle. I have always used the Avent brand. The nipple is wide enough for baby as to hopefully prevent nipple confusion. But when I tried giving my son a bottle he sucked a few seconds then started to cough. I started to play with the nipple by pointing it sideways and I barely squeezed it and the milk came out quite effortlessly. I also turned it upside down and instead of a slow drip is was a stream. After waiting a few days I tried my son again on the bottle with the other nipple and the same problem arose the milk was just coming out too fast. I ended having to use a different brand entirely. Now though at almost four months my little guy taked this nipple like a champ."
128274,2,"I dont know how the people who like this thing got it to work but my son hates it and won't go near sitting on it. Its too unstable for him, slides on the seat and doesnt fit even our own home toilet. There are no grips of any kind on the bottom so its straight, smooth plastic on porcelain which presents a severe danger to any child trying to use it. The flexibility is great for travel but it gives under my son's weight before he even hit thirty pounds and that freaked him out so bad he started yelling, 'no, no, no!' It was ridiculous. I ended up having to get an extra of his padded 'ducky' seat from WalMart to stuff in his backpack to drag around with us. Less convenient but a million times safer and he'll actually use it. Would never buy this again!"
27774,0,"I'm sure a lot of my feedback is because I did not do enough research, but I was surprised how different the double stroller was from the single stroller of the same make/model. A friend has the single stroller and I really liked it so I thought the double would be perfect. The main difference is that the push bar is not adjustable. As a tall person, the fixed far is a bit low. Also, there is no parent tray, but this really goofy bag that you snap to the handle and it dangles off. There is also no type of child tray, just a bar (to keep them in I guess). I am using this for my one year old and three year old and I thought the bar may be an issue for the three year old to get in and out, but she can climb over the bar with no problems. It is great that the seats are adjustable, but you adjust them with this bungy type thing on the back of the seat, and it is not possible to get them completely upright. With all that said, the swivel front wheel keeps me from returning it. I had a BOB with a fixed wheel and would never get another fixed wheel jogger (and don't want to pay BOB prices for their double, swivel wheel model). It also rolls really nicely, easy to push and seems to give the girls a smooth ride."
177650,1,"I am a first time mom and I picked this pump out because it was the more affordable pump. I wanted an electronic pump but decided they were too expensive. I am glad I did because I love the isis on the go pump. It is easy to put it together once you property read the instructions because when I first got it, i looked at this thing like ""what do i do with this""? You can also get the medula breast pump wipes which allows you to wipe it down without washing it in the dishwasher. As for breast milk storage, the most durable I found were the lansinoh ""my mommy's milk"" bags."
110861,2,"My daughter hated having her teeth brushed. I saw this in a catalog for baby safety items and found it cheaper on Amazon. I ordered it, thinking it would be a great choice for my teething baby.This thing is TINY, like as long as my finger. The entire thing is made out of soft sillicone so the handle is a bit pointless - you can't really maneuver it at all. Once the baby bites down on the bristles, you can't move the thing anyway. It would make more sense if this item had a larger handle so baby could hold it and it wouldn't be as easily a choking hazard.I found it pointless - if this was to clean her teeth, well she was cleaning her teeth just as well by sucking on her washcloth in her bath, or chewing on the edge of her blanket. Also, do know you can't pick color. We received pink - I didn't care as that we have a daughter but another may not be happy with lack of color choice."
53275,0,"This glider is great when you first bring the baby home and when they really don't care about being held all the time. I will say it is super easy to move room to room. It is nice that it pivots so you can have the baby go side to side or back and forth. It is easy to assemble and take apart for easy cleaning. But they do lose interest in it after a few months and you have to buy a swing anyway. But this served it's purpose, it also plays music that my son loved. So it was something that I would buy again."
175460,1,"I've used several different diaper covers, and I have to say that these are the best. I love the fabric coating on both sides of the plastic moisture barrier. I love the way the velcro tabs fold down onto more velcro so that they don't hang on anything when you're changing or washing. After using these for three months straight, they are just now beginning to look ""used""- the binding is beginning to pill a little, but that's IT. I used another brand that began to shred itself immediately. For price, durability, usability, and looks- THIS IS IT, BABY!"
147289,1,"The play yard wouldn't fit in our doorway so every time we want to move it to a different part of the house, we have to take off the change station and pull out the bassinet. other than that, it was easy to put together and has everything you need all in one!"
169321,1,"These sufficiently contained the poop and pee from the baby, and only leaked once or twice. Very absorbent - an overnight's worth of pee was adequately absorbed."
169543,1,This was a gift for my grandson. He is going to be 4 years old but this bag can be used for any age kid to take their things in. Has many compartments and is pretty roomy. My daughter and the grandson like it a lot.
1616,1,This is a great product for the price. I recommend all parents to sign up for the subscription service. I've saved a lot of money. I've searched other website stores and they don't come close to the best offers found on Amazon.com.
87464,0,"I have used Playtex since my first was born (98') and love almost all of their products. The Premium seems to fall short because of the hard plastic instead of the soft like in the original(the premium scrathes easily). I have had several of the Premium crack because of this, you know accidents happen. Their is also a price difference not much but worth mentioning. My advice is to buy the regular, Im not sure why they call them premium the only thing thats new is the type of plastic and the colors of the bottles. All of the benefits of Playtex disposables can be found in the original.And I have to agree with those who say that the bottles with the built in burper are a plus.But there is a solution that I have found in the originals that air will not come back in if you put the cap back on it. Also I have home tested these bottles and the originals last longer and look newer longer than the premium."
72447,2,"I just want to warn all of you that a car seat should not slip if it is installed properly in the car, no matter what surface it is on. In a crash, this pad will not protect your child from the forces of collision. If you are using it only as a seat protector, great, but if you need it to stabilize the seat, either seek help from an installation expert or get a new seat that fits properly in your car. Safe travels!!!"
46395,0,"Easy to fold and keeps the little ones in. Just know that they will soon get big enough to climb, push or crawl under it."
151007,0,This changing table is nice but the shelves at the bottom have off white bottoms (not expresso color). The picture is deceiving. We would not have bought this piece if we knew that because I thought the whole table would be the expresso color. The off-white shelving throws the whole look off. It was however easy to put together.
96182,1,"We recently went on a airplane to see Nana and Pop Pop with our 2 1/2 yr old and 8 month old. We debated whether to bring the car seats being that we had all the other things that we needed to bring. It was the best decision that we made to bring the car seats. It was so easy with the Pac Back. My husband carried one seat and I carried the other seat. The Pac Back made it possible to carry the car seats and still have both hands free. Unlike other products, we did not have to take the Pac Backs off the car seats when we got to the security check. As for the car seats on the plane....both kids were able to sleep comfortably which made the trip a success."
38178,2,"The item is as advertised and is really cool looking, the issue is that when you wind it up it only operates for about 3 minutes, not even close to enough time to put my boy to sleep. I am going to try to find a cheap mobile and harvest the rotator part and replace the one that came with the mobile."
73143,1,"Love it, love it, love it. One of my favorite baby products! The floppy seat goes everywhere with us- thank goodness baby does not have to touch those germy grocery carts or highchairs. I have worked in restaurants: trust me when I tell you those highchairs are never properly cleaned between kids!!!!It's easy to throw in the car, it's washable, and it's cushy for the baby. It also has a zillion little loops on the front to attach links and toys to keep baby busy. It also has a pocket that's handy for a juice cup, pacifier, etc.Couldn't live without it..."
25025,1,"We are veterans of many types of gates for both dogs and now kids, and I am crestfallen that it took us this long to discover this terrific model. It combines the security of a permanent mount with the relative ease of installation and occasional portability of pressure-mounted models.I had two irregular doorways to fill in with child gates so our scootching 13-month old could play safely in the area. For one large opening I used the SuperYard Gate, which is a decent all-plastic telescoping gate with permanent-mounting rails, and for the other I used the First Years hands-free with a single extension. After seeing how secure the First Years was, and how incredibly east it was to install the extensions, even though I'm happy with the SuperYard Gate, I wish I had bought two First Years Hands-Free,The operation is really cool -- you step on a pedal, and knee the thing open. It works in both directions! I was skeptical the pedal was baby-proof, but letting my son (who is the median weight of a two and a half year old) put his full weight on it didn't budge it a bit. The design is also very attractive; nice thin white metal instead of the usual lattice-work plastic on most gates.One comment on an earlier negative review, where the Grandparent indicated their 15-month-old could pull up the foot pedal: this cannot open the gate if the top is properly tightened! (See below). I tried this, and the pedal will slide but not allow the gate to open if the top is tight.I have only a few minor caveats to convey:- when installing it, make sure you follow the instructions and use the little plastic wrench (included) to do some fine-tuning tightening, so that the upper latch is the required distance from the catch (a wrench-width). This is easy to do, and I found that when I tightened it up as the instructions indicated, the good fit of the latch became excellent even with a slightly-irregular-from-vertical door post.- the opening might be a little narrow compared to some other gates; it took a bump or two on my calf to get the hang of, nothing terribly difficult or painful.- the extension might not be necessary if you have an opening that's right on the cusp of the suggested 29-34"" door opening; if you have an opening right around the maximum, I'd recommend installing it without the extension first to avoid having to make a return for a possible un-needed extension. Installing and de-installing the extension, as I noted, is a piece of cake.- this is not ""portable"" the way a simpler gate is, but can be de-installed and re-installed in less than two minutes. Since it swings open, if you want to use the gate in only one location, the portability isn't an issue.All in all, just about the coolest gate I've used."
146936,1,"I didnt want the floor of my house looking like a day-care center so I picked this over the other options. I was specifically looking for EVA foam, colors that weren't romper-room like and the 5/8"" thick variety of foam. Initially I found this on Land of Nod, but pricing here on Amazon was better and no shipping so it's worth cross-shopping websites. My 5 year old and I had a good time putting it together, although its primary purpose is to designate a play area for the 1 year old.Yes she's pulled a couple of the connectors out, but that's going to happen no matter what and eventually telling her no enough times will make her stop (good listener).The product itself is fine. Colorwise the light-green and grey/white are very close to each other. The fit of the pieces, at least the circles are really good. The connectors have small gaps but some of that is because if you dont push the unit totally square, you can have a couple mm of space between the jack (X) shaped connectors and the main square. The corner squares are rounded off. Instructions, if you really need them are easy and have suggestions for various patterns to set up for yourself.As for the smell of foam that some people complained about, there was little to no smell and no residue on the materials as it came out of the box. I have had plenty of product in the house from other places (Ikea for example) where the off-gassing of the glues was strong and took time to go away. This product had none of that.The other reason I liked this was because of the size 4x5 tiles which fit just right into my space. They do sell extension kits if you need it.I have no reason not to give this a 5 star rating."
16189,1,"I ordered this blanket specifically for picnics with a significant other and it works perfectly for that purpose. The bottom is a waterproof tarp-like material and the top is a much softer and easy to clean surface. The blanket is overall very comfortable and fills with air making it reasonably soft to lay on. It's 5'x 5', which is big enough for 2 people comfortably and 4 at a squeeze if everyone is sitting.The blanket is very portable which makes it effortless to pack up -- it has 3 seams on the bottom that you simply fold along making a long strip of folded blanket. After folding along the seams, you'll notice that one side has a thicker chunk of some material hidden in it, allowing you to easily roll it up along the blanket strip. It perfectly folds every time and Velcros tightly into a suitcase-like, easy to carry blanket. (Some reviewers mentioned that, because it fills with air, folding can take some additional time but it really only takes an extra 10 seconds total to empty the air out while folding. The neatness of the feature is well worth it.)I've spilled a variety of juices and crumbs on it that simply wipe off leaving no trail behind. It seems very durable and has a long lifetime, unlike previous blankets I've used that were 2 or 3 time uses before getting too dirty to comfortable enjoy a picnic on. This is an excellent buy if you're looking for some more things to do outside."
140277,0,"This shade does work, but in a wind it blows around a lot. In a strong wind it will blow back and the kids will not be shaded. I bring clamps with me and clamp the shade down on the sides of the stroller, and this keeps it from blowing up."
91490,2,We just pulled it out of the box to try it out and it is HORRIBLE! We are taking it back and exchanging it as soon as possible. The amount of static we were getting was ridiculous - and we don't even have the baby here yet. You could barely here the radio coming through the monitor the static was so loud.
36519,1,It works wonderfully. It came in perfect condition and is great. Loved the speed of delivery too. Thank you very much.
167671,0,"I purchased this set for my 22 month old daughter. I was impressed with the rate at which it was sent to me, however there was a major snag/tear in the bottom fitted sheet. I asked for a replacement and received it within 4 days. However, there was a major stain on the top sheet of the replacement set (one that was visible without even opening the package). I have asked for a refund and will now find bedding elsewhere. Had the product been in perfect/new condition, as the average consumer expects it to be, I am sure that I would have been happy with it. The fleece was very soft and the applications were cute, but I wasn't ready to take that third chance."
135393,1,"We use these to monitor the progress of our laundry. Our washer and dryer live in the basement of our 3 story townhouse. I took apart one of the two listening units just long enough to snip one of the speaker wires. On laundry day we turn on the base unit and set one of the listening units (either the one with audio or the modified unit with just visual) next to the tv and know exactly when our laundry is finished. While our washer and dryer are new, they don't have buzzers. This was a real pain in the buns until we put this inexpensive fix in place. These units work flawlessly for our purposes. Highly recommended!"
182960,1,"When my son was 14 months old, he started to seem interested in the fridge and began to open it on occasion. I came home one day and was tugging on the door, trying to force it open. I was not aware that my husband that already purchased and installed this lock. I was impressed that it stood up to my tugging, and 4 months later that lock is still working great. It keeps my son out of the fridge and is very easy for an adult to use with one hand. It also makes me think twice when I head into the fridge for a late night snack. This is something I will now add to the basket o' stuff i give to people at a baby shower."
163935,1,only problem was getting piggy into its pink container after having taken it out to examine it...cute litle item for my newborn great neice...colors great...N.B....reviews should not require 20 words when 3-4 would do...tb
173627,1,"I love that this swing goes both side to side and back and forth. i like the neutral color scheme, however i feel like if it were more colorful it would hold my 3 month old's attention longer. when she was just a few weeks old she would sit and nap in this swing all day, now she will only sit in it for 20-30 minutes at a time, but hey thats long enough to empty the dishwasher or start a load of laundry !! overall i have been very happy with this swing and found it well worth the money."
156886,1,"I had purchased this saucer for my daughter who is now 6 months old but, was 5 weeks early. With her being so small I am so leary on like everything that I buy because of her height. Everything seems to be to big for her. After I read all the comments from everyone on this and it seemed to sound like one of the best saucers to purchase. I ran out and got this for my 6 month old daughter. Thinking what could it hurt to try it. She has always had tummy time and her swing and a bunch of other toys but, I wanted something that would strengthen her back, neck and legs and this is perfect....... She absoulutely loves this toy. It is very colorful and has lots of toys on it to keep baby busy. She constantly picks her head up to look at everything and tries to sit up better than she normally does pulling herself forward. So, far I have no trouble with any of the toys or the paint problem. It was also really easy to put together considering it seemed like a thousand parts when you take it out of the box; and the folding up on this product is GREAT you can take it along with you anywhere. Doesn't take up much room. I am glad that I purchased this product. I recommend this to anyone looking for something well worth the money..."
147769,2,"I should have listened to the reviews! I am really disapointed with this seat. It's difficult to use, the material is unbreathable and starting to come unstitched, and the smallness of the hood hardly keeps the sun out of her eyes. The seat is just entirely too small, my baby is just over 3 months weighs 13 lbs and 24 inches long is just about grown out of it.My mom has a little arthritis in her thumbs and can't push the buttons on the handle to move it. Way too much money for the seat, but like other customers, I too love the stroller."
136821,1,I have never put up a border so easy! My husband and I had no problem with the prepasted paper adhereing to the wall. All we did was wet the wall paper and put it up. We put one entire roll up without cutting it at all. I was surprised to see it go up without any problems. The edges have plenty of paste to keep them from pulling away from the wall. (Hint: get a laser level the put constistant level line all the way around the room. This makes the job go so quickly!) We painted the room in 2 tone. The top is yellow and the bottom is green. We love it.
83890,2,"These are terrible. They don't really stick onto the table well; the little trough becomes a handle for the baby to pull the whole thing up, and worst of all is that the material attracts dust & dirt like a magnet, so unless you are just taking this directly from washing it in a sink, it will be covered will debris by the time you want to use it. Just bring some cleaning cloths to wipe a table instead."
132533,1,"I put cloth wipes in here, pour about 3 cups of homemade wipe solution in slowly so the wipes soak it up and then plug it in! It keeps the wipes warm and they don't dry out. I do this once a day and save lots of $$ by not buying wipes and also I like that I'm keeping extra waste out of the landfill. The last couple of wipes aren't as warm as the first ones but they are still at a temperature greater than room temperature and that baby likes."
124133,2,Moses basket stand is not well made. There is a plastic border that surrounds the basket. The border cracked in 2 places during assembly. This stand is also very difficult to assemble. Four of the 8 support screws will not screw in all the way. Attempting to tighten them only strips the screws. I would not recommend this basket stand.
24036,1,"Had trouble finding the small breast shields on line. Thank goodness for Amazon. Product was as described, but arrived right at the end of the shipping window. This caused me a delay in my ability to pump, since the medium were too big. Would have given 5 stars if arrived earlier in the delivery window."
96572,1,"I bought this for my grandson. We live in very cold central New York and my daughter loves this. The only thing she said is if you are going to be outside for any length of time you need to put a blanket under the baby. They went to a Christmas parade and when they got home she noticed the baby's backside was cold. Otherwise, it is great for in and out of the car, to the store, etc. She uses it all the time for that purpose but does put a blanket under the baby if they are going to be outside for any length of time and it is very cold out."
37182,1,"Great bag for baby and parent. Very durable, easy to clean and has a look that dad doesn't mind carrying. All in all very satisfied with this purchase"
147373,1,"I just received my new monitor, so I can't say yet how I'm going to like it long term but found something out when setting it up that made me come post IMMEDIATELY.I plugged the camera into my daughters nursery and turned it on channel 3, came out to the living room and plugged in the monitor unit.. and went to switch it to channel three... channel one all static as it should be, however channel two had a perfectly clear image of a nursery, but NOT MY DAUGHTERS!!!! Our nextdoor neighbor has a son, and I was looking at what I'm sure is his nursery... talk about a creepy feeling knowing I was looking into the neighbors sons bedroom (and I'm guessing would be listening to if the happened to be home and in the room) since that means that if they change their channel they will be looking/listening in on OUR daughters nursery. I'm not sure what I'll do next, if I'll keep the monitor and hope they don't change channels or what.That said the picture is amazing, haven't tested it for sound yet... but since I can pick up our neighbors nursery I'm guessing my range will be just fine for our own inside or outside the house.So... great monitor, maybe to great... you decide!"
129058,0,I decided to splurge and buy this playmat for my son. Overall I like it but it's not worth the price tag.Pros:- Very cute- Sits high so baby can sit under it- Easy to set up and take down- Comes with a very handy carry bag.- velcro toys are a nice touch- mat has several texturesCons:- VERY expensive- doesn't come with many toys. For the price there needs to be more rings and toys that hang.- the only way to hang toys down the legs is to use the velcro attachments. the mat only comeswith two toys with the velcro attachment.- toys aren't that interactive- additional zolo toys are very expensive. The zolo mirror toy is $20 for it alone!I wouldn't buy this again if I did it over. Way overpriced.
184607,1,"I use this sheet with the Arm's Reach Co-sleeper. I find it to be quite a good fit. It doesn't wrap around as far as theArm's Reach brand sheets do, but for the price this one is fine. I did the ""tug test"" and it did not come off at all. My baby is now over 3 months old and there has never been a problem with the sheet. I've washed it repeatedly and there is no shrinking or fading."
77983,1,"We've owned this chair for about 10 months and are happy with it. It has a nice wide base and as far as I can tell cannot be tipped over. My 26-pound daughter tries to climb out, bounces around, and generally puts this thing through its paces. Surprisingly, she is a neat eater and I have not had to remove the cover to wash it; I just rub it down with baby wipes every once in a while. I like that the top part of the tray separates, which makes cleaning easier. It does fold up very thin so we can easily take it in the car to the grandparents' house. My biggest complaint is that the locking function on the wheels doesn't work very well. We have vinyl floors and when the baby bounces, she ""walks"" the chair a few feet forward. A minor complaint is that the cup area in the tray is not big enough for an Avent sippy cup, but the tray is plenty big overall. When baby was 4-5 months old she would fall asleep in the chair, so the reclining function was great. Overall this is a very nice high chair."
30085,2,"This item smells nice, but only aggravated my infant more. It is a good concept, but if colic is gas then I wouldn't want something warm on my belly either."
56521,1,"This one is by far my favorite! I have a curious 1 year old, but that's not what prompted me to buy these. I noticed that I and whoever else was passing the kitchen stove would easily turn the stove on with a bump of a hip. Twice this happened where I smelled gas and realized the stove was on but with no flame -- just gas. I freaked out! But due to all the negative reviews, I decided not to buy these! Then one day I was walking in the store and saw these, and on a whim bought them even though I felt they were not going to be good. Well it turns out, they're AWESOME!Don't know what the heck these people are talking about on here!!! Installed them in a minute! They are NOT hard to open for an adult... you certainly don't have to pry them open with a butter knife like one reviewer said. I can open them with one hand. You just press on the gray tab and pull open. I love that they're clear so I can see if the stove is off. When I need to cook on the stove, I simply open one of them and turn the stove on. They simply hang on the knob in open position. When I'm done, I close them back up.Some people mentioned that they melt cause it's plastic. What I do is I remove them if I'm using the oven (which isn't often). And putting them back on is a snap. I don't agree with the people who say these are useless and to just pull the knobs off cause there's that sharp metal piece sticking out from the stove which is just as dangerous for little kids.Bought another set just in case! These are AWESOME!"
113502,1,"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat - blue.This is a handy, easy-to-store booster seat that is suitable for babies from the time they can sit up (5 -6 months) until they are over two.It is easy to clean, safe and simple to box up for storage. This is a perfect item for grandparents or caregivers to have available at all times for their visits from grandchildren. It is also handy for parents while traveling. It has a handy shoulder strap that makes it easy to carry when flying, driving, camping, etc."
30109,0,"Service and delivery product was great - came in the mail in a short period of time. I'm just disappointed that my fussy and borderline colicky baby showed no improvement when I put this on her tummy....still wailing and screaming at the top of her lungs (after trying it out on her more than once).Seems a bit gimmicky to me but I had to give this a try, too bad this did nothing for my little one!"
104276,1,"It does the job, you can barely notice it's there...and it's just PERFECT!! So glad we purchased this! We use it on our banister that overlooks our downstairs. I have 18 month old twins and I needed it for peace of mind....it's great!"
131830,1,Have three kids and all three are in this seat. It goes up to 65 pounds which allows the kids to be in a multipoint harness for longer vice just a strap across their chest in a booster. They are comfortable and easy to install (especially with the Latch connections). Cover is easy to remove and wash. Harnesses are easy to connect and remove. The extra cushions can make it a little tough to tension the harness once the child is in the seat but it's always from the head cushion dropping down so a simple pull upward on the cushion behind their head allows the straps to move more freely.We have three of these seats in our Honda Odyssey and we often move them around and take out depending on our plans.Highly recommend an optional seat protector for your actual car's seat from dropped crumbs etc.
120541,1,"This monitor is the single best baby item we own. It gives us piece of mind and lets us sleep through the night without waking up and having to check whether our 7 week old is still breathing. As we currently live in Europe, we purchased the 230 Volt model which comes with two smaller movement sensor pads rather than just one. They can be spaced throughout the crib, so even though our girl moves a lot during her sleep, it still picks up her breathing. The sound is very clear-we don't have any problems with static. We would buy this monitor again without hesitation."
167770,1,Absolutely beautiful set. My daughter is moving up to a big girl bed and I am going to buy the full size set because I love this and have never seen anything as nice.
25900,0,"Shipping was great, product is just OK. It requires bolts/screws in the wall in order to stay up which I didn't really want but figured I could deal with since I needed a gate ASAP. Product is not as wide as I expected. It is cheap and not very sturdy. It works for what I need it for (luckily I didn't need to bolt it into the wall, it has something to lean on in order to keep it upright) and I guess it's an OK buy for the price, however I think I could have found something aesthetically more pleasing and durable for maybe a few dollars more."
173628,1,"This is a great item. It is easy to put together even when prego and soothes the baby like nothing else. Has been a real life saver. However after 9 months, she's not interested in it at all."
113016,2,Very cheap product. It is made out of cardboard and you have to assemble it yourself. It chips very easily. And it was in terrible shape when it arrived. Very expensive for the quality. I'm afraid because it looks and feels to be very unsafe for a nursery dresser. I don't recommend it to anyone.
179523,1,"These wheels attached easily to our Britax Boulevard. It made our trip easy since we had one for each of our children (ages 2 and 9 months) and we were able to just wheel them through the airport! We have used these a few times and some airlines have skinnier aisles than others. A word of advice would be to always pre-board if you will be using the seats on the plane. That way if the seat doesn't fit down the aisle you will be able to make a couple of trips (one for the child and one for the seat). Otherwise most airlines will allow you to check the seat at the gate. These make it so simple to bring your car seats with you on trips. (You won't have to worry about the seat being abused if checked with the baggage, and you won't have to worry about renting one at your destination). I will be using these every time we travel!"
152636,1,The day before Christmas I set up his bedroom with Thomas The Train stuff.He is a typical little boy. Trains N Trucks! It was easy to put up as well.
63275,1,We bought this after looking at booster/convertable seats at Walmart and Target. We ended up paying a few dollars more on Amazon. But they were in stock here and weren't at either one of the stores we were looking at. It is a little bulky. My son can't buckle himself very well; he can unbuckle though. But it is super comfortable and he can actually rest his head when he falls asleep. We would recommend this car seat!!
71700,2,"Bad design & waste of money. Since there isn't any support in the crotch area, the walking wings tend to slip up under the arms, causing pain. Even if you tighten the straps, it doesn't stop it from slipping. Our daughter was uncomfortable and cried. I wish I had seen the review recommending the Juppy first. That looks great & most of all, supportive & more secure. I'm returning the walking wings and will order the Juppy."
130,1,"I love this baby book. It is a treasure and is the perfect book to document my son's life. It has plenty of room for pictures and places document all of the important details in your baby's life! I should also mention that in the picture, the color looks pink. In real life, it's actually more orange/peach. It's perfect for a boy or girl."
41733,2,i got this monitor for a shower present i thought it would be great with two receivers and a night light. the only thing that was nice was the night light. i live in a mobile home if you know mobile homes the furnace is loud anyway but it didn't bother us coming thru the monitor. but one night i went to bed and turned it on and all i got was static the furnace wasn't running and we hadn't even moved the monitors at all so i wouldn't recommend this to anyone i am in the process of discussing this with safety 1st because like everyone else it waited until the package was gone. i think they should take them off the shelf.
182872,1,"Prior to purchasing this car seat we had the Mamas and Papas Primo Viaggio. We thought because it was Mamas and Papas, the car seat would be well worth the ridiculous price tag but no, we were dead wrong.For starters, the Evenflo Triump is using Latches both on the bottom as well as the top. Second the harness is not easy to remove even by an adult. Third, the cushions are very soft and well placed that our daughter is seated comfortably. Lastly, the price, I mean this one is three times cheaper than the Primo Viaggio but is far more superior. I guess we shouldn't have based our initial selection just by brand name.We will definitely buy the same car seat for next child."
175547,1,"love the gate, but I think the design could use a bit of work. Overall it definitely serves its purpose and for the price you definitely cannot argue. The only problem is that when you go to close the gate you have to physically lift it up and try to shimmy it into the bracket that is attached to the other wall and sometimes this is a bit difficult. It is a very sturdy gate though and definitely serves the purpose for which it is intended... keeping kids out. The other nice thing (and I guess you have to look at this as a positive as well) is that it keeps my older kids out as well. My toddlers are pretty smart and usually can figure something out after watching once and then it's kind of like... well.. why the heck did I do that anyways! However this gate has posed as a challenge to them, which of course, makes me a happy lady!"
21485,1,These corner guards are very similar to ones I had purchased a number of years ago for our coffee table. The last set stayed on for about 2 years until I decided to take them off. This set appears to be identical and should last the same amount of time. Perfect for protecting toddlers and babys from nasty corners on the edges of tables. Easy to put on - just peel and stick!
119713,2,"Sorry guys but I have to say this is the biggest piece of junk I have bought. From the time we plugged it in, it was all static. I went and bought the TV monitor which I love and works great instead. I decided to use the soothing dreams monitor as a light projector for my son. Oh well, it probably took about a week to stop working. I took it back and exchanged since I had no receipt and so far it's sitting in a corner collecting dust. Don't waste your money on this monitor it's not even worth the money"
163743,1,"I am a mom to 4 kids and have 4 different high chairs: the traditional wood chair, the bulky all-in-one, and the sleek Bloom high chair. The fisher price space saver is my favorite for its ease of use and portability. Although not as simple to keep clean (stuff does get under the easy-clean pad) as the bloom, it is still quite manageable. Once a week or so I slip off the cover and give the underseat a quick wipe down with a sponge. You can even throw it in the tub for a spray down if necessary. It is a wonderful place to ""park"" my infant while I am cooking and easily tips back up for my 2 year old when she needs it. I have the tan version. It blends nicely into my modern cottage decor."
169826,2,"we used the changing table for our first child, during the move we had to get rid of it, it lost stability and structure, I would not recommend this product if you are looking to use it for more than one baby. I am on the hunt for a new changing table/dresser combo"
71734,2,"My dad bought this for my 9 month old son who loves to be on his feet and walk or chase around a soccer ball but since so young has very little balance even though he is really strong. After an afternoon of babsitting my dad's back was killing him so he thought this product would be great. My son loved the freedom he got from it and quite literally took off in it, but the problem is that bc it's not secure around the torso it can ride up under the armpits. Once I saw his arms turning purple bc of the blood restriction this caused it went back in the box and was returned. I've ordered the Juppy baby walker which is basically looks like big unerwear with straps so it holds him better without the problems of a torso-only walker. Maybe this would work better with a more cautious walker or one with better balance, but if your kid is like mine and wants to go go go this is probably not the product for you."
154394,1,"These are the only baby wipes we use, and we use them all over the place. The case is perfect.On a note, these wipes are of such great quality, we wash, rinse and hang dry them and they are fluffy little towels. Sometimes we make our own wipes with them!"
163656,2,"I bought this seat for my 9 month old son, but his cloth diapered bum was already too big to fit in the seat! His linebacker shoulders also seemed so squished. Like seeing a pro-football lineman in a slugbug VW! We tried it for 3 meals that day, but he was so frustrated that he couldn't move. We went back to our 1st chair, a The First Years Newborn-Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat. Awwww, room to move! I'm sure this Fisher-price seat is great, but it didn't work for us. The seat was too small. The pad is surface washable only, and the tray is very large and awkward. If you are looking for a great alternative to this seat, try The First Years one."
152897,0,"Once you understand how they work, you can use them quite effectively. I bought two of the Lionhearts for flying cross-country (very limited formula-warming options) with my 7 mo old. I scoured the Web for reviews and found they were 50-50, for/against; decided to give them a try. No, they don't heat a bottle from refrigerator-cold. Yes, from room temperature (such as the sealed, 6 oz. travel bottles of Enfamil that I brought) in about 20 minutes. For car travel, the best system I've found is to insert an already-warm bottle in the UN-activated sleeve; when the bottles are starting to cool, activate the crystals to keep the bottle warm for up to 3 more hours - longer if you keep the warmer itself bundled up in something. Right when you get to your destination, boil down the crystal-filled wraps again so they're ready to go next time. It's really no big deal. It's somewhat easy to trigger the chemicals by accident, so just handle the warmers gently. All in all, these work quite well for what they are -- especially in the absence of ANTHING ELSE out there. Note the zipper doesn't 'quite' go over the top of Dr. Brown's bottle caps."
63511,1,"This mirror does so much for me when I have my baby in her rear facing car seat. I can see her clearly since the actual mirror is so big, and she can see me..I actually get little smiles when she catches me looking in it. Highly reccomend it!"
53822,1,"What I love is the color, quality of the wood and my 4 year old loves using it. My only CON is that although I have assembled almost every piece of furniture in my house (including a giant weight lifting machine) I couldn't get past the screws problems every one is mentioning. I went very slow and steady and still couldn't get a couple of them to go in all the way. The screws stripped and they cannot go in or our anymore. I just turned them to the back so I can't see them. Also one of the chairs had a small crack but not worth returning it for. Other than that I only take one start because it is a beautiful and fancy table set. I have moved it in my office room as it matches all my furniture and doesn't look all colorful little kid like. I work on my desk and she colors in her table. I am very happy with my purchase."
134031,1,"I received the wipes warmer for my shower, and now that Julia is here, I am so glad I have it. It works great, and my little girl is calm and happy when I use the warmed up wipes on her. I am going to buy a travel warmer, too, because she cries when I use the cold wipes."
97918,1,"I started out using Dr. Brown's and found that the nipple flow was way too fast for my son to handle. He couldn't swallow fast enough to keep up with the flow and was getting a lot of air. The Playtex VentAire are the third system I have tried and I love them. You have to make sure you seal the silicone disc tightly into the bottom, which is easy if both parts are dry. They usually come with Stage 2 nipples which are still too fast for my son and he is 3 months old so I purchased the Stage 1 nipples. They give him much more control over the amount of formula he gets and he is able to take a break with the nipple in his mouth, something he couldn't do with the nipple on Dr. Brown's."
13011,1,"I bought this to go at the foot of our stairs, but it was not tall enough to attach at the flat points of the bannister rails. It wasn't wide enough to block the kitchen entrance either, but it was perfect for blocking the doors to ""no kid zone"" rooms. My in-laws used one to block the stairs leading down to their basement. Adjustable and very sturdy once locked in place."
80473,2,Obviously the instructions for this were written in another country. Some words completely mispelled. This may explain why screws and bolts were used interchangably and the parts list did not match with the number of times in the instructions that they told you to use it. (i.e. part B was a bolt and only supposed to have 2 but in the instructions were told to use at least 6 times. Some bolts/screws completely missing. Going to try to return to the store.
27503,0,"I wanted to see the reviews for this. Someone gave me this stroller brand new. I have a similar instep double. It is hard to turn this puppy, it does not seem very supportive or comfortable and it I am not crazy about the safety belt-just one buckle and since there is no front bar or tray it doesn't seem very secure. It is ok to unfold and fold. I like how it is pretty compact when folded. My daughter likes riding in it. Beggers can't be chosers. I am thankful for it nonetheless."
47466,2,"Mustela baby products tend to be seen as middle or upper- shelve european cosmetics. At least I have seen them that way. I have bought and use bunch of them before reading labels for the first time. This one couldn't be labeled paraben-free and contain hydrogenated fat-if it's bad for human beings, does it matter which way it get into our system? And it is made for babies. I will not buy it again. One star for nice ""performance"" in the bathtub, my daughter enjoyed the great and long lasting foam and colour."
90466,1,"This is the first time I have tried Pampers and I was a little hesitant but I must say I am very impressed! I have never had any problems with leakage and they seem to conform to my baby and her movements. I love the stretchy waist band, it makes diaper changing much easier! I will definitely use Pampers again!"
15957,1,"...because it's just THAT good. Instead of spending $$$$ in buying a gazillion baby coats and still worrying the baby's cold, this on-the-go sleeping bag does the trick. It's a lot better (warmer, stays put) than compared to using a bunch of blankets.PROS:-does it's job, keeps the baby warm-very soft, yet material is still strong/resilient-easy to assemble and use-can be used with a variety of systems: fits inside car seats as well as strollers-easy to wash in washer (or just spot wipe if there is spit up)-looks nice/relatively fashionable and not too uglyoverall it's a terrific product! I really wished they had these in adult sizes for our cold cars during the winters!"
87397,1,"We use Platex disposable bottles and Avent bottles. My baby takes both kind with no problems, and did so when I was breastfeeding and had to go to work. Both are good bottles and have things I like. Platex are quick to clean, easy to assemble, have cool design, do not require a lot of storage space and are good for gassy babies. I liked the nipple design for switching from breast to bottle. You have to be careful with the liners. Sometimes if the liner is not put in right, it folds in between the bottle and the nipple assembly and the contents leak out. We had to reassemble couple of times after formula or milk leaked out."
162820,1,This product is perfect for those who are constantly on the go. Both my 3 year old daughter and 21 month old son love to pull snacks out of these cups. It works equally well for cheerios or for goldfish or other small crackers. Fantastic for travel. My only regret is that I did not purchase this product sooner.
44255,1,"Wonderful item, wonderful customer service--I highly recommend Touch of Europe and all their products!"
181302,1,I love this toy. I've used it for my 2 girls and so far there is no show of wear! LOVE IT!!
149753,0,"I read the reviews prior to purchasing this seat. It is true that the seat does not offer much cushion, but I am not worried about that. Overall it is a good seat which will grow well with my child."
171810,2,"My son is 4 months old and has very long legs. So the bump that's supposed to hold him in place, actually makes him more uncomfortable. His legs end up leaning off to each side. Every kid is different, so some may be more comfortable. But I hate this tub. I feel awkward when I'm bathing him in it. And he doesn't look like he's enjoying it either."
10869,0,It is very handy but it stains easily and the stains are impossible to get out because of the material it is made of. I would suggest another alternative.
75200,1,"I didn't want to buy a more expensive pump since I won't be returning to work full time however I can't imagine that the more expensive pumps work better than this. I used the hospital grade pump while trying to get my milk to come in and this works just as effectively. 5 stars all the way, no need to spend the extra cash on a fancier pump."
11920,0,"I thought it was a wonderful idea as a new mom. However my daughter will not put the mesh into her mouth. The handle is a nice teething toy apparently. She really likes to put that in her mouth. I do think it's rather expensive and then to have to buy replacement bags for almost the price of the feeder seems ridiculous. I also don't like having to clean it and the bag seems small for pieces of fruit. You have to cut them anyway. My now 11 month old eats cheese, fruits, etc. cut into small pieces and she's never had a problem. She also eats crackers just fine. It's a great idea if your child will use it so I am giving it 3 stars."
8853,2,"The product had good intentions however, my daughter was quickly able to pull them off then became a choking hazard when she could get 1/2 of it in her mouth. A better choice for corners is the bumper. The bumper isn't as pleasing to the eye, but definately not a choking hazard."
24545,1,"This gate is for baby #3. I have been through many gates and done much research. This gate impresses me. Even though it doesnt wall mount with screws, it is very stable. I was able to install it in just a few minutes very easily!! It is attractive and works very well."
76416,2,"I asked my public health nurse about this before I put my baby to sleep with it and she said that there have been problems with these items. The SIDS alliance tells new moms that there is to be nothing in the crib with the baby AT ALL, no blankets, stuffed animals, nothing. These have pillows that have BEEN KNOWN to become detached and create suffocation hazards. The industry loves new moms because they can market so much useless (and in this case dangerous) crap using the fear tactic and make oh so much money doing it. Don't buy into it.My nurse has been at this for a very long time and works closely with the SIDS alliance and told me that there is no reason for a healthy baby to use one of these but one big reason not to, IT CAN KILL YOUR CHILD. Just a word of advise from a concerned mom. Now that I know, I wouldn't use one and would recommend that no one else does either."
99951,1,This is my favorite diaper for my boys. They are absorbent and rarely leak. They are thin and soft and my boys are comfortable and dry in them. I would recommend them to anyone.
107855,2,"I registered for this pump because I planned to only pump on rare occasions, so I thought it would be silly to spend the money for an electric pump... Big Mistake. This manual pump takes much longer to assemble, has more parts to clean and reassemble, and pumps significantly less milk than the Medela DoubleEase I replaced it with. Granted, there is a big difference in price, but when you're only getting 2 hours sleep at a time, the laundry is piling up, you haven't had time to go to the store or prepare dinner, and you haven't even had the energy to bathe yourself (welcome to motherhood), it seems worth the extra money to me to have a pump I can assemble in less than 10 seconds, get 4 oz. of milk in 5 minutes, and still have one arm free to hold baby."
166821,1,Great for a room u don't want to paint but still want to change to a nursery.
165064,2,"The Pampers Baby Dry diapers seem to be leaking often even after a new diaper has been put on. I changed my son's diaper and it leaked within 15 minutes on 2 occasions. They seem to fit him well and are soft and cute, but somehow aren't effective. I'm sure that it's like many products. They work extremly well for some, but for others, the product does not work."
123949,2,"On our first two (and only) trips out with this stroller, this stroller tipped over frontways. The center of gravity is too far forward and when going over slightly uneven ground, like from pavement to a slightly raised grating or the slight ledge from street to a driveway, the front wheels stop and the stroller tips forward. The only reason it did not completely flip over, with our baby's head toward the ground, was that the rear axel beneath the handle bars smashed into my shins, both times, preventing the rear wheels from flying up."
158852,1,"This is a very nice and useful product. My baby loves to have milk from this bottle. They are standard size bottles with an in ternal vent that releases any vaccum and the baby does not swallow any air. That way, it reduces colic and gas in your babies stomach. He/She is gonna have an easy 3 oz whereas they'd have not more than 2 oz with a regular bottle and cried 'coz of gas problem and taken a long time to burp and then demanded more milk again.Good stuff.. buy it. You'll be happy since your baby's gonna be happy."
126746,1,"Huggies diapers do the job. I mean, consider what they're used for. Who needs the expensive ""supreme"" diapers when they end up in the trash anyway? In all my years of mothering, I have never seen the need for supreme diapers of any kind, any brand. These Huggies Baby Shaped diapers keep my daughter dry, and she loves the Disney pictures on them. And what could be better than having them DELIVERED TO YOUR HOUSE FOR FREE???? This subscription service is so convenient and easy to use that I have started recommending it to all my friends. I love getting quality diapers for a cheap price and not having to chase around for the right store with the right price, right size - in stock. Gas is just too expensive. Plus, I no longer fill my cart with bulky diaper packages, when I need that space for groceries for the rest of my family! Thank you amazon.com for making my life just a little bit easier."
181497,0,"In the description I read: ""Fits any Graco SnugRide infant car seat"". It went into the car quite easily and strapped in no problems. But the Graco Stylus travel system comes with a Snugride30 carseat which does not fit/lock in this base. So be aware before you buy this."
56156,1,"This gate is used at the top of our stairs so our 19 month old won't attempt to walk down on his own. So far it has been efective in that but it was time consuming to install it. One time since then I opened it up and the actual gate poped off, I placed it back on it's hinges and haven't had an issue."
53924,2,"i just want to point out that the seat is FLAT and HARD,it doesn't sit up very much and the strap is too small for a 2 month old. also my baby screams when he is in it, because it is very uncomfortable. i recomend the baby papasan bouncer or the swing version. actually or just about any bouncer. my baby has and likes: infant to toddler rocker, aquarium take along swing, baby papasan seat, aquaruim bouncer and papasan swing PLEASE DONT BUY THIS IT IS VERY UNCOMFY FOR MY BABY AND EVERY BABY THAT HAS COME TO PLAY GROUP. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
162050,2,"I am a first time mom and tought this tub would do the job. The sling was very helpful in the first couple of months and it is easy to throw it in with the wash for cleaning. My complaint is that now my son is five months old and almost 20lbs and the tub leaks. It is not just a slow leak but a leak that lets all the water out by the time we are done with the bath. I am so disapointed with the tub and am going to throw it in the trash!!I am going to keep the sling, it is the only valuable part to the whole thing."
170682,2,"While the frame is very attractive, the display on Amazon.com online made it appear to be a 5 x 7 frame. There were no dimensions furnished, which I consider deceptive advertising by omission. I was very disappointed, when it arrived, to see that it wa only made large enough to hold a wallet photo."
105718,1,"My sister got this for us for the new baby due in April but our 2 year old is still in diapers so I figured, why not use it now? I wish I had this thing for the last 2 years! It's great and it's so easy to put together and use. It's so much better then the Diaper genie (which I have never owned but have used at other people's houses.) I love that it uses a regular trash bag and it saves so much money that way..unlike the Genie that you have to buy the dumb cartridges for. I highly recommend this product! I know 4 other people who are pregnant right now and I am going to tell them all about it!"
23261,1,"I find this is be a handy way of storing breast milk. It fits the bags nicely and compresses them so they are not difficult to store they are neatly uniform so you can stack in alot of bags. The draw back is the cover does not lock on the base, it rests on it and if you own a side by side fridge/freezer it can be difficult to find shelf that can fit it."
50190,0,This is good for carrying the maclaren quest sport stroller anywhere except for airport check-in baggage. It is better to use the original cardboard box if you want your stroller to be totally safe from baggage handlers.
174586,1,"We got this for our 2 1/2 year old and he loves it ! I was nervous about him staying in his own bed now, but he was so excited about Snoopy that he was eager to get in it and so far has stayed put."
11424,2,"We purchased this item for our newborn. It was great while it lasted, but it only lasted a little over 1 month. I rarely write bad reviews, but I thought this product warranted it because of how short these monitors lasted! I'll start with the pros.PROS:1. These monitors have exceptional range. I have the base unit on the third floor and was able to get reception in the cellar as well as across the street in our garage. A++ for range.2. The number of channels to choose from limited the amount of interference static. However no matter what channel we were on our cell phones managed to give annoying static and we were alerted by our baby monitor any time of text message was being sent or when one was coming in.3. There's two of them so you can switch out. The fact that there were two made this product last longer because when the first one no longer had reception we switched to the other on.4. The base unit and the monitors plug in. HOWEVER as another viewer mentioned, plugging your monitor in for more than 12 hours will fry the monitor. So if you forget to unplug your receiver, you've ruined the monitor.CONS:1. It was hard to avoid ""bursts"" when the unit was around our cell phones and by around I mean in the adjacent room.2. The pro of having the monitors have an A/C adapter become a con when you can't just leave the units plugged in. And not only can't you leave them plugged in, you destroy the product if you do. Why have an A/C adapter in the first place?!3. The monitors stopped getting reception after only one month of use! And if I'm being accurate each monitor only lasted a few weeks. We just moved on to the second one after the first one died. So while as a whole we were able to use the unit for a little over a month if both monitors had been in use at the same time we wouldn't have had that much time.In my book no matter how great the pros were/are, if the product only works for 1-2 months then the product is worthless. I love fisher-price but these monitors barely deserve one star."
44512,1,"I received the CozyMe as a baby shower gift.Our three year old likes to sleep with it.It was great and all until I realized I could not wash the pillow.So this product is great for a cover.Plus, the Ivory color covers the red Hawaiian flower design I was not too fond of.Maybe the company purposely does this so that we spend extra money for the washable covers."
69922,1,If you are looking fir cheap diapers these are the ones. They are in the same class as pampers and huggies
42411,1,"The wrap is very comfortable and I have no back pain at all when I use it and I have back problems! Once you get the hang of wrapping it, it's easy to do. I have only used it one way so far because my son is still a newborn but he loves to be in it and usually falls asleep. I use it when I go to the store or go out, it's so much better than carrying a giant car seat or stroller with the car seat on it. I was a little worried about buying it because it's basically a giant piece of stretchy cloth! But, I LOVE LOVE LOVE it and am so happy I decided to purchase it. I highly recommend it!"
48598,1,"I love this highchair. I originally bought (like many others) because I liked its look. Although some of the other reviewers said it was hard to clean, I actually find it quite easy to clean. True, food pieces get caught inbetween the wooden rails, but I just spray the chair with clorox ""anywhere"" spray to loosen the food and it comes right off. The tray comes off in two parts, both of which are easily cleaned with soap and water. The chair has a plastic piece that goes inbetween the baby's legs, which I find to be sufficient for keeping my wiggly son in place - no need to use straps. This is much more convenient than my mother-in-law's chair where the only thing securing my son is a couple of nylon straps. There is also a shelf underneath the chair that I use to store toys, which are conveniently tucked out of sight. I have bought several Eddie Bauer baby products and this one is by far the best."
181158,1,My son simply loves it and it helps to get some things done around the house( of course while watching what the little one is doing!) He loves all the toys that come with it! Very great gym!
60222,1,"I love, love, love this tub! ... This tub is excellent, my 3 month old stays in one spot and i dont have to have ahold of her the whole time. Plus she has so much room and the sides are high so she don't splash the water everywhere. This is the only tub to get!!!"
133584,0,"I thought I'd try these after my daughter started using the potty more often in an attempt to move away from diapers altogether. I found these to be ok but not any better than Easy Ups. As others have mentioned, my daughter never commented on feeling wet any more than with diapers or Easy Ups. If you just like the convenience of pulling something up instead of diapering, try Easy Ups first. They're cheaper (sometimes moreso than Cruisers) and just as good as these in my opinion."
68825,1,"Love them, I use them for both of my boys."
133492,1,"We've used Avent before and like these better. Nipple collapse rarely occurs because of the special vent. We tested it by taking the vent out and the nipple collapsed much more often. The glass is nice because you can microwave water in the bottle, plus, I don't trust plastic even without the BPA."
108517,1,this is so comfya nd my 1 1/2 year old loves it.. you cant clost the lid at all while seat is on toilet due to the little princess crown on the back.. Great product though
39581,1,This is a wonderful product! Having an infant in the winter is hard because you are not allowed to have bedding. This sack kept my infant toasty without having to put him in the bed with me.
182868,0,"This car seat is very comfortable for my daughter and was great when she was really small and couldn't support her head because it reclines way back and has a lot of padding. However, I nearly came to the point of throwing it away and buying a new seat at one point. For several months, I had a ton of trouble with the straps. They are extremely difficult to adjust at times. For some reason, the straps are not giving me trouble any more, but they can be frustrating if they get ""stuck."" For that reason, I would not recommend this car seat."
48263,2,What a scam! Yet another completely overpriced device for what it is and does. If you live in a building of any substance (brick walls for example) this monitor has a range of 20-30ft. It's completely useless. Unfortunately all these baby monitors suffer from this limitation. And there's really no reason. In the UK they sell two way walkie talkies with a room monitoring function. You can be at your neighbor's and still here your baby's breathing. And they cost $80.
172399,1,"When I started shopping for a bath seat for my daughter, I read reviews on all the seats and decided to go with this one. I was a little skeptical due to some bad reviews, but I am so glad that I bought this one. She loves it!! She was never very fond of taking a bath before, but since she has been able to sit in this seat, she loves her bath and doesn't want to get out. She doesn't slide around and fall out and it is great for me too. Getting her out can be a little tricky, but I have never scrathched or hurt her legs doing it. We love this seat and would definitely reccomend it. I wish that it wasn't quite so bulky and that you could store it easier, but it works great inspite of that."
12902,0,"If anything, this device is nice for what it plays back to the baby. It's been hard to hear the baby's heart beat, but I did hear it. What I've heard most is the baby kicking or punching me - I know that's what I hear because I feel it too! My favorite thing to do is hook up the speakers to my belly with music and then put the monitor up to my tummy and listen to what the baby is hearing inside! THAT is pretty cool! If anything, it's nice to play music to the baby - which it really seems to like - and read stories. The first time my husband felt the baby kick was when I had the music hooked up and the baby was kicking during certain parts of the song. It was really worth the money then! The stethescope part isn't all that great, but the speakers and the microphone are wonderful."
128883,0,"Finding the right Playtex nipples has been like a Goldilocks and the Three Bears experience for me. The latex Playtex slow flow NaturaLatch nipples that we got with our bottles were way too fast. My nearly 3 month old baby chokes because the milk flows so fast. When super hungry he can chug a 4 1/2 oz bottle in 5 minutes with the slow flow latex version. So I tried these silicone NaturaLatch slow flows and they are way too slow. My baby gets frustrated with how slow these nipples flow. It took him up to an hour sometimes to finish a 4 1/2 oz bottle! There needs to be some middle ground. Since these slow flow silicone nipples were too slow, I tried the medium flow version and it was way too fast.Strangely enough I found that the Playtex Orthodontic Latex medium flow is the perfect flow speed, but the flat shape of the nipple ""neck""/base makes it difficult to funnel the last of the milk into the nipple. The flat nipple makes it difficult for my baby to get those last drops even if I could funnel the last of the milk into it. Ultimately, there's always wasted milk with this nipple. Playtex needs to work on improving their nipple flows."
104207,1,"Very cute , my 3 yr old wore this in a wedding as a ring bearer, its pretty true to size in length but i thought the waist was rather big considering it was elastic in the back. My son is rather small and thind these droped right off , i fixed with pinning the waist . the rest fit as a 3t would ,I am not being negetive just a heads up for someone looking for a correct size.for the money this purchase was worth the $$$ considering it would have been more to rent."
152953,0,"These locks worked GREAT, until my daughter turned 1 year old. now, she pulls the cabinet door open as far as it will let her, then slams it back closed- as fast as she can- bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!without fail, she then tries to stick her fingers in to pry the door open while slamming the door shut (dont ask me- it's just what she does!) so now i'm searching for those magnet locks which keep the door completely closed. ugh. perhaps these are better for older kids? not so sure, but i know they are worthless to me now."
112532,1,"I allways used the pampers dipers for my baby. huggies just don't do the job for my little one. Pampers crusier allway keaps my douther happie and dry. and whit the economic plus pack, diper becomes more affodebole for us. insted of 80 diper for 40$, I get 160 dipers for about 37$."
176479,1,"This pump is great for the money. The only downside is that it's a little noisy. It does, however, get the job done."
146300,1,"My daughter just loves this jumper. She is now 9 1/2 months old and 31 inches long, and she can still use it. She loves to jump (and has loved to jump for the last few months), and the jumper helps her do it to her heart's content. She also still likes the toys after a few months of occasional use - sometimes when playing on the floor with me, she will crawl over to the jumper and try to stand to play with the toys on it (until I help her actually get in it, of course). I was wary of getting it since my daughter is on the tall side and I worried she wouldn't get much use out of it, but it has lasted a while. And, given how much she enjoys it, it was definitely worth it."
114717,1,"This seat is perfect for restaurants, trips to Grandma's etc. We even use it to feed our son when we are sitting on our deck. We use it much more than we thought we would. My son is only 8 months old so I know we will get many more uses as it transitions to a booster seat too. I also love how the tray has a cover to keep it sanitary. A great buy for the money!"
40623,1,"Pampers are not the cheapest diapers, but they have worked the best so far, and we have tried several other premium brands. The Cruisers seem to be the same quality as the Swaddlers, which we also used. They are softer than others, and fit much, much better. I highly recommend these diapers."
83579,1,"This is great. Totally secure, fairly easy to put on and off (although not quiet and you do have to put a bit of muscle into it). The best part is that it comes apart for travel. It takes about 10 minutes to take apart or put together and does require a screwdriver, but this is much better than any other bedrail that we saw. I would not pay $150 for it though. You can get it for $40 elsewhere."
146367,1,"I just received my Rainforest Jumperoo today, and just put my 4 1/2 month daughter into it for the first time... She has now been in her jumper for an hour!!!!! She loves it!!!! She's just been jumping, talking, laughing, and playing with all the toys. Ya know, she has a swing, a playmat, and a bouncy chair, and she can barely stand being in them for maybe 10 minutes... She's been in this thing for an hour!!!!!! Kind of makes me wish i had bought it a month ago, lol... This is hands-down the best thing i could have ever bought for my daughter, and i will definitely be saving it for any future children i have. It is easy to assemble too, only took maybe 5 minutes. The only thing is the little butterfly doesn't stand up like the picture shows, but i'm guessing they probably just had it like that so you could see it in the photo. I checked pictures of other kids and theirs was floppy too, all the better to teethe on!!! I'll definitely recommend this product for all of my friends with babies!!!!"
145026,0,"I was expecting the bag to be a little wider but it fell short on that end. You can only fit a few small essentials. I tried to roll a baby blanket but it was too thick to go into the bag. You will have to take out some of the items in order to get to the other ones at the bottom. I was better off using the free diaper bags they give at the hospital from the baby formula companies. They can fit more things than this bag did. The two top zippered compartments were too shallow for things other than your keys, lipstick, and a small wallet. The bag itself does not have zippered closure so the stuff in it is exposed. Not an ideal diaper bag for a whole day trip out and about."
102035,1,"I read many reviews before purchasing this bottle warmer. Many others are reported to heat unevenly, too hot, or too cold. We've had no problems with this one! Of course I do swirl the milk around after it's heated just in case, but I works wonderfully! If you need a bottle warmer, get this one!"
145190,1,"This was very easy to assemble and had plenty of toys to keep my 5 month olds attention, but not too much to be overbearing. It was a little high for him even on the lowest setting so I had to put a pillow under his feet but it wont be long before he'll grow into it. Overall I found the quality to be great and very stable (I was a little worried) and would definatly recommend this jumperoo to other parents."
43079,1,How lucky could one be??? Best car seat around to keep my little one safe and the Gators to go along with it! this seat is hard to find but SO worth it!
34036,0,We used it once for a domestic flight and it already has tears at the bottom. Not at all durable. Disappointing after having spent all this money.
19079,1,"I bought this for my infant but it did not work out well for us (got the Moby instead) but once she was 6 months it has been an easy way to have a free hand while doing laundry or walking to the mailbox, without having to ""get all strapped in."" I think this is a must have for an older baby for quick uses--where you just need 1 hand. The pattern is fantastic by the way. Very nice."
112259,1,"After trying many brands, Pampers was the only that didn't leak through the night. My son is now 2 1/2 & he still drinks plenty of milk so I use them faithfully. Others Mom's I talked to agreed that Pampers seemed not to leak; for the boys especially. I used the regular Pampers for the 1st year then tried the Cruisers line as they have more give around the waist when my son started moving around a bit more. I hate that they're pricier than all other diapers but saves time & money in washing wet clothes for other diapers that leaked on me incl. Huggies, CVS brands, etc. I just wish Amazon excepted the Mftrs. coupons for Pampers but they do offer free shipping & only reason I order them here is w/the price of gas, a trip to the store is now $4 anyway!!!!"
74168,1,"I got this when after having my 2nd a year and a half ago. My son was about 3 at the time. It is a great stroller and pushes very smoothly and is very compact compared to other double strollers.Cons: 1. wish it had a place to hold a drink for me. There's mesh pockets on the back of the front seat that work well to hold drinks or snacks for the kids. 2. It is hard to steer one handed when both kids are in the stroller. (I find myself steering one handed if I am holding a drink) 3. It is quite heavy. The frame is steel so it's going to be heavy, but I didn't realize how heavy it was. I lived on the 3rd floor and so didn't get much use out of this unless someone was with me to help carry the baby or the stroller for me. I wish I could have used it more on my own. Now that I'm living on the ground floor it shouldn't be a problem.Pros: 1. My now 4-year-old can still sit or stand on it as he likes 2. the basket on underneath is very roomy 3. The buckles are easy to use 4. it fits in the back of our small car trunk (Nissan Sentra) 5. It's very sturdy and nothing has broken or fallen off since getting it and it's been through it's share of abuse.Overall, I am still happy with this stroller. After seeing other double strollers on the market, I think it's unavoidable that they will be cumbersome in some way. There are drink holder attachments that I could get also."
43105,1,"We live in SF, and a salesperson at Babies-R-Us steered us toward this and away from the full traveler system. We owe her b/c it was clearly the right decision - it's light, breaks down easily, and compact."
7142,1,"I usally buy Luv's diapers and have for all my children, I learned with the first that cheap diapers are just that. But with every child I have learned each diaper fits each kid differently- well, with my youngest the Luvs diaper would fold at her waste and eventually allow the diaper to open leaving only the band attached, Huggies did not have enough Velcro- so I tried Pampers cruisers, they are soft,flexible and hold very securely, ans of course the Sesame Street is just a bonus (LOL). I don't like the price,but through Amazon I am able to buy from home,get the best price I have foudn them to be, and I don't have to use any gas cause they are delivered right to my door- so I save all around. Really- try all the diapers and find and use what works for you, but if you experience the same probs I had...these are the ones."
16108,1,We purchased this when my first child was about 5 months old and are still using it (he is now 3 and has a little sister). We initially bought it for indoor use - my son spit up all the time and we got tired of washing blankets! This was perfect for keeping the floor clean and it was so easy to clean off! It is also incredibly portable - it folds up so easily and the detachable carrying strap is great. We have used it for countless playdates - both indoors and out - and this mat is still in excellent condition over 3 years later. It has become our staple baby gift for our friends having babies. We are sure to let them know that it is much more than a picnic blanket (although it is great for that too). We cannot say enough good things about this product!
124317,2,I'm very unhappy with this product. My 13 month old was able to pull the little plastic bolts on the hinge off easily. They present a terrible choking hazard. I can't believe this product is still on the market and not part of a recall. NOT SAFE!
151371,0,"I bought this mirror because it does not distort the image of my baby, but since it does not the baby appears to be very small in the image projected. This mirror is easy to position, which is great if you have a low traffic back seat, but if things are shuffled around in your back seat the mirror will move and frustrate you to no end!"
77081,1,"We just got this swing for our 3 1/2 month old daughter about 3 weeks ago. Can I tell you she LOVES it!!! She just lays back and watches the lights and the butterflies pass by. I LOVE the fact that it plugs in! I was getting it out of the box and thought OH NO, I don't have batteries. Then while ""I"" was putting it together I saw that it plugged in....WOOOHOOOO! As you can see, I put it together myself...it was that easy! I was SOOOOO Excited when I saw it here on Amazon for $114 SHIPPED! I had waited a while to get one because I REALLY wanted this one, I just couldn't pay $159 for it so I JUMPED on it when I found it at this price. BUT it would be worth the extra $$...we LOVE it that much!Rachel"
87349,1,"i have tried alot of diffrent bottles. At first i had the vent air bottles, i made the mistake of buying a whole bunch without my daughter trying them, she didnt take the nipple so then i went with the avent bottles, she took the nipple but she was so gassy it was horrible,i even bought the gas drops but it still didnt elimate her gas, i mean she is REALLY gassy, i wasnt to thrilled on doing disposable bottles, but i keep on seeing the commercials about how they are so great if your baby has gas, so i sucked it up and got one....WOW SHE ISNT GASSY. its just more time consuming to put the bottle into a crock pot to get it warm,but its what i have to do. now all i have to do is figure out what to do with all the other bottles that she didnt like!!!"
102365,2,"This mobile is way too heavy and big for myBabyletto Modo 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Two Tone, which is by no means a flimsy crib. The whole thing feels top-heavy and leans towards the inside of the crib when installed. The clearance between the bottom of the mobile base and my 6.5"" mattress is also less than the 7"" minimum required according to product instructions. On top of that, the music is way too soft even on the highest setting. Therefore, the mobile is going back."
122683,1,Nice set and beautifully made. We love it. YEs it is 100% cotton and we do think it is worth the money and saved over somthing similar over baby r us by at least 50.00 dollars or more.
69691,1,"We needed a changing pad that was shorter than the typical 32"", in order to fit a table with a hutch. This product is holding up well after a month of use and the surface hasn't picked up any stains yet from messes that soaked the covers."
104256,0,"Does sort of what I want to do, but product is just some clear plastic with a hole punch which is difficult to use, some tie wraps and a few screws. We'll see how long it lasts. Plastic is starting to tear. Needs more holes punched and more tie wraps for proper support. Ended up using a screwdriver to punch the holes (guess an awl would have been better had I had one) since it was easier and I can put them further in to the plastic for proper support."
23333,1,"My son's lunchbox is from this company and I've been so pleased with how it's worn (still looks like new) that I decided to buy a splat mat as well. It was a little more than I wanted to spend, but worth it. It's cute and colorful, but very durable. We've used it for fingerpainting as well as under the highchair. It folds up to a small size and washes easily. I think we'll use this product for many years!"
8256,2,"Purchased this item for a Serta contour changing pad and it wasn't until it was on the changing pad that I realized it didn't fit correctly because it wasn't made for a contoured changing pad. I guess I didn't fully read the description so the ill fit wasn't that big of a deal. However, the material seems kind of cheap and the terry tends to pick if you catch velcro - from a diaper tab or swaddle blanket - on it. Overall I like the Carter's and Babies R Us brand changing pad covers much better - the better quality is worth the few extra dollars. I would not purchase this item again, even if it did fit the Serta changing pad."
34816,1,We bought this product just two weeks ago. It was relatively easy to install. We did have to use a rolled up towel to level it properly on the passenger seat (it was at an uncomfortable angle for my baby before we placed a towel underneath the car seat). I believe it's money well spent. Highly recommend this product to any other parent.
175165,2,"I bought this for my daughter at 4 months. She is pretty good on her tummy and enjoys almost any toy. She was sooo frustrated with this. She didn't understand why, even when her aim was perfect, she couldn't ""catch"" the toys inside."
104983,1,Excellent product that I would highly recommend if you have skin sensitivities or if you have dry skin. I really like this product!
46132,1,Keeps my son busy for a long time. He loves looking at the different shapes & patterns then giggles. My son started enjoying it at 2 months. The only negative thing is wish the mobile spins. Had to use the attachment on my other mobile that has that option.
180609,1,"I got this single Instep jogger a little while back, put it together and started using it right away. My little one is now big enough for a jogging stroller, but now that I saw how secure she is in this, I probably could have started using it earlier. Its super nice, large sunshade, small pocket for storing wallet, keys, water bottle, reclines and has a secure harness. There is also a hand brake, sturdy foot brakes and a wrist strap should the stroller ever (gulp) get away from you! Hope that never happens! Also, the fact that the single version folds smaller than my Graco Metrolite is very impressive. I would recommend this to anyone who is a moderate/average jogger."
55840,2,"I disliked the fact that a little too much or too little water required another try. Yes, it warms up the bottle very quickly but it can over do it fairly easily. We found it easier to warm the bottles just by placing them in a cup of hot water. I'd skip this item."
63237,1,"Some of the questions for this review do not apply, such as, ""How much fun is this toy?"" so don't let my rating fool you. We are very happy with this toy box. It has a safety lid, and it is nice a big. It's beautiful and seems like it will last for a very long time. We are extremely happy. I just have a hard time giving a top score for ""this toy's educational value."" Ha ha..."
127238,0,"For what it is, a lightweight, throw in the trunk spare stroller, it's just fine. If you're looking for more out of it, you're going to be disappointed.1.The canopy is a waste. I took it off and threw it away, and living in Los Angeles, I could use a sun protector, but this was such a pain, it wasn't worth it.2.I'm 5'7"" and I kick the wheels constantly, which is a complete pain in the neck.3. There is no basket. In it's defense, most umbrella strollers don't have baskets, but it's still something to consider.4. The bar on the bottom that you need to pull out to collapse it is very tough to do. I wish I had tested it first. They MUST be easier ones out there.5. On the plus side, it's compact, lightweight and does it's job decently."
169872,0,"We got the DaVinci Emily Dresser/Changer and Crib. They were easy to put together and I love the way they look, but they are not well made! My 9 month old neice was over last weekend and while changing her, the whole dresser would shake side to side because of her wiggling. Also, I opened a drawer to put some clothes away, and the front fell off causing the side of the drawer to crack.We were able to put it back together, and put some wooden braces across the back which have made it a lot sturdier, but this was a lot more work than we expected."
148805,0,"Once I received this pillow I slept on it for three nights straight and then have been using my regular pillows ever since. There are some pros to the pillow. It really is comfortable to lay on and does support your entire body well. It really is great on your neck as your entire body is at the same level as your head, minimizing any neck discomfort. It also does minimize hip, butt, and back pain. When I used the pillow I didn't toss and turn as often.There are also some cons with this pillow. It could be a bit longer. If you are tall and want to use it between your legs you will only be able to use it to keep your knees from rubbing together. Forget the lower half of your legs. It is also really big. I have a queen bed and my husband cannot sleep in bed with me. Everytime I move, the pillow seems to spread out further. My biggest complaint that caused me not to sleep with the pillow anymore is that there really is nowhere comfortable to place your arms. Whatever side I layed on, that arm would fall asleep or throb in pain. You can place your arm under the pillow and stretch it out on the bed, but you can only deal with the pain for so long. Also, like the picture shows above, you can put it around your waist in a sitting position and read or breastfeed. This is very uncomfortable and I can't get the ends to stay up to support my head. Also, I think it was meant for very thin women, because it doesn't fit well around my waist and I am only a little bit overweight.To summarize, if you don't mind sleeping alone and you don't mind not having lower leg support or some arm pain, then this is the pillow for you."
96849,1,"I LOVE this sheep! It's very soft and fuzzy, and you can pick four different soothing sounds. The whales were a little disturbing and not my daughter's favorite, but the other three are great. I love that you can attach this to a crib, or when your baby gets older they can simply snuggle it. The batteries seemed to last for a while, and you can set the volume and the length of play. Loved it!"
84399,1,"I bought this swing for my 6 month old grandson. It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Excellent for babies and young toddlers. I am glad I purchased it. The only thing I would like is a little padding for the back of the head, but I guess it would raise the price too.Excellent quality all over."
116907,0,"Loved this tub the first three months of my daughter's life. She was well positioned and really enjoyed bathing in this tub. Now that she is almost 4 months though she is too big for the ""newborn"" side of the tub and hates the infant/toddler side. It sits her up too tall and she flops over to one side. Also hard to wash her on when she sits on the infant/toddler side because the water is too shallow. Loved it at first but won't last you very long!"
20117,1,We love these bottles and recommend them to all of our friends with babies.
105943,0,"We are cloth diaper users and were attracked to the diaper champ because it said it could be used for cloth diapers and it keeps the smell in unlike other diaper pails. We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes. Some of our diaper covers also got stuck in the mechanism and I had to take it apart with a screwdriver to avoid ripping the cover. Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail. If you are planning to use cloth, this is not the pail for you.If your are using disposables, I think this pail would be great since you can wad them up into a tight ball. It doesn't stink except when you open it to change the liner and it takes regular bags."
94766,1,"You need the warmer for reusable wipes. I have the Prince lionheart : )All the hype about bamboo sold me ... I bought the bamboo, even after reading the bad reviews ... shame on me! They did fall apart! I did not dry them, washed them on gentle, took care of them, but sadly, even after the first wash they started to fray and just fall apart. I ordered these at the same time, and, as stated in the reviews, these are great! They have held up perfectly!They not only held up, but also, you can put far more of these into the wipe warmer! That is important, because you will go through them lolI never dry them! I take them from the wash, fold them, put about 2-3 tablespoons of witch hazel in a gladware bowl with warm water then I drop them in folded, get them wet (not too wet) then transfer them to the warmer. I pour the remaining water/witch hazel into the bottom of the warmer to keep the pad wet (pad for the lionheart warmer) and done!Love these!"
140943,1,"As a new mom, breastfeeding and pumping can be difficult. I have been using the Embrace since the beginning with good success. I find that the suction well mimics my baby's natural suckling which makes pumping easier for me. The pump could be quieter, but I don't find the noise to be that obtrusive. The tote is reasonably inconspicuous, making it easier to bring to work. I do think more storage rings should be included, thus 4 stars. Additionally, our baby is going back and forth between the Slow Silicon Natural Latch playtex nipples and the breast with very few problems, making th drop-in system very easy for us."
157215,0,"I have had a Pump In Style Advanced for approximately 6 months. I've used it daily since returning to work and have generally been happy with it. Recently, the face plate of the pump broke such that I cannot use the pump. I called Medela customer service and was told that they only have a 90 day warranty. Eventually the rep agreed to provide a replacement faceplate but told me I would have to pay for expedited shipping. After I asked to talk to a supervisor, the rep eventually offered to provide expedited shipping without charge. Even with expedited shipping, I was unable to pump for a day. If I had it to do again, I would rent a hospital pump - they provide loaners and replacements same day. Medela makes you jump through hoops to get the pump fixed even when the pump breaks through no fault of your own."
103514,1,"Out of the 2 seat/stools we've tried, we definitely like this one better. At first, we used it as a seat while bathing my young son. Much easier than kneeling or sitting on the edge of the tub. Now that my son is climbing onto everything, we place this against the couch or bed so he can climb up himself instead of needing us to pick him up onto the couch/bed."
109414,0,"I really like the concept, however, I think the release of this item was premature. The mesh pocket should be seamless for easier washing. Also, it isn't travel friendly; it needs a snap-on cover to make it more portable."
155161,1,"I order the item on Friday, Feb. 18 and received the order on Saturday, Feb. 19 - AMAZING SERVICE!!!!!! - I cannot believe it. Everything was in order and just as I ordered it. I am impressed with this vendor."
64771,1,"I've used the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing with both my children and they absolutely loved it! The design of the seat is very comfy and will fit smaller as well as larger size infants (and toddlers). My two year old still tries to climb in it for a swing (and has actually fallen asleep in it). Yes, there is a weight limit, but try explaining that to him. My 9 month old LOVES it and swings everyday! Very entertaining and very portable -lightweight yet sturdy)!"
153515,1,"My kids love having these in the bath. The tablets dissolve quickly and the water starts turning colored instantly. The container is huge because the tablets are not that large, but there were 24 in the container I got."
92021,2,It is important to clamp the seat belt when using a child's car seat but this clip is hard to use and a pain to get on and off. A better system is the red clamp that comes with other car seats.The Graco seat is a design nightmare and should be avoided at all costs.Always test the seat installation before buying.
95886,1,"I originally bought an exersaucer to have something to put my 4 month old in while I was doing housework, etc. She grew out of being interested in it at about 7 months so I had to get something else to keep her entertained while picking up around the house. After reading the reviews I thought this would be the perfect solution. It seemed like it would be entertaining and would give her something to do so I could get a few things done. WRONG! She was entertained by this the first few days and now she won't get in it and play at all. I think this product would have been more entertaining if I would have gotten it earlier, perhaps at around 4 months. This product is made well and looks like it would captivate the interest of a younger baby. I say thumbs up as long as your baby isn't too old."
175920,1,This is a great sling so far. Especially great for holding a newborn nice and close. My son is just 3 months and loves it when I carry him around in the tummy hold. The loop that holds the two pieces of fabric can be a little difficult to reach...it is supposed to be in the middle of your back when positioned right but seems to be a little higher on me. Other than that is seems to be a great sling. I am hoping it works as well for the hip carry.
159871,0,"I just bought this gate today for using at the bottom of my stairs. I bought this particular gate because it says that it works well on uneven walls. The only problem with that is that only one of your two walls can be uneven. I have baseboards running along both sides of the stairway, and the only way the gate will work is if we lift it like 3 inches above the floor to clear the baseboards. There is only a ""perfect fit"" adjuster on one side of this gate. My husband and I are going to try pressure mounting it tomorrow so we don't have step over it or remove it everytime we need to walk up or down the stairs. I'm hoping that will solve my problems. If it does then I will have to change my rating to 4 1/2 or 5 stars."
12325,0,too small - food travels further than 3'x4' - easy clean up but a pain to straighten out on carpet - bunches up - if i knew this was a shower curtain i would've gone to the dollar store and save myself 7 bucks
117569,1,"Our 4-month old is having SO much fun in this jumper. She sometimes jumps with her arms down in the leg holes, but still seems to have a blast. She has smashed her fingers a few times, but she's having so much fun she doesn't even pay attention to any pain it might have caused. I definitely like the tray b/c she will play with Sophie the teething toy (another must-have in my opinion!). She will usually play in the jumper from 10-30 minutes...long enough to let me get some dishes or laundry done!"
29330,1,"So, this is actually the second one we've had. The first one I received as a gift for my baby shower, for my now 4 year old. Her 1 year old younger sister got a hold of it and through it on the ground. Yes, it will break if you throw it on the ground. So, as a I frantically ran to the internet to find an identical replacement, I turned to Amazon. I was so happy to find the exact same piggy bank. My 4 year old was so happy to have it back. Very cute decoration for her room, and of course, she loves to put her money in it."
104386,2,"If you're looking to use this gate with the extensions, good luck! I have a 65"" opening that needs a gate and I went to the manufacturers website plus amazon to make sure I had the correct measurements and extensions I needed. When the gate arrived, it was way off....the gate without the extensions is much shorter than what I had expected it to be from measurements listed online.On top of that, the gate we received was defective. The gate metal was warped and the door would not latch at all, unless we had the hulk handy to completely bend the gate!We returned this gate and have since gotten the Summer Infant Sure and Secure extension gate. It involves hardware to install which is the only downside but the measurements were correct and the gate actually works!I will say, Amazon took the gate back with no issues and UPS picked the gate up from our house the day after we requested a return, so kudos to them for their customer service!"
51826,1,"I purchased this stroller for my 18mos old daughter. We live in an older urban neighbor with uneven sidewalks and lots of curbs. Our regular stroller was taking a beating, so we purchased this for neighborhood walks. My daughter prefers this stroller to her regular one and so do I. I honestly have no compaints. It is heavy, but because we don't transport it, it's not an issue. I would not recommend this stroller for shopping-too big and heavy. Perfect for serious walkers!!!"
67295,2,"I bought this gate for four reasons: it looked sturdy, it looked portable, easy to use, plus the price was right ($20 at Target). Well, it is portable, and was reasonably priced...but that's it. Since I can't find the receipt...it's now in my basement waiting to be donated. My husband doesn't mind it as much as I do, but it's just awkward, hard to use, not sturdy and even has some sharp plastic edges kids could cut their hands on. Also, my kids have already knocked it down (my husband said I didn't have it put in properly), but if I didn't, it's just too much of a pain to have to deal with when used as a pressure gate. The good old fashioned wood gate is better in that regard. That's what I'm using now. One other note, it's acutally not very tall so if your kid is taller than about 34"" they might be able to climb over it."
9212,0,"My daughter is still only 18 months old, so perhaps I should wait a few more months before writing this review. However, I wish I'd bought a potty seat (BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Black) instead of a standalone potty for the following reasons:1. My daughter is terrified of this seat. I'm not sure why, but it is the only thing I've ever tried to sit her on that makes her cry and which she refuses to sit on. She hates it, and I'm not sure why.2. She definitely knows what it is. She comes into the bathroom to me and points at it and says, ""Potty."" every time we go in the bathroom. However, she stays clear of it. I think the hollow seat and restrictive sides may be traumatizing to her. She is much more interested in my potty.3. Now that I know all of this, I also see the benefits of a potty seat from a clean up perspective. If she'd prefer to use the adult potty, I won't have to clean up poops by hand like I would with this one.All in all, I thought this would be preferable to her than a potty seat, and I was totally wrong. I think I'll re-sell my unused potty, and buy a potty seat which will be easier for me in the first place!"
35103,1,"We used this car seat for about a year.The color hides dirt and stains and overall was a good seat. However, the straps twist all the time and as if you don't have enough to do taking care of an infant you will also need to untangle them on an almost daily basis. We were never in an accident with this car seat and I believe that is the true test for a car seat.Consumer reports may be able to help with that info. This seat is heavy and my son was also heavy it was very hard for me to lug around. We purchased the Britax roundabout now that he has out grown the edie bauer and we LOVE IT! He is our second child and we have purchased five car seats the Britax is the best it is worth the outragous price."
50836,1,"In our prenatal class, everyone was raving about this pillow. I wasn't convinced at first because at that time, I wasn't having any trouble sleeping. That all changed a couple months ago. I got this pillow for Christmas and it's seriously been a game changer. Super comfy and has really helped me knock out some extra sleep hours. I am not waking up from tossing and turning anymore, now regulated to just the numerous bathroom breaks that are typical with pregnancy.My favorite part is that I get up earlier than my husband and in the last few weeks, what do I find? He's scooted over to my side of the bed and is snoogling away!Highly recommend getting this pillow. Also recommend getting a cover. I got this one.Snoogle Chic Jersey Cover in Gray"
147680,1,"My baby is a kicker. No blanket stays on her for long. We have tried a number of sleep gowns and sleep sacks. So far this is our favorite. The baby likes the silky feel on her feet and the ventilation helps prevent over heating. We like this sleeper so much, we bought a second one to send to day care with her instead of a blanket."
119434,1,I purchased this after a lot of research into different pillows before my daughter arrived. I can honestly say I don't know what I would have done without it! For the first few weeks it seemed to be permanently attached to me and it was great that I didn't have to put it on and off all the time. Baby was very comfortable on it and it was easy to adjust her position and once she was correct she would stay there. I had a section and did not have any issues with it sitting on my wound but I did put a pillow under it when she was very little as she needed to be a bit higher. As I type my 18 week old is half asleep feeding on it and she often falls asleep there and is easy to just pick up and put to bed.True it is tricky to put on with one hand but you soon get used to putting it on before picking the baby up. At least then you can get up and down as much as you want and not have to adjust it.I am sure that this cushion is one reason why I have never had any soreness from breastfeeding. Definitely my best buy. My baby and I love it!
101286,0,Product seems inferior in quality to the Baby Dry product we bought from a store. There is no wetness indicator either.Not very satisfied.
63655,1,"Let me start off by saying I am probably one of the world's biggest germaphobes when it comes to public places! My baby is 9 months old and has recently graduated to a convertible car seat, which I can't carry and snap onto shopping carts like I could with her infant carrier. So I purchased this for her because she chews on everything. Well it is FANTASTIC! It fits all carts I have tried it in (Walmart, Fred Meyer size carts) and it takes seconds to set up single handed. It's very colorful, baby likes it and I especially like that MY hands don't even have to touch the cart anymore! Would be nice if it had more padding but my baby flopped over in it and didn't cry, so whatever it does have works. Definitely worth the money when you consider how many people touch a shopping cart, after sneezing in their hands, picking their nose, handling money and bloody packages in the meat department. This cart cover makes it so I have one less thing to worry about, which is great. I also don't think it's too bulky as other reviewers have said - this can be rolled up and fits easily in my diaper bag or trunk."
120992,0,"I have just switched to using cloth diapers for my 9 month old, and started with about 20 Kushies brand diapers. Although I'm finding the diapers quite easy to use (especially with a disposable liner, which was the only way I could get my husband on board with the cloth diapering idea, and which makes dealing with a soiled diaper MUCH, much easier) I am surprised to find that the cover material is starting to fray and tear after just a few launderings. I've followed the manufacturer's instructions for washings, and am alternating between some line-drying and low-heat dryer drying. The material seems to tear easily near the stitching along the velcro tabs, and at the top of the waist. Also, my daughter has already figured out how to pull the velcro tabs open, so I think we'll soon be switching to the Blue Penguin SposoEasy brand, which have snaps and a sturdier material on the cover.In general, cloth diapering is a lot easier than I thought. If you are thinking about trying it, give it a go-- but do read more product reviews that I did before you invest in the diapers."
92724,1,"Although the picture is a little hard to see, this is a really gorgeous diaper stacker. It is delicate and sweet, and also very well made. Perfect for a new little baby's room. I would definitely buy this again and it would make a great gift."
134823,0,"The nylon cushion on the car seat, while easy to wipe off ""accidents"", causes my baby to overheat and become uncomfortable. Yesterday, she arrived at our destination (I have to admit, it was a two hour drive) with the entire back of her shirt soaked in sweat! I drove her home in just her diaper, and she was still crying from too much warmth. Even though they may be more difficult to clean, I would definately opt for a car seat with a cloth car seat cover."
173396,1,we co sleep and my 4 month old won't sleep anywhere unless I am next to her- anywhere but this swing...Once she falls asleep at night I put her in the swing and this allows me a little alone time or time with my husband. When I am ready for bed I pick her up and bring her with me!
41028,0,"We love Pamper Cruisers. As a mother of twins, we have had to try to find the best diapers. Pampers may be more expensive, but they don't leak. I would rather pay more for a diaper than have to keep buying cclothes becasue they are destroyed."
888,1,These diapers are ok for the money. They get the job done but I still miss the Swaddlers that we used to use. I wish they made them in a size 4 but they only go up to 3.
158517,0,it is too thin for the winter time. Could be fine for the summer.not worth the money to buy it.
46521,1,"I would give this product five stars if not for the fact that it is advertised as a bed rail that can be used without a box spring. In truth, it should probably just be said to work with platform beds, though I was able to line it up well enough with the slats on our frame (we had some extras) for it to work pretty well. But I wouldn't say it's going to be an automatic for every bed frame. Assembly was very simple -- I appreciated the fact that no tools were necessary, yet the rail itself seems to be quite sturdy.I do not need for it to fold down at this point, so I can't comment to its effectiveness there. We suddenly had to move our 18-month old daughter to a ""big-girl bed"" and this was what I ultimately decided to get to keep her from rolling off the mattress -- the railing comes up to a nice height even with our relatively thick twin mattress, so I am very pleased by that because it has the advantage of making it less likely for my daughter to hurt herself on the middle support bar that is unfortunately squared off and not round.Overall we have not had any issues for the first couple of weeks. I will update this review down the road if anything needs to be added or changed. We plan to eventually use this with a box spring under the mattress when my daughter is a little taller, so that may warrant an update of the review. :-)"
13277,1,"We originally bought the MightyTite to help us tighten the car seat as much as possible. In comparing our car seat to that of friends, we often noticed how loose their's seemed - even those installed by certified police or fire stations! However, last weekend we were broadsided and our SUV flipped, but because of my daughter's MightyTite (and a 5-pt. harness on her infant seat) my daughter's car seat NEVER BUDGED! Our car is completely totalled, and she didn't have a scratch on her. This is well worth the [money]!!!"
73604,1,"I bought the Itzbeen for myself prior to giving birth to my baby girl... it sat on the coffee table... I wondered how useful it could possibly be... my mother in law also wondered the same thing. After giving birth (my first baby) my exhausted sleep deprived brain could barely do anything but feed baby. The Itzbeen was my outside brain.. it told me when baby last ate, was changed, when I had my last tylenol (c-section), when I last slept (I used the timer for MY sleep schedule rather than babies). Now I am 3 months post partum... still sleep deprived... still using the Itzbeen. It has been without a doubt the best, most useful product (besides diapers) that I have for baby. My husband, all the grandparents, aunts uncles, etc all use it.. it makes it very easy to hand baby over to the next caretaker without having to try to remember to tell them when baby last ate, etc. You just look at the Itzbeen and all the information is right there. My husband and I joke that it has saved us from many sleep deprived arguements over who did what last for baby. I have since purchased 3 more for friends who have had their babies. Really, this product, though simple is a life saver... a sanity saver."
58521,1,At first I was skeptical about whether or not I needed this. At first I tried to sterlize my bottles in boiling water but realized that it was taking forever to do! After purchasing this sterilizer I was able to do all of the bottles in half the time! It's extremely easy to use and much faster!!! I highly recommend this for any new mom who doesn't have time to sit and wait for boiling water on a stove.
145661,1,I got this for my 4 month old (I know a little young) and she loves it! It is so adorable and is of great quality!
64490,1,"Great item, goes the job well that we needed it to do. Minor damage during shipping to a part we didn't intend to use anyway."
165599,0,"These diapers smell kinda plastic!!! But besides that the diapers function very, very well and has an incredible price. This is great since I just had triplets. Economy pack highly recommended for those with many kids!!!!!!!!!!!"
91239,2,"My husband and I placed this on our registry and ultimately received it as a gift. Although I like the dual monitors, belt clip and light features, I cannot stand the ANNOYING static!! I've tried everything to lessen the static and nothing seems to work. I've researched other monitors and will be returning this one in the hopes that I can find something with better clarity."
43528,1,"THIS SET IS TOOO CUTE!! It more than lives up to Laura Ashley standards. It is extremly well made, the bumper that you cant really see in the photo is adorable. The colors are much better in person and the fairies are 3-D. This is a quilt and it is very detailed. The fairies are embroidered on it. It's not a patterned material and it's not like sheet cotton fabric but way nicer, higher quality. If you even think that you like this set, buy it, you'll LOVE it. I would've paid twice as much."
103542,0,"Admittedly the tray does come off too easily and the sides are a little low for my taste. It is a very good chair, though. Being on our fifth child we have tried so many different routes and I have found that if the straps on most boosters aren't tight enough, it's your chair, not the booster. We've had the basic high chair and I still have the peg-perego (sitting in my garage) only a couple of years old. I will not go back to a high chair again. They take up so much space. I love the fact that the tray swings open, if only it didn't pop off whenever the child smacks it. Then everything on it goes flying. My 16, mo. old does love her seat, though."
128384,1,This gift diaper bag and all its contents were as described. Great sale price and a satisfied customer.I had ordered 3 gift baskets from the same vendor and all were great.
123212,1,"We ordered this when our son was 9 months old and becoming more mobile. We have a jumparoo, but we wanted to give him another option when we needed to ""contain"" him while we did stuff around the house. Initially we bought an indoor fence/play yard but it took up WAY too much space in our tiny old city house, so we returned it and bought this instead. We love it! And so does he! He can roll around and practice crawling and we can do laundry. It sets up exactly like a regular pack and play so it's very easy, but the nice thing about this one is that it's square so I think there's a little more room for him to maneuver. Plus, it's more colorful. He'll play with his toys and occasionally interact with the bugs on the sides. So far, I don't see a downside."
147987,1,"This is great for taking your baby with you all over the home because it's so light. It provides a safe spot to put your baby down. For example, great for the kitchen (floor or counter top) so your baby can watch you while doing chores. The no-skid feet work well and definitely keep it from sliding."
156229,0,"this swing has alot of sounds, but the nature ones dont even sound good at all. the front tray is very very hard to get up. my daughter has fallen asleep in it only a couple times. the pattern is cute."
127535,1,It is a great product. Very easy to install. I installed it myself in my second trimester. So you can imagine how easy it is. It looks great as well. Its very firm and sturday. You got to check for scratches. Because of the color the scratches are very visible but if you are careful then no problems at all. I have also converted it in a toddler bed once for my older son. It is back to a crib for my 9 month old currently but it very easy to convert.
138547,1,The twilight turtle shipped fast... and as described provides the constellations on the wall and ceiling in 3 colors. The stars show up very well and are a welcome addition to our nursery.
140610,0,"this sunblock is supposed to be the best for kids, but we found it too sticky to really use. the tube is a nice feature, making it very portable. i like the sunscreen wipes better though."
140231,1,"Its a little hard to adjust, but its definitely worth it. We've used it on our double jogging stroller as well as our double umbrella stroller. Folds away easily and doesn't take up a lot of space. I also love the pockets on the sides where I can store my keys, phone, water bottle, etc."
117454,1,"Life saver!! If you have to use formulas such as the kind for spit up, or soys.. You NEED this product. Simple shaking of the bottle like for normal formula leaves clumps that clog the bottle nipple, and creates a tiresome clearing the nipple ritual which makes your baby frustrated w/ the feeding. This is a cheap and very effective way to combat that issue.. NO MORE CLUMPS!!"
95431,1,I bought one for the playroom and it worked so well I bought another for my child's bedroom. Love it! I actually have quite a pile of stuffed animals in them and they hold up just fine.
84600,2,"I will never go out and buy such an important piece of equipment without first checking the ratings. It was great at first, but this pump obviously has a track record of breaking after a couple of months. One day I ended up stuck at work with no breast pump and absolutely no way to relieve my swollen breasts. My Medela works sooooo much better - I will never buy anything from Evenflo again!"
16833,0,The rails are nice but very diffuct to install and to put away under the bed. Hard to reach both sides to do so.
165678,2,"Baby dry was okay until my daughter's poop got bigger! It leaks! We even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday. I was very frustrated. Then I changed to Pampers Cruisers with Dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one. It worked perfectly!! No leaking and no washing of clothes any more!! But if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter, baby dry was okay. You just have to change often though."
16770,1,I really like this for my grandson- was pretty easy to put together- its good for kids who are prone to falling out of bed but too big to sleep in a crib- It seems safe to me also.
49943,1,"I received this stroller last week as a gift , and I have to say It is just as good as a Graco. I really do not see much of a difference (though there may be. I don't own a Graco, but I did &quot;test drive&quot; one in the store.). The only downfall to this product is the price, but seeing how I didn't buy, it really does not bother me. Anyway, just thought I would let everyone know!"
146301,1,My son will jump until he falls asleep standing up and I have to take him out. When you're trying to make supper it's the only baby item that I know will keep him happy until I'm done. What makes this particular one best is the frogs eyes will help support the baby's head so you can use it earlier than an exersaucer. I already had an exersaucer when I bought this jumperoo and my husband was not happy to have another large baby item cluttering up the house but even he changed his mind when he saw how much our son loves it.
55149,0,"I bought this stroller when my two sons got older as it was difficult to go to appointments alone with two kids running around. I was super excited when we brought it home, but was dissapointed in th weight of it. It is also very difficult to get my kids strapped in and the straps do not go tight enough to ensure they do not climb out. It is very difficult to push in my opinion although I am a smaller build so I don't know if that is to be expected. The seats after about a year are starting to *dip* inwards as they are made of a cardboard type material and my children are no more than 30 lbs. I struggle with getting the stroller to close and latch correctly as the wheels always turn and catch it. It is also a very large stroller and hard to fit into my trunk although it is a big trunk. All in all, I do like having a double stroller, but I wish I would have done more research for a smaller, lighter, and more funtionable stroller."
103103,0,"I bought this seat when my little monkey kept crawling out of the infant tub. Then, when it arrived, the package insert said ""do not use this product once child can pull up to standing."" I'm unclear when you would need to use this product then... If your child is not able to sit up, this product wouldn't be able to hold them up and you would have to use an infant tub. If your child is sitting but not pulling up, then bathing them is probably pretty easy. I have friends who use this if their child is pulling up/walking etc but not overly active and it works for them. If you have a very active child and have a hard time getting them to sit still, this is not a product that will help with that and is actually dangerous to use in that scenario. I have only tried to use this once, but I will keep it for possible future children who may be less like a little monkey :-)"
176911,1,"I love this warmer!!! I had no problems figuring out how to use it, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. I love the way it keeps the bottles cool AND warms them. I can keep the unit upstairs and not have to run downstairs each time my son needs a bottle. I like the nightlight feature so I can see what I'm doing without blinding myself. I also set it up with the babysitter and the water is premeasured for her to use. It's simple and easy."
171028,1,"I loved putting together this little book for my grandchildren. It holds mounted 4x6, that is you can use photo pages cut down. I could have cut down 5x7's. There are a lot of pages for a big family. The boys liked it. I would order it again. I agree it isn't the prettiest, but it is fun and durable and the shipping was very prompt."
76471,1,"This is my second baby. With my first, I searched for a wedge I could have him sleep with because of reflux and congestion. Never found one for his cradle, only crib. I was thrilled to find this that would fit in my new baby's cradle. After using it, I too found she would slide to the bottom of the cradle. To solve this, I took the positioners off (didn't need them anyhow) and placed the wedge UNDER the mattress of the cradle. Baby still sleeps on an incline for reflux, but the slope is more gentle and she doesn't slide anymore."
137600,1,LOVE THIS NIGHTLIGHT! My 3-year-old is completely enamoured with this night light -- as is everyone else who sees it! Couldn't be happier!
24265,0,"Fits mattress, includes velcro to hold in place. Too bad you can't fit cheaper and easier to fit sheets for arms reach can't find in local stores and these are pricey and only come in singles."
77917,2,"I used this bag flying from Orlando to Dallas via Atlanta. I did not check the car seat, I only used the bag to pull the car seat from the car to the airport and through the terminal. By the time I got to Atlanta it already had 4 holes. I read the earlier reviews which were mixed and thought I would try it. I had the same cover on my baby registry and needless to say I removed it from the registry as soon as I got back from my trip! It is a great idea, but the fabric is just not tough enough."
83200,2,"I love Dr. Sear's books, but this baby sling is much too large! I am a slightly small framed 5'5"" woman. My 6'5"" husband wears this sling just fine. But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly! I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old. I couldn't believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn't tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body! You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!"
58123,0,"I bought this walker online without actually seeing it first. I would not choose this one again.Pros:1. Very easy to assemble. We're talking idiot-proof.2. The activity center is a lot of fun for my 10-month-old. There are fun songs and lights that reward her for placing the balls and shapes in the right places.3. The walker is difficult to tip backwards when your child is pulling up on it. The bulk of the weight is in the front of the toy, so it provides a good counter-balance. However, this weight distribution leads to other problems (see Cons).Cons:1. Tips forward too easily. I don't know how the parents in the other reviews haven't had theirs tip over. My daughter is petite, so her size is not the cause. It tips over when something gets caught in front of it, and when my daughter gets a bit rambunctious and goes a little fast. She has fallen forward holding onto it numerous times. I won't let her use it without me right behind her.2. The brakes are useless. The walker still moves forward, with a little resistance--but only on carpet. If you have wooden floors or linoleum in the kitchen, this toy is too unsafe. On these types of flooring, it seems safer to have the brakes off.3. For what you get, this toy is over-priced. There are others out there that convert to ride-along toys for the same price of less.Overall, this toy is ""okay"" and my daughter enjoys it, but I would not recommend it as a first choice. I wish I had done more shopping around and gotten a sturdier walker with a better value."
34176,1,I used this to transport our snug ride seat and it protected it well. We had plenty of room and threw in a pack of diapers. Our neighbor borrowed it and it fit her Britax car seat. (sorry I am not sure of the type but it is big and fits kids up to 50 lbs.)So it lasted for two round trip plane rides so far.
171736,1,"I highly recommend this tub. I have used it placed within our bathtub--I sit low to the baby and do not strain my back. The sling was excellent to use when our son was a newborn--made bathing him a delight. He is now 6 mos. old and sitting up--the infant side helps him to sit up without falling forward (like babies first learning to sit up tend to do), since it provides an upward slant under his legs. As soon as he sits better, I'll move him to other side, which has the back support. At first, I thought as a little boy, sitting on the infant side was uncomfortable (looked that way to me!) but he loves bathtime so he must be ok. I do not fill the tub up too much so as to make him float--and he's just fine with that--he's too busy trying to use his hands and pick up his rubber ducky."
84032,2,"After trying these spoons for one week my wife couldn't figure out why our son wasn't enjoying his food anymore. She tried them herself and found out that there is some sort of chemical leaking out of the spoon plastic covering. It gives off a bad taste, possibly toxic. My wife made me taste it too, and writing this review (15 min later) I still can taste that awful plastic taste. These need more testing, or maybe just a lawsuit. At the very least I'm going to return these for a full refund."
93133,2,"I picked this up today and it is already on it's way back. Worse than the raised ""bar"" in the middle is the fact that the cross bars all the way around the darn thing are a serious finger pinching hazard. I cannot believe the pain I experienced when MY finger got caught....and it would have BROKEN a small child's fingers for sure. I shuddered when my one year old crawled up on the cot & reached over the edge. I do not even want this thing in my house...there is no way to guarantee it won't seriously hurt little ones....it got me!"
83921,1,"I bought this placemat to travel with us on our trip. I absolutely love it- it works wonderfully. My preemie son hasn't mastered his pincer grasp as of yet and kept getting frustrated as his food fell onto the floor. The tray immediately grabs it and feeding time for him is no longer agony for us. You need to press the suction cups extra firmly onto the table top. It stuck to all tables we used it on. If it didn't, we cleaned the table top AND the suction cups themselves- to the point where it was almost difficult taking them off! This placemat is also excellent for those moments where food just doesn't agree with our son and he immediately ""upchucks"". Disgusting, but at least it is ALL conveniently contained in the tray, you can quickly fold it up and rush to the bathroom to clean it up. Definitely need a dry towel to wipe it off after rinsing. Anyone who says it doesn't fit into their diaper bag needs to get a bigger bag! An enthusiastic two thumbs up!!! Way up!!"
10299,2,"After a couple hours of reading reviews I bought this seat. Many of the other product reviews said ""not for boys"". With this seat your boy would have to lean very far forward to not get pee everywhere. I also choose this because it adjusts on the bottom to fit long toilet seats, it fit the seat well. Another problem for me was the size of the hole. I have a big 2 year old and couldn't wipe him well. If you have a petite girl this will work for you!Amazon made it very easy to return this product at no cost to me:)"
40082,2,"I bought it for myself after reading other reviews saying that adults were also pleased with this product. Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. There is a static background for some sounds. Do not expect it to cover outside noises because it is the opposite. The highest volume setting is so quiet that the machine sounds are covered by all surrounding noises and it gets really bothering. I would return it if it wasn't so much hassle."
109446,0,"Best for: holding an ice cube to soothe a teething baby or as a baby-popsicle option for summer, watermelon chunks, frozen peas, etc, for when you want the baby happily occupied with tasting and soothing.Next best for: feeding a baby banana or avocado or mashed sweet potato when you want them to feed themselves so you can have your hands free, IF you don't mind the incredible mess the squished-through avocado or banana will make all over baby and high chair, and IF you can clean it out immediately after. The little fibers can get stuck in the mesh, so prompt cleaning is essential.Not a replacement for spoon-feeding, but will keep them happy in a high chair, without choke hazards, til you get dinner finished."
53772,2,"I was really happy to find this product as I was scheming to build one myself out of an old adjustable desk lamp. We have our first baby and we're really stressed out. The idea of being able to have something hold a bottle in her mouth, especially as we're changing diapers, seemed like a miracle.The problem, though, is that the clamp the secures the arm in place breaks very easily. We actually ordered two of these arms, one after the other, and the clamps both broke within minutes of use.With the first clamp, it broke when my wife was in a hurry to grab the baby. I didn't see what happened, we were both so sleep deprived, and my wife has a tendency to be sort of hard on appliances like vacuums, dishwashers, and so forth, that I assumed she pushed the arm too hard. After all, the thing got in the way of a mother and a crying baby.I got in touch with the manufacturer about a refund. They were a little hard to get in touch with, and we went back and forth with a lot of email. To give them credit, they did make a good effort to get in touch, but at this point I was working full time and getting almost no sleep, and I just didn't have the energy to deal with this, so I let it go. I decided to just order another one instead. Five minutes on Amazon was less hassle than God knows how much time and energy I just didn't have.The next one showed up and I took very special note of its care. The clamp broke in exactly the same place within minutes of fastening it to her crib. If you just move the arm after it's fastened, the clamp with break.So, I do not recommend this product at all. It's really a shame, cause all they would need to do is reinforce the clamp with metal, or just replace the clamp entirely with some sort of metal. I'm sure it would increase the price, but hell, I'd easily pay $100 for this thing if it actually worked.Hope this review helps."

59143,0,"This warmer does the job, but you should be careful not to forget and leave the milk in it longer than it has to(unfotunatelly there is not timer or allarm), because it gets HOT in no time. That happened a couple of times to me and I stopped useing it. It was much easier for me to put the bottle in a hot water from the sink. That was doing the same - without overheating the milk and spending $40."
128749,1,"I'm not the type to write reviews but this product warranted one. I also wanted to clear up some confusion. As another reviewer previously stated, please do not rate this product badly when you clearly are using it wrong. As with all Avent nipples, there is a fine, almost invisible line on the edge of the nipple. The proper way to position the nipple on the white screw ring is to make sure the fine line lands between the gap of the three screw lines under the white screw ring..got it? So if you're done cleaning the nipple and you're ready to put the nipple through the screw ring, make sure the line on the nipple lands in the gap of the screw lines under the screw ring.After you position the nipple, place the adapter bottle ring on the bottle and then tighten the screw ring on top. If you do this properly, there will be zero leaks. With this mouthful said, i do agree that Avent should make it easier to use their bottles without leaks. They should also tell you how to do this (i figured it out after doing a Google search because the packaging didn't say this).On to the variable flow nipple...My son has severe reflux and the doctors at the hospital where he went after a scary incident said to add rice to his cereal and to cut the tops of the nipples so the breast milk would flow easier. This worked for approximately two months until the holes became so wide because of the cleaning that my son started to choke on his milk. I found these nipples and they work great! The flow (when the III mark is towards his nose) is fast enough where my son doesn't get frustrated when sucking but not so fast that he chokes on the milk.My gripes? They're expensive."
3719,1,"This bag was exactly what I was looking for! It has just enough room so that it's not too big or too small. I love the smaller bag that's on the front, it's so nice that it comes off. This bag is actually pretty light weight as well and the strap that goes over your shoulder is fairly comfortable. It has some smaller pockets on the inside which are nice. All around a great buy!"
49744,1,"My 2 year old loves her Dora step stool. It's the perfect size for getting on the potty, or washing her hands."
69716,1,"The curtains were exactly what I thought they would be and look great in my baby girl's room. I matched them with the green valance and it's a nice contrast and works well together. I love them, and it matches the crib bumper and dust ruffle that someone had given me. Much cheaper than paying $300 for one of those crib in a bag sets that may or may not have contained window treatments."
47003,1,"Beautifully made nursing cover was key to my remaining discrete when nursing. It eliminated the need to dive into a bathroom or automobile for privacy. I'm not one to whip out my womanhood for all to see, so this product has been fabulous for me!"
49175,1,"The Superyard provides a safe space for my 9 month old toddler...he is into everything and learning to take his first steps. However, I was surprised at the difficulty I encountered when trying to adjust the size of the play area...the hinges are very difficult to bend and it is not easy to fold for storage for the same reason!!"
167449,1,"This just arrived. It is beautiful. The cover that was suggested to buy with it also came and is somewhat smaller than the comforter. Not a huge problem now, but will be as baby grows and I want the comforter to be as big as possible (for a baby comforter). So keep that in mind. I would look for a cover with the exact same measurements. I assumed - and we all know the problem with assume-ing."
133297,1,I received a born free bottle as a shower gift along with a few others (people advised us to try a bunch before deciding which one we would use). My son preferred the born free bottle from the beginning. We've now been using these bottles for 6 months and we're really happy with them. We put them through the sanitize cycle on the dishwasher every night and they are still like new. All the parts wash really well. We don't have any leaking problems. Every now and then we have a nipple that collapses but it hasn't been a big deal. It's very rare and I'm not sure what causes it. Overall we're really happy with these bottles. We're also happy we didn't get glass because I have one glass version and I quickly realized it's too hot when it comes out of the bottle warmer to actually grab it. These make more sense.
10544,1,"We only had 5 or so burp cloths, a thick flannel kind, and when I was looking for more to buy I found these by reading other people's reviews. At first I was hesitant because of how much thinner they are than the other kind I had, but now I use these almost exclusively.They are lightweight, but especially folded in half they work great as a burp cloth.My daughter's tear ducts did not open fully for several months, so she constantly had gunk coming out of her eyes. A corner of these thin cloths was a great way to gently wipe her eye area clean.She also uses these (at 8 months old) as her blankie, I keep trying to introduce others but she ""needs"" one of these cloths to snuggle to sleep. Works great for us since we have 2 dozen so there is always one at hand and clean! They are also lightweight so less of a smother hazard than a thicker blankie.I highly recommend these, they are versatile and even though they are thin they have held up well for us through many many washes.I DO NOT recommend them as cloth diapers - we haven't used them for this purpose, and they are so much thinner than other cloth diapers that I imagine you would have to use several."
177037,1,Got this 2 1/2 months back when my son was 9 months old. Its still holding up to his constant abuse - which happens everyday now. He likes to step up to it and rattle it like crazy :) but the gate doesn't seem to budge at all. Have 2 of these. This will continue to be useful as we're planning to get a dog soon. Highly recommended for kids and pets.
50402,1,"My wife bought this pillow when she was about 5 months pregnant. She loves it. But I think I love it more than she does. Before she had the pillow, my wife was all over the bed when she was sleeping. She would move all around in her sleep and usually had me hanging off the bed by the end of the night. With this pillow, that has stopped. She stays in one place, and she sleeps better. Because of that, I do too. It is also very comfortable. When my wife gets out of bed before I do, I often steal the pillow and sleep with it."
109177,1,"Good, just wish it went back further and weren't so hard to take on and off. Serves its purpose though"
26589,1,"Love this gate. Love the swing close feature, as I'm always forgetting to close the other (annoying) gate that I own (KidCo). This gate feels substantial, and it's easy to assemble and easy to use. Very happy with this purchase, and just returned to purchase another for the basement. Highly recommend!"
10574,1,"First, let me state, I have never actually used these as diapers. EVERYONE gets these for baby shower gifts, and they all look at me funny, until I explain why. These are the best ""spit rags"" ever created. Perfect for using as burp cloths, as they are large, and can be washed in hot water and bleached (though it's always best not to use bleach on baby stuff, these aren't actually put ON the baby). Products sold as ""burp cloths"" are generally very small....I think they were created by people who have never actually been spit up on. These flatfold diapers are very large....I fold them in half or tri-fold them long ways, and throw it over my shoulder. It's long enough to cover the front and back of my shirt. They are also good for a makeshift bib once the baby is old enough to eat baby foods. Simply tuck into the collar of the shirt. They make a good makeshift 'prop' for the head, if you roll it up (you know the ""U"" shaped cushions they make for helping baby keep their head straight). Of course you would never want to use them like that and leave baby unsupervised.If you need to lay the baby on a couch/chair to change a diaper, in a pinch, these can work as a changing mat too.Once the baby is older, and is done using them, they are fantastic cleaning cloths....great for glass, countertops, etc. They're good for keeping in the car to wipe up any spills, etc. There's a bunch of uses for these things!"
35892,0,"I bought this carrier thinking it would be a good safe way to carry my newborn around the house. I used it maybe a handful of times and now it just sits in his closet. It's wonderful, snug, and warm for a newborn baby but just isn't durable enough for a baby over 3 months. The fabric stretches out leaving you uneasy about taking both hands off of your baby. I find the Snugli Vent Carrier much more useful and dependable. I use it everyday and my baby just loves it! It holds baby somewhat away from your body keeping you cool unlike The Baby Wrap which just gets way too warm!"
41222,2,"Even on sale at Amazon, this is not one of the better prices I've found on these diapers. Even at regular price, they are $9-$10 at Wal-Mart and with a coupon, you can purchase them for $7-$9 depending on the coupon. The diapers are great, the prices are not."
30435,0,I was only really able to use this when my son was tiny. Like other reviewers stated the 'hump' in the middle is a definite design flaw! I had to sit my son's rear end in the smallest part of the tub when he got bigger... and now he's too big to lay down in it but not sitting up on his own yet. So the tub is useless to me now.Good points: I really like how colorful it is! Very durable! The mesh hammock is made well with a foam bumper and head rest!
109247,1,"I prefer the original Brest Friend covers, but I'm not crazy about the velcro strap. I love this nursing pillow overall, and it helps with positioning. I'm nursing a 3 month old and still use this pillow at home every day. I was ready to quit nursing because positioning my preemie was so difficult, but I saw this in the hospital ""nursing shop"" and made my husband buy it for me. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! It's far better than the Boppy pillow and doesn't roll the baby or move from my waist. There is nothing bad I have to say about the Brest Friend... skip the popular Boppy and get this! It rescued my nursing experience."
147331,2,"When this monitor arrived I was extremely happy with both the camera and the monitor. However I only used the monitor a few dozen times and the AC adapter (so we thought) failed. We purchased several adapters and still nothing. We now think that it has something to do with the connection inside the monitor. So basically we now have to use batteries. The batteries only last about one night, as you can tell we go through batteries like water....not good. I have emailed and called the company several times and I have not gotten a response. We paid well over what I would normally pay for a baby monitor. The total price including shipping was $177.95, I would expect the thing to work or at the very least I would expect the company to take responsibility and respond."
70880,2,"Junk junk junk. I don't know why so many good reviews. It looks so comfy on the picture, but it is just a piece of plywood covered with nylon, no cushion at all. All the ""fluffness"" you see in the picture is the nylon fabric folded around the metal frame, giving the illusion of cushion. My baby is a chubby 4 month old and slides to the sides because the back is straight with no pillows or any cushion on the sides. My toddler (2years old) likes to climb in the chair but I have to remove the toy bar all the time... pain the the b. Now I understand why there is another model where the toy bar just swings in and out, without having to be removed. I want to return it but the assembly was such a pain as well, that my husband will be furious to have to unscrew everything again!"
7991,1,"These pants seem comfy, have a nice fit and do hold the pee nicely. I haven't found a paper training pant yet that will make my kid want to run to the toilet - for that I use cotton; however, for travel this works and has the functionality of a panty. The sides are strong and won't easily rip like some other trainers I've purchased. That's a major plus."
165300,0,"This diaper normally does the job but occasionally will leak in the mornings.My 14 month old son's pajamas will be damp in the front. Also,an issue I have been having,are the tabs will sometimes break off. This is a waste of a whole diaper.I have wasted about 10-15 diapers in a pack due to this."
12996,0,"When I searched Amazon, I was looking for an extra tall gate. Unfortunately I presumed that what showed up in my search was what I was searching for, but when this gate arrived, it doesn't seem any taller than the average gate. I am disappointed because what I need is an extra tall gate not a regular sized gate. I will have to eat the $20 because Amazon will say it was my mistake and not their search feature's fault. It's too bad that when you search, things come up that are not at all what you're looking for. You'd think I'd learn....Very disappointed."
32312,2,"To me, these are terrible. They are small (only covering half of the surface under the baby), don't absorb much (as its like a piece of paper with a thin plastic coat on the back) and they are WAY to thin that my baby tears it all the time just from kicking and has done so since the age of 4 months. Personally I wont buy them again."
167638,2,"Don't be surprised, as we were, to find a completely different product when you open your formerly trusted brand and type of diapers; that what was an excellent product and a great value at 7 - 8 dollars (on amazon) has now shot up in price, all while the manufacturer has really cheaped out on the product. How? By reducing the _number_ of diapers in the package -- and by actually reducing the size!! The difference is so significantly smaller that we actually thought we had a size one diaper in hand. So, buyer beware. If you're looking for a great value, try CVS brand Ultra Soft-Stretch diapers. (No, I do not work for the CVS companies. Yes, I am really disappointed with a manufacturer like Pampers changing their price to product ratio so negatively.)"
166943,1,i bought this for a gift for someone who was surprised by the sex of their baby. room looks amazing for boy or girl.
50971,1,After heavy contemplation on this product I went to my local babies r us to see it in person. After seeing it there for 15 dollars more and feeling it through the package I decided to order it here. I am completely satisfied with the pillow.It has medium firmness and is plenty long enough for my 5'6 height. I like it positioned in the front or the back as it supports the belly and the back depending on placement. I would recommend getting a cover when you order (it has a thin white one on)it. I am headed to buy a cover for it now.
80846,1,My 2 yrs daughter likes Dora prints on this so much she chooses to wear this pull ups rather than the elmo pampers cruiser or underpants (she is now on potty training).Absorptivity wise easy ups is not as good as the cruiser.
91211,1,Baby monitors use a range that gets a lot of interference and therefore you can get a lot of static. I've used this system at four different places as we have been visiting my family. At every place it worked well but at every place it took a fair amount of adjusting to get a clear signal. This was especially true at my brother's who lives in an apartment complex; all those wireless phones and TVs really can cause problems. But with a little experimentation we got it working. It's a great product for the price.
139436,1,"This is a highly innovative toy that will certainly last your child for years.While this particular toy I bought for myself as a turtle enthusiast, I purchased theCloud b Twilight Lady Bugfor my soon to be born niece. As an infant to toddler she will be able to use it as both a nightlight and a plaything. As she ages, she will be able to learn about star constellations and folklore regarding them.The stars that are projected are bright and by far superior to the short lived glow of the conventional stars.I highly reccomend this product to those who are looking for unique educational toys that can still be played with and used to further imagination."
85068,1,"We received one of these as a shower present before our daughter was born, and loved how soft it was then, but it just sat around for her first few months. However, once she hit six months and started needing a lovey to sleep with we pulled this back out and then bought another one so that she has one for daycare and one for home (after everyone in our house being sick this past weekend I may buy a third just so we have a back up in case of emergency!). These blankets are super super soft, and our daughter clutches hers with both hands right up next to her face as she falls asleep!"
40365,1,"Both my girls have always been Pampers babies. I have tried Huggies, but they are just too bulky with the same absorbance. I like the idea of Huggies' diaper shape, slimmer I the middle. I wish Pampers would come up with diapers in that shape, then it would be perfect for my girls."
60824,0,"We are parents of a 12 week old and have battled with the Genie since we received it as a shower gift. The directions don't make sense and it is very complicated to replace the liners. UGH! Also, would it have killed the designers to make a foot pedal to lift the lid? And the two lids opening on opposite sides of the canister has made me pinch my fingers TWICE. UGH! The first two or three diapers also un-twist and they end up in the same compartment. The idea is great but the Diaper Genie needs a complete redesign."
158694,1,"This is a great product. We are big fans of the sleep sacks - our baby can kick and not smother himself or kick the blankets off. This is made of light weight cotton, so its great for the spring/fall/summer. Just note that the large is indeed large. Our baby is 19-20 lbs, and the large (officially meant for 22+ lbs) is WAY too big. We will be saving it for a few months down the road, and we bought a medium in the meanwhile."
125022,1,"fabulous! My children loved it. I think that it helped their leg muscles develop, as they were both early walkers. THis jumper seat would entertain them endlessly. A household favorite for a few months"
65985,1,"I am a stay at home dad. My wife and I started the baby off on another popular brand when my mother suggested we use Dr. Browns because of our baby's gas pains. I honestly would not have switched if she did not make the purchase for us. I thought how much of a difference could the bottle make in reducing gassiness. After about two days we noticed a small difference but did not realize how much of a change occurred. After switching back to the old bottles (Because we thought the difference was not significant enough to justify the extra cleaning time needed for these bottles) is when we noticed how much of an effect Dr. Browns had actually had. Not only was it more difficult for him to feed with the other brand, he started having these tremendous gas fits again. After a full day we switched right back to Dr. Browns. Worth every penny! Even if you have invested in another set of bottles."
144471,1,"I have purchased these bags for about a year and a half now, came to me based on a recommendation from a neighbor friend. I loved them when I first got them and i still love them; even my mother-in-law comments on the fresh smell of the bags! I store them in multiple places within the house as well as the diaper bag and in my car. They come in handy for cleaning out garbage from the car incidentally. However, this latest shipment of bags is noticeably different. The bags are a lot thinner than they used to be. I haven't used enough to tell if they are of lesser quality but this does bug me when a good thing changes."
152132,1,"As a grandparent, I have limited need for a child booster seat. Although safety is my major concern, I am also concerned that the seat should install (and uninstall) without the need for a degree in engineering. This seat fills the bill."
47943,1,"We have owned this gate for 3 years now. The first time we used it, it gave us great peace of mind. We installed ours at the top of our stairs so the children could play upstairs and I didn't have to worry about the bonus room door being left open and the toddler wondering out and tumbling down the stairs. I love this gate. But I probably love the customer service more. Our first gate only lasted 3 days before something broke in it (I think it was a design flaw that had since been corrected). I called the company and within 10 days I had a replacement gate at no cost to me. Just last week, I was putting the gate back up for the next baby and I discovered the bottom mount was broken. I called and without any more questions than what my address was - had a replacement part in 3 days, again at no cost to me. I love a company that stands by its product - especially when that product protects my babies."
167458,1,I was looking for a down comforter for my baby and finally found this and I think I am satisfied. The quality looks good compared to the price.However I wished it is square quilted instead of striped quilt.
41022,1,"We have tried most brands and have always come back to these. No leaks, no rashes, just a happy baby. Our daughter is moving around a lot now and we have had no issues at all. The per diaper cost of the 148 pack from Amazon is the best I've found (with no tax or shipping cost.) And having them show up at the front door is the only way to shop."
31774,0,"It looks like a lot of thought went into this bag. I used it recently on a vacation. It holds a lot of stuff in a lot of places. The bag itself is made very well with padded shoulder straps. The problem is that even when the bag is empty it is heavy. It was kept in the stroller at all times -- too heavy to carry. It is a little too bulky, but has removable compartments on both sides. It kept getting stuck when trying to take it out of the bottom of the stroller to get something out. At one point the strap in the front with the bungee corded section was stuck and broke. Overall, a very functional bag, but too bulky and too heavy."
154475,1,"I have been using the Seventh Generation baby wipes for over two years and I love them. I see that Seventh Generation has changed their packaging and I am wondering if they have also changed their product? I may just be over-tired or half crazed since I am constantly dealing with a two year old and a two month old, (I probably am both of those things anyway:-)) I do think these wipes seem a hair thinner than the ones in the former packaging. I will admit the difference is slight and the company probably thought barely noticeable, but since I go through about a case of wipes a month (wiping a lot of butts over here!) I do notice a difference. No real big deal but if you do not seal the flap back on the package, your wipes will DEFINITELY dry out...and fast. I still love the product and it is definitely head and shoulders above the other wipes with chemicals and annoying fragrances. I would still recommend these to anyone who wipes a lot of butts and other body parts like me on a daily...okay hourly basis."
176974,0,"It seemed like a good idea. So did the Fisher Price Aquarium. But in truth, we've tried them, but we don't use them. The humidifier in our baby's room (and you definitely need one of those) makes great white noise, and that's what our baby likes. Every baby is different, but this product just didn't do it for us. It EATS batteries also."
133535,1,"We switched our 11 month old daughter to these bottles just this past week after all of the BPA stuff was publicized. She was on Avent bottles, which worked well, but we tossed them. These bottles actually work better than the Avent bottles. My daughter absolutely drains these things when she drinks from them. They seem to flow really smoothly and she isn't working too hard to get the milk. Great product so far, very happy."
90131,1,"To be honest, when I first read the box (when my son was a newborn), I thought to myself, why would I ever keep my baby in one diaper for 12 hours (ewwwwww!) but the second he began sleeping through the night, I figured it out (hah!).These diapers are great and we have never had a morning blow outs, despite our son sleeping 12+ hours a night and definitely releasing a lot of substance into the diaper during that time. Moreover, he tends to roll several times at night and gets up and plays actively in his crib for a while (before we realize he is up) and even so, with all the movement, bouncing and a full diaper, there haven't been any leaks.We've put him in other diapers overnight and he's blown through all of those."
42842,1,"I like this wrap a lot and I am really into baby-wearing. The fabric is really soft and it comes in so many nice colors. My daughter loves it, too. My only problem is that it's a little complicated. It's not easy enough to get it on and off. And when my baby wakes up and wants to be fed, I'd really like to be able to get us out of the wrap faster (sometimes I am able to just shift her around and feed her in the wrap). My only other issue is that it's very warm - and I live in a hot climate. She can't wear it for too long without getting overheated and fussy. I don't think this will be as big of a problem next summer, though, when I can use . I've started using the maya wrap more, because it's easier and cooler, but it's not as versatile. If I had to choose between them I'd choose the moby."
41057,1,"Pampers are not the cheapest diapers, but they have worked the best so far, and we have tried several other premium brands. The Cruisers seem to be the same quality as the Swaddlers, which we also used. They are softer than others, and fit much, much better. I highly recommend these diapers."
2567,1,Fits great and there are no more little white fuzzies left on my baby's bottom after she uses the diapers.
40736,1,"Amazon is out of size 3s right now in these, and I am so upset about it! I never thought I would be a person to be so loyal to a product like diapers, but these are the softest and most absorbant diapers. We have never had a leak with these, unlike just about every other brand. My baby can sleep 12 hours at night and wake up dry. They are truly the best!"
24620,1,"The hands-freeness of this gate makes me so happy. I can walk through it with a baby in my arms and other junk in my hands, and I don't have any trouble getting it open. The foot pedal requires a lot of pressure, so my five year old has a hard time getting in and out, but that is okay because sometimes I want to keep her out of the kitchen, too! The installation was a breeze, and the gate has not moved a millimeter since I put it up despite being pulled on by both the baby and the five year-old. And what pleases me most is that I cannot find a place anywhere on the gate for fingers to be pinched at any stage of being open, closed or closing. We are using one extension with this gate. The measurements of it (the gate) and what space it will fit (with/without extensions) is accurate too."
161217,2,"I had originally liked the idea of having a bath tub that could convert to change with my daughters growing needs. I also like the fact that it was adjustable for easy storage. The water leaked out the first time I tried to use it. You need to push down on the middle to ""snap it into place"". It was very hard to snap into place. It has suction cups on the bottom to hold it in place. After pushing down on the middle I could barely get it back out of my tub!"
43197,1,"I bought this after using one of those bulky systems that converts to just about everything. This is our last child, and I learned two things from my first two sons. I only need an infant carseat and affiliated stroller for about the first 9 months. By then my boys are too big to be in those little carseats, plus they hold themselves up well enough to sit an a much more convenient umbrella stroller (we really like the Jeep ones.) So I bought this. I had read reviews about who the steering was all crazy, and the second time I used it, I saw what people were complaining about - it was because the front brakes were on. Once I took them off, it worked just fine. No this stroller will not 4-wheel like a lot of the bulky system strollers out there. If you really think you will need a 4-wheeler, don't buy this one. But taking my son to the park, at the store, normal everyday uses, it was perfect. Many people complained about not being able to get things in and out of the basket. To that I have to wonder: what the heck were you putting in there? No, it won't let you slide a HUGE diaper bag in and out. But again, by the time I had my 3rd child, I had learned to slim down - I realized I didn't need to take their entire room with us everywhere we went. At most I need diapers and wipes, period. But I could also fit my purse, a water bottle, some toys, a blanket and some snacks in there just fine. No different than when we had that big bulky system thing. Your child will not ""pop out"" if a) he is buckled in to the carseat properly b) if the latch has ""clicked"" since it is the exact same as with any carseat base in a car and c)if you slide the red tabs OVER the carseat. If you do those three things, no toddler is going to be able to disengage it, people. Like all strollers, this product is susceptible to damage, people. It has its pros and cons, just like every other stroller out there. But it worked for me, suited my budget and didn't take up my entire trunk space either. If I had it to do again, I would buy this stroller....again."
119037,1,"I'm about to be a first-time mom, so I spent weeks and weeks researching different travel systems, reading reviews, etc. The big selling point for this one was the one-handed steering and folding. My boyfriend suffered an injury that rendered his left arm almost useless, so the one-handed operation is a big deal for us. And this product far exceeded our expectations. Assembly is a breeze. It took me fifteen minutes, while 34 weeks pregnant, to put it together. I love how sturdy it is! And it looks amazing!I've come to the conclusion that this system was designed specifically for parents with a disability similar to my boyfriend's. I've seen other travel systems in person, and was actually very concerned about how well he would be able to operate it on his own. Most travel systems have multiple latches and require both hands to operate. But my worries have been put to rest. Everything can be done with one hand. It even has a handle in the center of the console specifically for one-handed steering. I had my boyfriend test it out to make sure he could fold it, unfold it, and remove the car seat with one hand. It's so much easier than we anticipated. The only thing that absolutely requires two hands is adjusting the position of the handle on the car seat. That, I can understand. It's a safety issue, and leaving the handle up doesn't interfere with adjusting the umbrellas or anything, so it's not a big deal. Another reviewer said she calls this product ""the Cadillac,"" and I can totally see why. It just looks gorgeous! I would definitely recommend this to any new parent, but it's an absolute MUST for parents with disabilities. I have friends who have different brands of strollers, and you just can't beat the ease of operation with this one.It does have a couple of cons, although none of them are a big enough deal to affect the 5-star rating for me. First of all, it is large and takes up a lot of space, even when folded. It is also a bit heavy. However, I have a PT Cruiser, and it fits in the back of my car just fine. Even as heavy as it is, I can still lift it (I'm now 36 weeks pregnant) on my own to put it in and take it out of the car. My boyfriend can also lift it with one hand, and although it's a bit harder to maneuver the heavy stroller into the car with one hand, it can be done without too much headache. And I'd prefer something heavier and sturdier to something lighter and flimsier, anyway. Also, I've noticed other reviewers talk about how it doesn't stand on its own when folded. This is true, but a stand-alone feature wasn't on my list of priorities when buying a stroller, so I really couldn't care less whether it can stand on its own or whether we have to lay it down when folded. Again, an absolute MUST if you or your partner have a disability. But it's a gorgeous, sturdy, simple-to-use travel system for any parent. This is by far the best buy for the money."
2232,0,"I was using pampers Cruisers with Dry Max for a long time and did some comparisons. I wanted to give the Baby Dry a try since it's still Pampers, but cheaper. Baby Dry did not have the Dry Max, but was softer. After several weeks of use, we have realized that you pay for what you get. The Baby Dry does not hold as much, my son would wake up wet from leakage and many times, his poop would leak out too! Since I ordered 3 boxes trying to save money we only use this diaper during the day and change him more frequently. We purchased more Cruisers with Dry Max and use those when we are out and during the night. If you have a little one who wets a lot during the night, this is not the diaper for you. My son is 14 months and this was just not right."
184863,0,Picture is not what the product is that I received. The item I did receive was not bad even being the product I did not expect.
3370,1,"I love this paciifer! It makes me laugh every time I see it! It also made my son and daughter in law laugh!Sturdy packaging, fast shipping!"
143420,1,"These are the 8 oz reservoirs. I only needed one, but have two. It's always good to have extras since the one that needed replacement fell inside the dishwasher and melted."
74440,1,This Cars flatware set is a must have for Toddlers. I purchased this set for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it. He is a big fan of Cars. He also has a table and chair set for eating meals on to match is his new flatware. It's washable and durable.
76036,1,"I love these trays so far- the lids seem to fit, I haven't had trouble getting the cubes out, and they've survived the dishwasher. However, the cubes are not 1 oz as advertised- they are more like 3/4 oz if you fill each compartment exactly to the brim. So in reality with puree you'll get even less than that per cube. But as long as you know that going in and can compensate by using more cubes they're great."
122467,0,"I got these a couple days ago and finally got around to breaking down the parts. For what you get, it's a good price. I'm currently testing the putty on two stars to see if I have the same problems reported by other users about it not sticking very long. I wiped down the spot where I attached them with a wet & dry cloth, since I know dust and grit can stick to ceilings as well as any other surface. I have flat paint on my ceiling and it's slightly textured, also. I can imagine the putty might adhere differently to a porous surface like flat paint, as opposed to a gloss, so maybe that has something to do with success rates. I agree that it's probably not enough putty for everything.Overall, they are looking promising, but I don't think I'll be using most of the large plastic items, since I just want the constellations. I may use them to make a hanging collage, but we'll see. Also, the sticker sheets represented in the seller photo are not correct. Mine had planets and a lot of little circles (small planets?) and comets on it; I have added photos to help the visual shoppers out there. I have not yet had a chance to test out the glow extensively, but from what I could tell in my closet, they are really bright for a few minutes and then slowly teeter out after that. It's more than enough for the person or kid that likes to look up at the stars before falling asleep.Someone said they can see the putty behind the stars? I cannot, so perhaps those individuals were using a black light. The putty is white (stars are yellow-greenish), so I can see how that might be the case only with the black light. The stickers probably won't be too visible in the daytime unless your room is darker or has colored ceilings, but the plastic stars definitely will be.Oh, also the sticker stars are about the size of a fingernail and are the smallest of the bunch. They are not teeny like they seem in the images, however. I expected and hoped for eraser size, so I'm a little disappointed there. The largest ones are about 3"" from tip to tip. The next largest are about 1"", then .75"" and .5"". The stickers are barely smaller than the smallest plastic stars.UPDATE: The putty is holding fast for me on my flat-paint ceiling. I rolled it into a ball and then mashed each star down. On the other hand, the glow is not as great as my initial tests showed. I just charged them up on the ceiling and they lasted about a minute. I'm disappointed, since another set of stickers that I had about ten years ago lasted for a good 30. You always get less than what you pay for..."
96994,1,"This is a great investment. Small enough you can velcro to the crib, car seat, vibrating chair, stroller-- etc. The soothing sounds are so relaxing, even I want to fall asleep. We received this as a baby shower gift and are still using it near two years later."
11321,2,This item worked fine for 6 months and then the reciever died while we were on vacation - just started snapping rather than broadcasting the baby. Tried to contact Fisher-Price via the web to report problem but they've designed the site so that you loose interest and only provide phone numbers.Cheap price = cheap item. If you only need for the Newborn stage than maybe.....
161814,1,"I think the 4-in-1 bathtub is the greatest. I originally put it on my registry because it looked good but I am happy to say it works wonderfully. I love the insert that allows the baby to lay back and still have easy access to wash his back. I also like the fact that it changes as your baby changes. The only drawback is that the place where you put the ring for the bath seat is a little difficult to clean, but cotton swabs work great. This is trully a must have for new moms."
179706,0,"We used ours quite extensively for short and long-haul flights to test it out.**Be sure that your car seat is on the list of seats compatible with it, and you should be fine.If you really want to get it, go for it. It's rugged and can take travel abuse. But here are some things to consider...Positives:- Very practical, no need for a stroller and a separate car seat, you can check your stroller and just use that when you get to where you're going and plop this bad boy into the rental car and you're off.- Rolls around ultra quiet, great wheels.- Can be pushed as well as pulled when you are just strolling around waiting for a flight and trying to keep the kid focused on something other than waiting around.- Best used on really long layovers or for trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific flights, or if you suspect you may have quite a distance to travel between departure gates. You can run with this item if needed, it handles like a carry-on bag, just remember... the weight you feel is your child, not bottles from the duty free.- If your little one is a car-seat-sleeper, it'll be like they never left the family car... good napping for them means hanging on to your sanity for a bit longer.- Our baby loved it, smooth ride, good naps, great view (apprently)... lots of giggles when running through airport.Negatives:- Bit on the expensive side- Doesn't stand on its own without the car seat, it tends to roll away when there is no seat attached to it.- Without a car seat attached, it's hard to put into an overhead bin or under the seat in front of you as the wheels push up one side, meaning it's always slanted when lying down.- If you are short-haul travelling within North America only, you don't really need this item. If you are staying only a few days, you could rent a car seat along with the rental car at your destination, or even cheaper, you could lease one from a baby equipment rental place like ""weetravel"" or ""babysaway.com"" or something like that. If your trip exceeds 4 or 5 days, this unit may be worth it, so you can take your own car seat with you without checking it in as extra luggage.- Most people don't expect you to drag your kid around near ground level and only see you holding a handle, as some folks are pushy at airports, they may bump into the seat or child accidentally... you need to be more alert, which may be hard considering airport environments, jet lag and other cultures which find it acceptable to stand within your ""personal space"".- You will likely have to separate the unit from the car seat for seating and during flight (we tried to leave the seat attached to the unit on 4 different types of passenger aircraft, and it wouldn't fit no matter what we did). So... remove baby, remove seat, store unit, place car seat on flight seat, secure well, re-secure kid to car seat, pack carry-ons and equipment, now you can sit (dripping with sweat from all the work you just did and annoyed at all the ""stress"" travel causes in your life). NOTE: the unit does NOT always fit into some overhead bins, though it does fit easily under the seat in front of you, and if not, flight staff offer to store it for you in the front or rear of the plane.- When placing under seat in front of you, the unit may roll away on its own if/whent he plane banks, so you need to step on it or put something on it.- If you don't put the strap that holds the car seat to the unit through the right place on the car seat, you reach the end of the tie-on strap sooner when tightening one to the other, and you may (will likely) damage the rubberized plastic strap that comes with this item. I have no idea how to get a replacement strap.- If you bring your car seat on the flight, it's because your child has their own assigned seat (so they have a purchased ticket too). If they don't, your car seat will probably just be in the way, which means it may be best to check the car seat or leave it at home, making the purchase of this item pointless.Overall we were happy with the item, depending on the trip, its length and its intended purpose. When these all matched, the item was great. The item is pretty light and easy to assemble and carry, but we would use it only for kids under the age of 2 for whom we purchased a seat on the flight and this only on long-haul flights. Only useful if you need a car seat AND a stroller at your destination. If your child is old enough to go without either a car seat or a stroller, it's probably not worth the hassle."
45014,1,"This mat has held up wonderfully to washing. The toys also can be carried along (car seat) and our son loves the music switch. Now he has learned to move it from on to off. This toy was worth every penny, I don't think a day in 6 months has gone by we haven't used it."
175991,1,"I love my K'tan! It's easy to use when your out and about or on your own. I recommend going a size smaller as it stretches a lot. Other than that, it was a great buy!"
68907,1,"Great absorbency, and baby stays try all night (she usually sleeps more than 10 hours per night without changing)."
83466,0,"It is okay, it works to protect the mattress. Its made from material thats not so great though. I think I could have found better for my money."
44241,1,"I got this because I was travelling alone with my 20 mo old on a plane and liked the three different ways you can carry it-I used all of them. The compartment is roomy, but the flap over the top closes with a single magnetic snap that is impossible to close if the bag is quite stuffed. It is great around town though and love the easy acess changing pad."
149681,1,"I bought this highchair as a birthday gift for our Godchild, who just turned 2. I decided to put it together myself and it was so easy, with great instructions. Very sturdy and cute! I have two children, ages 3 and 5, and they immediately launched into playing with it after I'd put it together and had a great time making a little birthday cake and serving it to one of their dolls in the highchair. They loved playing with it. The birthday girl loves it too. It's provided hours of imaginary play and seems like it is going to hold up very well. It easily holds dolls up to 18"". Great price, too. We'd gotten a wooden highchair for our daughter when she turned 3 and, while it is sturdy and timeless too, it was a lot more expensive. This one is a great deal! I'd definitely recommend it."
126880,1,I will admit that I was a pampers fan and always purchased Pampers. Up until Amazon didn't offer free shipping on the Pampers. Then I noticed Huggies with the Subscribe and Save. Free Shipping and sent to us every month!! These diapers are equal to the Pampers and I have been very pleased with them.
155540,1,Great product and company to work purchase from. Got the sheets quickly! Soft jersey and exact color. Will shop with again.
109047,1,This kneeler is great - especially if you have hard tile floors and a toddler that doesn't like to take baths! My knees were killing me so I decided to purchase this. It is so comfortable and you can store the shampoo and body wash right in the pockets. It folds up and attaches with Velcro so you don't have to worry about it taking up space on the floor when you are done. Wipes clean and absorbs water. Never had a problem with mold or smells.
35977,2,"I bought this because of all of the great reviews, the price,and because it looked comfortable and stylish. I watched the video and did not have any problems putting the wrap on in less than a minute. I did however have problems with two out of five positions that it advertises. When I put my baby in it facing out, his circulation in his legs always gets cut off. If I loosen the straps, I feel like he's going to fall out. I was terrified when my husband noticed that his legs were turning blue! I also hate the sling position. You are supposed to be able to nurse in the sling, but it is impossible! Same problem, it's always too tight and he's suffocated or too loose and you have to hold his head the whole time. I do like the wrap for the facing in position, but that's it for now. I will be buying another carrier."
142595,1,"This is a wonderful product for nursing. It fits a lot better around you than the Boppy. It is also more comfortable when sitting in a chair with arm rests. However, after you are done nursing or when your baby out-grows it, you will not have much use for it. The Boppy on the other hand can be used for tummy-time and to help them sit up.However, as a nursing pillow, this is your best choice."
53989,0,"I really did love this mirror - it was just a little confusing on how to attach it to the car. It would really work great if you have the head rests in the back seat - but if not you will have to pin it to the back of the seat - and after you remove it, it leaves little holes where the pin was. Also - if your child is in an enfant car seat the mirror has to be pretty low down to see him/her and you will have to move your rear-view mirror down to see him/her every time which is rather inconvenient. Once my son moved to a bigger rear facing car seat it worked a little better. I would look for other options before choosing this one - I am sure there are better out there!"
125895,0,"I have never had problems with Huggies, no leaks, fit my son well. I just finished my last package of Baby Shaped (with Lion King theme) and picked up a new box, which is now Snug & Dry (with Mickey Mouse theme). The first thing I noticed was the change in quality. These new diapers are MUCH thinner, and less substantial. The elastic waist and tabs are not as stretchy. These are now more in line with Luvs, but still priced higher. If I'd known of the quality change I would have bought Luvs instead. I was always willing to pay more for the quality of Huggies. Now I feel I've been douped."
144768,2,"There are no complaints about construction or price for the item, but I would advise others to really take to heart similar comments on the firmness of this mattress. It is beyond firm -- it is almost like a brick with cloth over it. My daughter could not sleep on it comfortably, and I returned the item."
63201,1,This toy box looked great on the web site but I was skeptical about the materials it might be made of. Not to worry - this unit is well made and well worth the price. All the parts were in excellent condition when unpacked and the wood tone and grain are quite attractive. Easy assembly with detailed instructions - took just over 1 hour. My one minor disappointment was the half-inch holes in both side panels that screw the unit together to the front and back panels. The heads of the screws are color coded to the honey tone and recessed into these holes but it would look nicer if they had plugs to cover them up with. The final test is yet to come from our 6-month-old grand-twins who will be sharing this toy box!!
93484,2,"I bought this for my son about 7 months ago and he did like it at first but it should be made a little bigger. It hurts his legs when using the deflector part and you have to use that part with a boy. Maybe this potty is better for a girl but definately not a boy. Also it is hard to clean with too many cracks and sometimes it leaks. The only part me and my son liked was he liked to pull the container out by himself and empty it thats why i gave it the 2 stars i did.I never even used the music part of it so i cannot review that but i think that it is useless.I have decided just to buy a soft kids seat for the big toilet and a step stool. I would not buy this potty again. I would recommend you research other pottys on the market because this is no good.If fisher price improved this potty by making it a little bigger for boys and improved some other things, then it probably would be the best potty."
158874,1,"These bottles are wonderful and really work to reduce gas. However, at the risk of sounding like a lazy (or exhausted) mom, there are a lot of parts that have to be taken apart and then put back together just right for cleaning and sterilizing. If colic is an issue, it is definitely worth it, but my daughter does just fine with drop-ins bottles."
145417,1,I'm not one to buy something just because people insist it's the best thing since sliced bread. I found that my daughter didn't like vibrating chairs and many other infant 'must haves.' THIS product however we tried at a friends house first and WOW - she absolutely went GA GA. It's fun. It's exercise. It's educational. One of the best purchases we made. She gets some time in it every day now.
147182,1,"I recieved this bedding set as a gift - I did register for it - my husband picked it out b/c it is not too girly and we ar having a girl. It is very good for either sex - it has cute whimsical spirals in the blue fleece and yet the animals are not too boyish looking either. I've washed everything and dried on the lowest setting and did not have a problem. The only thing for me is that the bumper should tie to the bed, but the crib we have has the front panel that slides up and down - so the bumper pad goes with it if it is tied to the spindles. However - you would have this problem with any bumper pad."
2658,1,"I love all the pamper products, We where using some other brand and they where not holding much of anything. My son seems to like them better, I love the overnight ones too they hold so much!"
102776,1,"I received this diaper pail at a shower and it has worked fine for me. I haven't had any problems with the springs or anything like that, and true, it can smell, but that's no big deal. It's still worth the money that you save, with it being cheaper and taking normal trash bags. We just spray air freshener into it after we take the full bag out and before we put a new one in and it works great."
165238,1,Very absorbent. I might switch to lesser quality diaper because it kept my 2 yr old too comfortably dry and its not good for potty training.
107959,2,"I bought the Avent Isis before the birth of my first child on recommendation from my sister and several other moms. I also planned to rent a hospital-grade pump (due to anticipating a need to pump frequently) but there wasn't one available for me when I was discharged, so the Isis was all I had for my first four days home. Well, my daughter was not a strong nurser, my milk came in with force, and this Isis pump was utterly useless!! There was absolutely no suction, no matter what I did. I couldn't express a drop with this pump, even after hand-expressing to relieve some of the engorgement! We took it apart and reassembled it multiple times following the directions (we meaning my husband, mom, a friend, and myself) to see if we'd bungled something, but nothing worked. Even my lactation consultant agreed that the pump wasn't working. I finally got the hospital pump a few days later and was much relieved to get some real suction going to relieve the pain until my daughter got the hang of things! The only good thing about the product was the bottles it came with, which we love. Wish I could get a refund for this useless hand pump...."
162763,1,"I like these snack cups! They are fun for my son to use, and they have definitely helped my car stay cleaner. Easy-to-hold handles, too. I would prefer if they were brighter colors and plainer (no animal faces or branding). The designs begin to wear away after a few runs in the dishwasher. Otherwise, great product! Cheaper here than elsewhere, too."
22024,2,"As many others have stated these are great in theory, but poorly executed. The plastic of the bag itself is very stiff and tears easily. The seal is awful. Hard to close and leaks. This is especially frustrating when you are trying to use this for convenience at work or to transport milk elsewhere. I haven't even bothered to try and freeze milk in the bags because I was too worried about the bag tipping and leaking all over the freezer. The lansanoh bags are much better. I have even taken the tabs off the medela bags to use on the lansanoh bags. Don't waste your money on these bags. It ends up costing you more in time and lost milk! Plus the Lansanoh bags are cheaper!"
114057,1,"Fits perfectly in our dining room chair, lovely color ( I got the green & blue). Baby loves it. Easy to clean and store. Great for traveling parents. Does not take up extra space in the house. A winner!"
68736,1,These diapers have by far the best flexible/stretchable side tabs out of any diaper to make a really good fit... much better than Pampers Baby Dry in my opinion.
131834,0,"We had 2 Decathlons (Tiffany and Hampton prints) for my daughter, and I loved them. The material is plush, the buckles are easy to click in, and they are just nice seats. I bought 2 more in Sahara for my son, and it STINKS. The material is so flimsy that it feels like some cheapo thing without padding and the buckles stick when trying to click in or out. Had I know that the material was different, I would never have purchased this pattern. Shouldn't the material be the same quality over all their carseat fabrics??? What a waste of money since I now have to buy different covers. I won't have my son sitting in what feels like flamable material for the next 4 or 5 years."
77933,2,"We were really looking forward to using this on our first trip with our baby. It worked great at the beginning of the trip, wheeled wonderfully through the airport and down the aisle of the plane but after just one use, started to rip all along the bottom, which in turn damaged our brand new car seat. What this bag needs is a heavy duty plastic guard on the bottom so that it won't tear if it rubs the ground. I am only giving this item 2 stars because I think it is poor quality for the price, which is quite steep considering it barely made it through a single use! I would be willing to pay $50 for a better quality bag. If redesigned with a rubber guard, I would give this item 5 stars."
137291,1,"It's a great pillow but is does take up a lot of room in bed. If you are sleeping by yourself, it's great but my husband complains that he doesn't have any room becuse of my new giant pillow. Besides that, I love it."
163135,1,"It's smaller then I imagined, a little less then 5 inches tall, but it's an excellent bank. The design is adorable and Domo actually looks like he's eaten part of his snack.But be careful. It can't fall down. It's not made of plastic or such durable materials."
136694,1,"I bought this for my soon to be born daughter and my 25 month old loves this toy. She loves watching the story setting which has her favorite animals.. a lion, bird and whale. She also loves her favorite song twinkle twinkle little star setting. She jumped into bed lastnight and watched it and fell asleep. Also tonight. I am impressed that this has helped so much with her sleeping on her own. I am grateful for this toy!!!"
171004,2,"I this stroller would be great for walks with my son.... after 6 months the screw that holds the frame together fell off while I was pushing my son!! Customer Service took for ever to get through and because I am on the west coast they were closed the first 5 times I trid to call! Once I got the replacement parts, they did not fit!! Once I got another set of screw and spring and fixed it myself. It lasted for about 2 weeks, when POP the screw and spring want while walking threw a busy intersection at night!!! Back to the store that stroller want. Came home with a new one that seemed in better shape. This time it lasted 3 months, Just as I want to start jogging after a short warm up POP!!!!! the spring and screw want flying! NOT safe at all to push a child in when the stoller is falling apart! this stroller just needs to be scraped!"
161027,1,I like that this bag is appropriate for a man or a woman. Because it's a messenger style bag it's comfortable and the straps can be easily adjusted for size. I can simply reach down into any of the pockets while still wearing the bag if I need to. It's made of a sturdy material with big zippers and the three large pockets on the outside make it handy to store things you need to get to quickly.
44113,2,"Ok, so it fits over our weird lift up shower valve and it protects the kids from the sharp edge of the faucet, but it grows mold an is pretty gross. I soaked it in bleach ad it smells better but it didn't really get the stains off. Also, the soap drips out if you leave it in. Wastes the bubble bath and makes for a slippery surprise in the morning when you step into the bath tub. I haven't seen any other product that fits over our faucet, so I'm keeping it for now, but i don't love it."
69861,1,"I have a 6 month old baby boy, I switch all the brands at the beginning. In my opinion, Huggies Supreme is the best, fit and no leaking but too expensive. Pampers Swaddlers is good too, but when my baby squeeze too hard, still leaks everywhere, for that kind of price, it's not worthy at all. Luvs is just as same as the Huggies Baby Shaped but cheaper and softer. The worst is the Pampers Baby ""Dry"", leaks everywhere and really saggy afer pooing and peeing, it made me turn on my washer everyday.So far I used 1 pack of size 2 and lots pack of size 3, so far I am going to use size 4, for the price and quality, Luvs almost have nothing to complain about, if it sold out in the store, I would buy Huggies Baby Shaped instead.I think every baby have different shapes and situations, if you keep trying, you will find the best diapers for your baby."
153568,2,While the product itslef is nice- and this may or may not be the fault of Miller Hme- the lamp shade came to me completely crushed and when I contacted fed ex- they said its not their responsibility. I also find that Miller home does not respond to customers emails.
4421,1,I Bought this item for my best friend who has a baby on the way because I know how all the women think and what the wife always gets at her baby showers. I knew if I had a baby that I wouldn't want to carry around one of those flower filled diaper bags and I figured whould any man? Anyhow he was estatic about it. It really looks like a laptop bag or work bag and he is happy to cary this anywhere he goes. It also seems to be very durable and functionable so I would suggest this to any father that still wants to look and feel like a man.DadGear Messenger Diaper Bag - Pro Grey
90427,2,"I have been pleased with the regular pampers size 1, but I'm very disappointed with the Baby Dry Size 1. They are significantly smaller than the regular size 1 diapers and do not cover the back of my baby, so it's been one mess and clothing change after another."
122118,2,"I registered for the this carrier because I didn't want to ask for the expensive Baby Bjorn carrier but I wish I had asked for that one. This carrier is not easy to minipulate and put on there are far too many buckles and straps. The material is very scratchy and every time I have attempted to put my baby in it he got upset and was very uncomfortable. My sister who has a Baby Bjorn uses it every day. Her baby loves it and is very comfortable because it's made out of soft material, it doesn't have a bunch of straps dangling around, and it is so simple to use. If I could go back I would have registered for the baby bjorn instead of the cumbersome Snugli."
175368,1,"This chair has worked well for me. It is very basic and of solid construction. The seat has 3 levels of recline which are nice too. This is a good buy. I was able to purchase for under $50.00 and got free shipping. I did a lot of research on basic highchairs available and this was by far the best, for the price I paid."
61129,0,"This is an excellent product, it really is an improvement over the diaper pails our parents used when we were babies (in the 60's) I'm talking. There are some drawbacks: if you don't push the diaper to exactly the right place in the retainer clip it will push through, not be sealed and thus ruining the whole concept of each diaper being &quot;sealed&quot; in it's own little bag. This mostly happens when you first change the packing material and the diaper pail is empty. After two years my lid broke off, but honestly the thing had been put through the ringer and had done it's duty.The bad thing is once your child begins solids and the poop gets REALLY smelly, the diaper genie will smell too, even with just one little stinky diaper in it. I got to where I'd empty it the minute a smelly diaper went in there because nothing, I mean NOTHING will hid e that smell. After it broke I threw it out and simply threw each diaper into an old grocery store plastic bag and took it outside. That was a real chore, but I only did it with the dirty diapers. The wet ones could hang out in our closed garbage can till the end of the day and not bother anyone. Still, I'm thinking about getting another one because I'm tired of taking the diapers all over the house! It really is a great invention, honestly. It's helpful to take it OUTSIDE to empty it when it has smelly diapers and let it air out and spray it with lysol!"
45630,1,"We looked at a lot of these floor gyms before registering for this one. I'm so glad we did! Not all of them have a mirror, which I didn't think would be a big deal, but the mirror turned out to be our son's favorite feature. He's 3 months old and can be entertained for almost an hour at a time with this gymini. It's also very easy to pack up and take with you."
102045,1,"I am breastfeeding our 2 month old and got this bottle warmer after reading the reviews for several different bottle warmers. This is great for that supplemental bottle or when dad or another person feeds baby with a bottle mom has pumped. We have found, like other reviews, that it's best to use the lower amount of water since it can overheat the bottle. We love the fact that it heats very quickly, meaning NO SCREAMING BABY! It is simple to use and small enough to even carry along if needed."
30947,0,"I received a sit 'n stroll as a hand me down from a friend when my child was 3 years old. It is a great concept and as a single mom needing extra help when possible, we have taken it on 4 trips but I actually don't feel that safe with it. The issues of our stroller is it has a latch for behind the seat but the tightening mechanism doesn't go tight enough for rental cars with the latch really close to the seat. The other issue is the seat is supposed to be strapped down in the airplane with a lap belt but most airlines lap belts aren't long enough to go over the seat. Out of 5 different airlines, only United (in premium coach) was it long enough to work properly with the chair. I've been jerry-rigging the seat with the seat belt. Then in rental cars, the seat sits low so the child can't see out and we've had some car sickness as a result. The seat belt is once again a pain b/c you use the 5-point harness and then use the seat belt over that which is a hassle to deal with the in/out frequently and isn't comfortable for the child's arms. I see it now has a latch mode which would be a lot more convenient in rental cars but still wouldn't address the shortness of lap belts on the plane. I haven't found the seat to be too big - it is too tight with the armrest down so just move the armrest up...If you're willing to deal with those issues, it is VERY convenient to have the stroller/car seat altogether and the wheels pop-up and down very easily."
60701,1,"I have used the diaper genie through 2 kids, and it was one of the best presents I recieved. Like any diaper pail, it will need to be emptied about every 4 or so days to control smell (and fullness). Also, I don't twist after very diaper...only the stinky ones. This makes the refills last SOOOOO much longer. It took us a while to figure that out. Used that way, I find the (blue) refills reasonably priced for how long they last. Big enoigh to fit even the largest size diapers in. Never had any leaks either, and it never really gets dirty since everything is covered by the liners. Hardly ever have to clean it, just a little Lysol on the top where you touch. Babies have never gotten into it either."
29497,1,"I bought these for use on a camping trip and ended up reusing most of them despite my intent to use them as disposables. Now I keep a few extras in the car, diaper bag, etc. for when I inevitably forget a regular spoon.They're the perfect size for little mouths and great to swap in when someone wants to just teethe on the spoon instead of eating. (My other spoons have metal handles.)Also, the handles are easier for ME to hold than the flat metal ones - the contours give me a better grip.We're starting to try to get her to feed herself and I'm offering her these and the toddler-sized take-and-toss spoons to use. So far? Messy but fun. ;)"
104281,0,"This product is pretty good , kitten cant climb it , hes not sure what to make of it... the down side if you dont have the proper cutting tool like i didnt its basicly going to be a crooked cut theres one area that is like that that my kitten can still get under ... the hole puncher that came with it broke after a while .... used a nail to make wholes where the puncher could not reach"

42731,1,"Being able to put baby in the wrap has made my life much easier! I'm able to run around the house doing errands that I hadn't been able to do prior. I have a different brand moby that has stretch to it, however I prefer this 100% cotton one as it feels more sturdy and baby feels more secure. Baby is only a few months old right now and so far this is working great. The only thing I don't like is how long it is. I end up having to tuck the ends around me and putting it on car-side is difficult as the material drags on the ground when I'm putting it on. It would be nice if it came in different sizes for mom and/or baby (ie. infant, 6 mo, toddler, etc..) Overall? A good purchase, priced right, and very useful."
136895,0,This bouncy chair is not really sturdy enough for any but the lightest of infants.The four month old we bought this for made the chair sag so that it was more of a horizontal experience than a sitting up one. Other than that it is pretty well made - it just needs to be beefed-up.
59582,1,"There is nothing more to say. I have tried other locks all of which my son was able to magically open or manhandle his way right into were he wasn't supposed to be. These locks made all the differance in the world. They require a little bit of extra time to install but they are with out a doubt, The BEST child proof lock available."
25742,2,"These cups are made of polycarbonate plastic, which is a known toxic plastic, especially unsafe in food/drink storage. Nuby makes other two handled sippy cups that are made of safe polypropylene plastic. Cups made of unsafe PC plastic are usually clear and hard, while cups made of safe PP plastic are softer and ""clouded"" plastic."
53141,0,"These were the first table-toppers I purchased and I loved that they helped contain messes and also kept my little one from eating food off of a table. But, I soon encountered a better solutions... there are other table toppers that are biodegradeable (the Pooh ones are plastic). The other brand also is mostly black and white, and my my older kiddo enjoys coloring on them. Overall these type of products are great for early self feeders, but I prefer the ones that will biodegrade."
39417,1,"This is the second halo sleep sack that I have purchased. Lovely fabric that is warm, but not too warm, easy to care for and comfortable for my 6 month old."
18508,1,"My second daughter had terrible colic and when I found out I was pregnant again, I was determined to do everything I could to head colic off at the pass. These bottles have been worth every penny (if you have problems with a colicky baby I'd also recommend getting an Amby baby hammock BTW) - I couldn't give them 5 stars though because of the hassle with mixing powdered formula (see below).Tips: I agree that you should just go straight to the 8 oz. bottles; don't bother with the little ones.To clean them, if you use a dishwasher it's easy after the initial sterilization in boiling water. You will want to get two dishwasher baskets: the kind that is specially designed to hold nipples and a large open one with no dividers of any kind. We got ours at Babies 'R' Us. I simply disassemble the bottle, put the long thin pieces standing upright in the large basket so the dishwasher can clean them throughly and the second part of the vent piece fits in there as well and I place them around the base to keep the tall pieces from falling over. I put the nipples and the rings in the other basket. When I'm putting together a bottle, I grab the two venting pieces from one basket and snap them together, the nipple and ring from the other basket and put them together, screw on the lid and I'm done!If you don't use a dishwasher, they give you a little brush. And, since they give you a brush in each package of bottles, you'll easily have extras to leave at grandma's house for bottle-washings there.As far as leaking, I have discovered this: all over the literature it says, don't shake the bottles, don't shake the bottles. They aren't kidding!!! We have used both powdered formula and concentrate. Concentrate is easier, you can just pour the mixed formula into the bottle. For powder you absolutely CANNOT mix it in the bottle. If you swirl it, the powder doesn't dissolve. If you shake it, the bottle will leak. This is true even if you shake it w/o the valve, just with the lid screwed on. You just can't get around it. If we are travelling with these bottles, we have to pack the powder, bottled water, the empty bottles, and one clean empty jar (like a jelly jar) with a lid for each bottle we want to make. We measure the amount of water using the lines on the bottle, pour it into the jar, add the powder, put the lid on the jar, shake it thoroughly, pour the mixed formula back into the bottle and put the rest of the pieces on it. Because this IS kindof a hassle, I have to give these bottles only 4 stars... but as far as a happy and colic-free baby goes -- you won't ever have cause to complain!"
164693,0,"Pros: Cheap,Free Shipping to home directlyCons: Has Chlorine and other Synthetic ugly stuff when compared with other productsMy daughter had a serious Rash, we turned to Earth's Best Organic Chlorine free diapers and It is worth it."
6717,1,I like Pampers Cruisers because they are slimmer and seem to fit better than Huggies or other brands. My girls NEVER have leaks at night in these diapers and they don't seem to tear inside (rip and let out those absorption crystals) as often as other diapers.I was bummed when Costco quit selling Pampers because I have twins and go through a lot of diapers. I was happy to find them on Amazon--with free shipping they cost the same (and they were delivered right to my door!).
5514,0,"While the graphics on these cups are super-cute (my son loves them), the finish on the cups didn't last and the graphics are chipping away. The spout is also softer than other cups so there are now teeth marks in the cups (where I don't have any on the other cups) and I'm afraid that bacteria can hide in there. We've been throwing them out as they get bad enough that I can't clean the spouts well enough. I don't think I'll be buying these again."
59183,1,"I agree about the leaks and how there are times the children have to be changed. I grew frustrated as well. But the leaks we had were not due to the formula leaking out of his mouth but of the actual nipple falling into the formula.I have to admit, I like the bottles and the system. I felt my son was able to latch on to the nipple and my breast with no problem. I wish this system would have been available when I had my oldest. I am definately going to use the system again. The bottles are easy to clean and they are very durable."
52473,2,"I have tried this swing with my son since he was born. At first I thought he was too young to use it, so I tried him in it every month. The same thing happened repeatedly. He kept falling over to the side and his head would hit the blue bar while the swing was in motion. (the belt was appropriately fitted) Fortunately, we were there to get him out of it as soon as it happened.It seems that the seat sits too upright letting him fall over. I even tried holding him up with rolled up hand towels to the side of him, but that didn't work. Not to mention that the dangling objects also hit him in the head. The last time we tried the swing we taped those to the side, but once again he fell over hitting his head.I will not put my son in this swing again, ever let anyone borrow it, and never donate it to any organization."
150401,1,"This is a pretty good jogger. This was my first jogger I ever bought so I can't compare it too much. The only inconveniences I found were that the seats are in a very reclined position which can be a bit annoying to your kids if they don't like to lay back. Also, the front wheel is stationary so you have to lift the back end in order to make any sort of a turn. I believe both of these features however are the norm in joggers unless you pay a fortune. I feel this is a great product for the money!"
71165,1,I bought this for my daughter as soon as she was born. Whenever she crys I put her in it and within 2 minutes she will stop crying. Highly reccomend.
61641,0,We have had this monitor for 2 years with our daughter and at first it was really helpful. It's rather easy to travel with but eats up batteries quickly. When we first bought it we had no problem with static but as we traveled and used it continually the static problems got worse. I don't know if it was just over use or product problems but with another baby on the way I'm looking into getting a different model and besides my husband hates it so much that we don't even use it anymore.
122602,0,"This high chair is really cute, and I LOVE the bar between their legs in the front, so you don't absolutely have to use the straps (if you don't have a climber, that is). But the material is not machine washable. Who on earth decided that a baby high chair would be a good ""dry clean only"" item? Really bad choice on that side. But that being said, I've had this chair for 3 years, and washed it in my machine on the gentle cycle. While the padding under the bum is all bunched up (we put a towel at the bottom now to make it comfortable), the rest has actually held up fine to the washings. We've also only hung it to dry. Overall, cute product that is a pain to clean."
183975,1,"I was a Pampers only mom, don't get me wrong pampers worked great when my son was in the swaddlers size, those are the only diapers I would use, and I still to this day recommend the pampers but swaddlers only, after that, it was leak after leak after leak. My son is a thin active baby, very active, and I tried Cruiser's, Huggies, everything and believe it or not only the luvs work to keep everything in. The pampers wouldn't survive the overnights! In the morning when he finally woke up the stuffing from the diapers would be stuck to him! So much for absorbency, I have never had that problem with the luv's. I will always recommend them for anyone needing size 3 and up, size 2 I would still recommend the pampers swaddlers."
130129,1,"This item has been a true lifesaver!! Ok, maybe not lifesaver but at least a sanity saver!! We got this swing when my son was about 2 months old because our old swing quit working (it was a totally different kind). From the beginning, my son LOVED it!! There is excellent padding on the seat and enough head padding that the baby's head doesn't just flop around when he falls asleep. We don't feel that the motor is very loud, it's really more of a ""white noise"" kind of sound. This has really helped my son get into a napping pattern. The only downside to the swing is that if you want the mobile and music to keep going, you have to push the reset button every 7 minutes. That becomes really inconvenient when you are trying to get something done around the house. All in all though, it is completely worth it!! I will be very sad to put it away when my son is too big!"
133189,1,"It's great! Operates like any foot pedal trash can, but for diapers. I try not to discard the bags too quickly; we've had a couple of day's worth in the can and no odor. If you have your hands full of baby and soiled diaper, you don't have to mess with a twist cap or anything. The cap and trapdoor seals off the bag and mess. We definately recommend this product!"
151441,2,"I got this gate for the top of our stairs. It fit well and by using the gate adapters, I didn't need the extensions at all. So measure carefully if you don't want to pay for more than you need. The gate works fine, but needs constant adjustment on the side screws to keep the gate closed properly. And we hardly ever have the gate closed, only when my daughter is allowed to roam the landing. I can't imagine how much worse it would be if we were opening and closing the gate constantly. The hands free gates are so much better. We use them constantly and so far have not required adjustment (unfortunately, they wouldn't work on the stairs) so I'd recommend them over this gate."
181756,1,"perfect product for a gift and very well packed, I do recommend this purchase !! the box looks like a jewelry"
50552,1,"I love my Snoogle and should have bought it earlier. It is expensive for a pillow, but getting a nights rest is priceless. All of my non-pregnant friends and my husband want to steal it.As some earlier reviews have mentioned, the fabric cover is cheap and scratchy. I put a regular pillow case over the part that touches my head and that's made it comfortable.There is room for improvement, but overall an excellent purchase and I highly recommend it for pregnant ladies!"
135387,1,"We purchased this monitor as a replacement for the FP Sights & Sounds monitor which was five years old and had seen better days. We had consistent reception problems and static with the FP model. I love the fact that it comes with two receivers (one we keep in the bedroom and we keep one downstairs), and that all units can be plugged into A/C power.I was pleased to find we experienced no static or reception problems with this model-I'd gotten so used to hearing ""white noise"" that I actually kept checking the Graco model to make sure it was on!My daughters are five years old, but we still like to have a monitor in the room in case someone falls out of bed or wakes during the night. I'm very satisfied with this product.The only thing that kept it from getting five stars was the volume-I really wish we could turn it up louder."
160395,1,"bought this as a replacement for my son's first potty seat, this one is much better. not as padded, which means it won't rip open and harbor a bunch of bacteria. my son's old one used to collect urine underneat of it in the plastic part, this one doesn't at all, it's perfect"
120411,1,"My husband and I researched all types of monitors and bought this one as soon as we saw exactly what it did. Let me tell you, it was the best purchase we ever made. My son has been sick several times with chest colds and I have never worried about putting him down for the night. I don't have to go it and check on him every hour or so because I know that if he stops breathing the alarm will sound.We started using it in his bassinett and put it in his crib when he moved in there and I have never had any problems with false alarms. I would spend the money again in a heart beat! It truely is a life saver."
141486,2,Dd is 8 months and she is bored with this toy. She is standing and cruising on her own. However she can only play with the front when she is sitting because it will roll the other way if she's leaning on it.
118799,0,"I recently bought 2 of these carseats, but was surprised to see that the back does NOT disconnect from the seat. I purchased these because I thought the back would be a nice option for long trips, but could detach the back and use just the base for everyday. Not so. It doesn't disconnect (like the Graco brand).Has a nice option to raise & lower the back to adjust the the height of your child. Nice material, moving armrests, 2 drink holders, etc.Just didn't work for me."
161040,1,"I had ordered another rocking chair via Amazon that was poorly made, pieces broke and did not fit correctly, etc. Finally I sent it back and ordered this chair- I almost didn't based on one bad review here. So glad I went with my gut instead of dismissing it based on one review! The chair is solid, big enough for her to enjoy for years to come, and best or all, was a breeze to assemble. The ""paper mache in the drill holes"" complaint in the bad review is mistaken-it's how the drill holes are constructed. No complaints at all, and the chair was a better price than the first disaster I ordered!"
159163,1,"I have a 3 month old son, and he is in love with his bouncer. We got it as a shower gift, and are pretty glad!I find that with most of the aquarium line, its more along the lines for playing or for occupying your baby (bright colors, loud cheery music ect...) and thats what we use this bouncer forIts great for keeping my boy happy. The fish are so funny to him and he loves the mosic. It bounces nicely and my 2 1/2 year old even tryed sitting it (but after a stern warning has stayed clear ever since!) So its durable! I dont know how long we will be using this, our son is a premie, but in a month we will be looking for an exersaucer, or will be taking out our old one from the basement (thats probably whats gonna be happening!) So this is great for a newborn, but once your baby gets active, I think its time for more stimulation, although this will be around for about another month or so before it moves down to another expecting parent!"
130645,1,"That's what my husband and I nick-named this swing. Just like most other reviewers, we cannot sleep without it some nights. Our daughter was a preemie (34 weeks) and has loved this swing from the moment she came home a week after birth. The mobile is not ""too loud"" like other reviewers said...and the fishies really keep baby entertained. I couldn't have survived the first 3 months without this swing.The best advice I can give new or expecting parents...DEFINITELY BUY THIS SWING!!!"
22448,1,I'm a little disappointed with this Pack n Play. I've seen others that are heavier duty than this one. I bought this to use in our church nursery.....I hope it holds up.
19866,0,"These bowls are nice in that they don't slide around all over the place and the fact that they come with lids. Like any other suction cup, they work much better if they're wet when you stick them. Unfortunately, they don't work the way I had hoped. I stuck the bowl to the tray, and by the time I walked to my kitchen counter to get the food to put in it, my nine month old son had already thrown the whole thing on the floor. Seriously, he figured it out IMMEDIATELY. Once there's food in the bowl, he's usually distracted enough to stop pulling at it, but as soon as the bowl is empty, or he thinks it's empty, the thing is right back on the floor. That said, it is nice when we're out to dinner so that I don't have to put his food right on the table, but if I don't keep filling it up fast enough, someone will probably be hit by a flying bowl."
31480,0,"I don't love this product but it gets the job done. My biggest complaint is that it's very flimsy and the plastic rods that hold the bottles tend to fall off a lot so, the bottles fall to the ground and I have to resterilize it. So, yeah, not a good purchase."
41887,1,"This is the only bottle/cup my 10 month old will drink out of! We've used others, but my daughter ends up chucking them across the room. This is the only one she doesn't let go of and she actually drinks out of it. The first day we bought it, she gobbled up all 12 ounces! She loves it. It is durable because she's set it aside a few times and it fell, but still hasn't broken. Also, it DOES leak if you tip it towards you because the hole on the top makes it easier to sip out of. But, she doesn't tip it anyway and it comes with an easy-to-use cap. I'd say this is the best sippy/straw cup out there (and we've used lots)."
41111,1,"We've been using these for almost 2 years and I have no complaints, except that I can't wait until we dont have to use them anymore :)"
70750,1,"This chair is a great place to put your baby so he/she can:*take a nap (in the reclined position)*watch a Baby Einstein video*play with toys*safely watch Mommy take a bath/quick shower*eat solids (I use it as a feeding chair)*sit near Mommy and Daddy as they eat dinnerEven though it is supposed to last until the baby is a toddler, I would not recommend using this chair once your baby can sit up because it can tip over. You could drag it back out once your child is big enough to use a rocking chair, but I do not plan to use it as a rocking chair. I would treat it as any other bouncy chair and store it once baby no longer lies around."
141735,1,As soon as i got this walker my 6 and a half month old started walking with it. He never had any problems with it tipping and he even used it to pull himself up. He loves to open the barn door to hear it say peek a boo i see you. He is now nine months old and starting to walk on his own. He still wants to play with the walker and still uses it. I love this toy and so does he. All five stars from me.
155661,1,"I bought this for my son a couple of years ago. We used it lots when we were out, especially when he was potty training and just couldn't wait. It's wonderful. Just wish it was easier to find the liners.Another reviewer said there are sharp edges. Ours doesn't have any sharp edges. It does collapse, if the legs aren't snapped up properly; but otherwise isn't a problem.Our daughter is potty training right now and we have it ready for her whenever she needs it. It will also be great for our upcoming car trip.UPDATE:My daughter is now 5 years old. We've had this for so many years and it's saved us many times. We still have this in the back of the car for those rare emergencies. What a wonderful buy."
47379,1,"I have two cameras attached to this monitor and it does the job just fine.It's true that the cameras sometimes intefere with each other and the picture isn't always crystal clear but toggling the ""A/B"" switch back-and-forth solves the first problem and who needs/expects a cystal clear picture in the dark from and easy to install, wireless, and relatively inexpensive device?!During daytime naps when the kids' rooms aren't pitch dark, I can see them clearly enough to know to if their eyes are shut but at night when their rooms are dark I lose lots of detail but can still see clearly enough to know if they're moving around, on their back vs. tummmy, etc.Their might be better ones out there, but this has worked well enough for me that I never bothered shopping for a different one."
133957,2,"With winter coming, I thought my daughter would appreciate warm wipes instead of being constantly startled by having a cool wipe on her behind. Of course I love the idea of a wipe warmer but once I got this one home and up and working I was a little disappointed. I should have read more carefully b/c I expected this to be battery-operated as well as having a plug-in, but no such luck. That makes it a little inconvenient b/c no mom changes her baby at the exact same place all the time. The warmer is also heavy and not very easy to carry around. I also wasn't thrilled with the idea of having to buy new ""pillows"" every few months to keep the wipes moist. Who has time to think about that with all the demands of motherhood?"
141292,1,many thing to touch and feel. great music and a helping hand for a crawling baby who wants to stand and walk.
48996,1,We purchased this for our puppy that we getting. It has worked wonderful for helping w/housebreaking. Our puppy also likes it when she can get away from our youngest child.
44928,1,"I have a demanding job that unfortunately requires me to sometimes work and be away up to 24 hours at a time. This pump has been in use for the better part of the last 3 years with my 2 sons, sometimes pumping 4-5 times per day. It still works like new, is pretty quick to pump both sides and is the only way I can imagine maintaining my milk supply when work gets crazy and I'm not home.I have no complaints at all and am glad I invested in a good quality, powerful pump. Love it.For the poster who was having trouble positioning the dual bottles then turning on the pump, um... you CAN turn it on first, then position the bottles- it will still work. That's how I do it. There are also straps that are sold (separately) to hold these things in place so you can have BOTH hands free while pumping. This didn't work very well for me though.Love it."
80316,1,I bought this mattress because my 2.5 month old would not sleep on the 1 or 2 inch mattress that comes with most bassinetts and mini/portable cribs. I use it with the million dollar baby annabelle mini crib. I am very happy with both the crib and the mattress but it took a long time to find the right sheet. I bought 3 different kinds that didn't fit including the koala care sheet other reviewers mentioned. It fit on the mattress but it was pulling on the edges. If it were to slip off it would probably lay on my baby's face. So if you get this mattress and you want a good safely fitting sheet that is also not paper thin get a gerber knit crib sheet (t-r-us $8.99)-the one for a standard size crib. It fits on great and doesn't slip off or get bunched up!
11794,1,"My son, Jimmy, is 19 months old, and we have been told that he may need a g-tube for nutrients because formula alone would not be enough for him his whole life. The problem is, Jimmy doen't have the &quot;normal&quot; swallowing reflex, nor does he have the muscle control to chew well. We tried the baby safe feeder for the first time today, and I am in tears writing this review at this very moment! My Jimmy was able to chomp down, and continued to do so for 1/2 an hour! He doesn't have to worry about gagging or choking, and it is obvious that this is making a world of difference in his exploration of food! I highly recommend this feeder for babies, disabled or not, and to children (or adults!) of any age with a disability effecting their swallowing reflexes and ability to chew. I am excited to say that Jimmy may well be able to eat one day without the feeder due to his response to it so far! It is, literally, teaching him to eat!"
28250,2,"I may have received a ""lemon,"" but my experience with this chair so far is poor. Several pieces in the box were significantly damaged (large dents and deep, long scratches in the wood, one of the cushions was separating at the seams) and I spent 20 minutes on hold with the company to get replacement parts in ""maybe 15-30 days - if they have them""...As far as comfort, the chair is alright... Just remember - you get what you pay for. If you don't mind a chair that may arrive damaged, screws that don't line up correctly - basically a cheap product that was made in China, then this chair is for you. If you want something that is sturdy and built to last, I would look into higher end gliders made by another manufacturer (Dutalier, Best Chair, etc.)."
106680,1,"Worth every single penny and then some! I orginally registered for the famous ""Diaper Genie"" but was so thankful that my mother-in-law purchased this one instead after doing some research of her own. No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that! I am even thinking of purchasing one for my upstairs as well. Definitely the best one on the market."
81835,1,"I purchased this pump for my first child. I was able to pump 8-10 oz at a time (having to switch bottles, of course) while nursing on the other side. Customer service was great! When my puppy chewed up the breast shield, they sent me another at no charge. Only problem I had was the milk backed up into the pump once, was without pump for 2 days, but again, customer service replaced at no charge! If you can't afford a pump in style, buy this one. Also have a dual first years pump and it was wonderful when I went back to work. Cut pumping time in half!"
177272,0,"First of all why is this product listed under toys?Now to the point. I bought this hoping that it would help replicate a pillow top mattress as my son has been co-sleeping with me and he has become accustomed to my mattress and I want to try to transfer him to his own bed. Sadly this isn't as plump as what it looks or as much as what other reviewers try to make it out to be. I even tried it out by placing my son's mattress on the floor and lying on it myself, his mattress still feels hard as a rock! Plus his mattress is a simmons beauty rest foam mattress with square corners, so it's slightly bigger than the average mattress and this pad still fits loosely on it, but I will add that a well fitted sheet seems to help fix this problem a little. So far it has held up in the wash, but mind you I wash it on cold and dry it on extra low. My son is just over 4 months old and I don't have any worries about SIDS because of this product. To give you an idea of the thickness of this pad it is just over the width of my pinky finger so about 1-2cm."
104941,1,"This is an excellent pure soap, organic and fair trade, wonderful lather and rinse factors. I will definitely purchase this and the other varieties of this soap in the future. I did expect a stronger citrus fragrance but overall am not disappointed."
179477,1,We have not used it on an airplane yet but the carseat fits great!
29225,0,"Like most baby bjorn products, this is attractive and sturdy. However, for a stool to be used by a young child while washing their hands at the bathroom sink, it's a bit short. I'm sure some people buy it for other uses, but I bought it exclusively for this purpose. Its appearance fits well into the decor of my bathroom. With its help, my three year-old son can barely reach into the sink to wash his hands. If it were a few inches taller, it would be far more useful."
83558,2,"I bought this rail from Bbiesru's store, I put it together fit the mattress perfect 4"" -10"" you only press 2 blue handles on front and pull up and folds down for easy access well I folds down two or three times and i placed my baby in the Twin bed he's 6 month but he doesn't like his crib and I was happy!!! the rail was folds down then when I wanted put up....one side fell down!!! I was very angry and my baby laughter Now I don't want any more this rail is the WORSE thing , I'm looking for another one."
23932,2,"This is a great idea, but like another review said, they can raise their arms up from the bottom of the arm wrap which makes the fabric bunch up around their face. I bought a fleece one and a knit one. The fleece one would be too hot so I used the arm wrap from the knit one with the fleece sack. It's easy to get on but the fleece is bulky and makes it hard to burp them. I'll probably stop using it because I'm afraid of the wrap getting pushed up into her face."
159848,0,"I purchased the Summer Infant QuickSmart Stroller for a trip. My guess is that most people who are interested in this stroller buy it for the ability to travel on airplanes with it. The problem is that LxWxH measures about 52"". The plane limitation for my trip was 45"". Thus, it exceeded the maximum volume requirement. I called the Company and the person who picked up the phone could not confirm that it would fit in airplane overhead bins. The stoller itself seems like a great design; however, the bag is so flimsy, it basically cannot be used. Unfortunately, I purchased the stroller to fit in an overhead airplane bin and based on the failure to fit in overhead bins, along with the poorly constructed bag, forced me to return the item. Amazon.com was excellent and credited my account for the return."
72449,1,"I bought this seat cover 2 months ago. I have a Chevy Silverado Crew Cab and it covered the whole seat, and had extra cover which I had to fold over the back of the seat. I feel confident that it will protect my car, as the material is thick."
98137,1,"I bought this after my cloth cover that came with my highchair became worn out after so many times through the washing machine. This cover is a great neutral color, washes incredibly easy, and has no folds or tight corners for food to get stuck in, which was a major problem with the cloth cover. Most of the time, I just wipe it down with a damp cloth after use, and it looks like new. I'm only sorry I didn't buy it sooner."
84547,2,"I have used a Medela Pump in Style for two babies, but I got caught in a pinch recently and was forced to buy another pump while out-of-town. Even on the maximum suction setting, this pump barely worked. I had to massage/squeeze my breasts to express any milk. Getting any reasonable amount of milk takes a ridiculously long time and the motor is REALLY loud. I'm sure I would have been better off buying a manual pump for this occasion. I have a newfound respect for the fine piece of equipment my Medela is...worth the extra $[...]."
129264,1,"My 4 month old grandson seems to love this toy. He grasps it and turns it around and chews it, of course!"
165981,2,"We have been using Pampers sensitive ever since my son was born. When he turned one year old, Pampers sensitive doesn't work well during night time anymore and I was on a mission to find a good night-time diaper for him. I purchased Pampers Baby Dry (or should I call it Baby Wet?), all I can say is that it didn't work at all. We have to change diapers every 3 hours both in the day time and night time. Definitely a waste of money and we had to throw out half box of the unused ones.My 12-month-old boy usually sleeps through the whole night. It just hurt me so much when he was waken up by wet diapers and needed to take another 30 minutes to fall asleep again. Pampers Sensitive is the way to go for daytime, and for night time I happily found Huggies Overnite."
144938,1,I bought the wubbanub for my sister's son and he loves it! It is easy to manipulate and super cute!
35004,1,"OK, first off I will admit the first time that I tried to strap this seat in my car, rear facing, I felt that it was not reclined enough for my baby &amp; almost took it back to the store. My little guy just turned 8 months, but he only weighs 14 1/2 pounds. However, he is 26 1/4 inches long. I was soon to find out that the seat was fully reclined &amp; strapped in correctly. The reclining position had nothing to do with the carseat, IT WAS MY CAR. I called a technician that a friend recommended to me, he came to my house, free of charge to take a look at the seat.My car is a '99' Honda Civic in perfect condition. However, it has a samll back seat, which I think most Honda's (4 door sedan) are the same way. Because of the way the seat of MY CAR is, he had to build up the carseat by using a pool noodle, cut in three sections to make the carseat recline in a 45* angle. He put all of his weight across the front of the carseat, which by the way he was a heavy set man, got it in the perfect postion at 45*, used the locking clip to hold the belt in place, and now the baby is perfectly reclined right where he should be. My son LOVES his carseat. The carseat is installed so well that it does not move when you try to push it from side to side. When the baby falls asleep now, his head does not drop forward. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a very good carseat.Stop blaiming the carseat for all of your troubles. Drive your car over to the police station of the town that you live in &amp; they will install the seat for you at no cost to you. However, even if the did charge wouldn't it be worth your little ones safety?BTW-I have been using this seat for over a month a few times a day, &amp; I have never had to worry about the seat straps twisting. I LOVE this carseat. I would buy a Britax in a heart beat if I felt that this seat was not good enough for my child. If anything go over to Babies R Us &amp; compare the two. You will find that the Alpha Omega Elite actually is more comfortable &amp; has another growth position more that your precious Britax. Just because it is the most expensive, does not mean it is the best. Besides Eddie Bauer wouold not put his name on a carseat that was not safe. The Eddie Bauer one (Manchester, I think) is the EXACT SAME CARSEAT, only brown suede. They are both made by Cosco."
22425,1,I was very happy with how quickly the package came and how easy it was to assemble. I wish the mobile was a little nicer it seems to be very cheaply made but I guess it is true; you get what you paid for!! Haven't had any problems yet but I'm still waiting for my little one to arrive so I will have to write a review later on.
126629,1,Our latest granddaughter needed diapers in a hurry. I was told by a friend who works for pg that Amazon was the best place to buy diapers. We buy Huggies and save 30% and they are delivered right to the house.This is convenient and saves gas too.
156821,1,"This exersaucer is perfect for my child. She keeps entertained with so many textures and colors. The only feature that i don't like is that once the lights and sounds stop, the battery cannot be replaced. Save your money and buy the next step down without lights and sounds."
175072,1,"Can't be beat for the price. My son's been using it since three months (when he outgrew his infant tub), he's now 6mos old and it looks like it'll serve him thru at least 9mos ( maybe more) if there are no serious growth spurts. Ours doesn't leak, the suction cup stays on, inflates in about a minute and has traveled well. He's comfortable, doesn't slide around and has a ball in his little tub, especially when we make it quack."
60062,1,"I was hesitant to buy because I hadn't seen it in the stores, but trusting the reviews, I bought it. It's wonderful. My son has just moved to the sitting up side, but he was completely comfortable in the reclining side. He loves his bath!!"
5645,1,"hate your kids getting hurt by the tub fittings- do something about it! these cute rubber animals do the job- bath time can be the most fun time of all, and this removes alot of the downside potential and stress...my only complaint would be the water slops out of the mouth more than pouring, but besides that it is cute and effective. Thanks for this nessecary item designer folks."
131956,1,This is an excellent space saver and alternative to a bulky swing. Works perfectly with Graco snug ride carseat and is a lifesaver for rocking baby to sleep in the middle of the night. Have used for all three kids and recommended it to all friends having babies.
21523,1,Being a new parent in germany it helps out a lot while traveling i wish i could of found it sooner
141025,1,"Thirty years ago I got this grinder to introduce my children to solid food. It was fantastic! A little of what we were eating ourselves through the grinder, maybe mixed with a little milk to make it softer, and the baby had something new to eat. I googled the name Happy Baby Food Grinder so I could buy it for my first grandchild expected very soon. I hope it lives up to my experience because I used it through two children despite its being made mainly of plastic. I can't begin to estimate how much I saved by not buying baby foods. To quote an old commercial, ""Try it. You'll like it."""
145116,1,"My daughter gets so fustrated that she can't move much mind you, she's 3 months old. This has helped out so much. She has toys to play with and can bounce all day! I especially love that I can collapse and transport it to another room easily!!!!! Best thing I ever invested in!"

170700,0,"I recently purchased this mat in order to use it for my 3 year and 7 year old sons as a form of punishment. Both children have tremendously improved their behavior due to the worry of being placed in ""Time Out"" on the mat. This has been great, but unfortunately it has led to adverse effects on other family members. My husband seems to adore the time out mat, and it is creating a mixed message to my kids. At first he would mildly misbehave and then go put himself in time out and sleep for the remainder of the evening as the rule in our house is when you are in Time Out then you can't talk to or play with anyone. Now it has grown to the point where he is finding things to do, and routinely coming home telling me that he was misbehaving all day at work and took an extra long lunch so he needs to be in time out from 6 PM when he gets home until 8 AM when he goes to work. My kids are becoming confused.Last weekend he became so intoxicated at the local tavern that he arrived home and said he needed to be punished and remained in time out from 2 AM on Friday night until Monday at 8 AM when he left for work. Look ladies, buy this for your kids, but make a concentrated effort to keep your husbands from finding this as my husband refers to it a ""utopia."""
96352,2,"I wish I'd read some reviews on this sippy before I bought it, but as I picked it up at Walmart for $2 I wasn't really thinking too hard about it. It was cute and I'd seen a lot of toddlers with these cups at playgroups.The straw is hard to thread back through after cleaning, and the last thing you want when your toddler has decided she's thirsty is to faff around with a fiddly straw.The biggest drawback is the spray factor. Liquid pools in the top portion of the straw, you close it and then when you open it - SPRAY! Milk flies through the air. It's a very messy cup. I wish I hadn't wasted the $2 and just gotten her anotherMunchkin Mighty Grip Flip Straw Cup, Colors May Vary, 10 Ouncethat I know doesn't spray everywhere."
37138,1,"The main gate material seems pretty sturdy, but the plastic pieces and mounting screws are softer and flimsier than I would expect. None have broken, but one of the screws bent when I was installing it and they give and wobble a little when the gate is pushed on. Also, the auto-close spring doesn't seem to be closing the gate as quickly as it was initially, after only three months of normal use. It might be very sensitive to how plumb it is, which is hard to ensure because of the aforementioned give in the mounting hardware, even though I screwed the mounting cups into the walls.The instructions aren't very good. There aren't enough close-up pictures showing how it should look when mounted correctly. I didn't understand from the instructions that you're supposed to have to lift up the gate (about an inch) to open it. During installation, you crank the plastic mounting rings tighter until the retractable lip at the top of the gate goes underneath the opposite bar to prevent the gate from being pulled up without the lip being retracted. From the pictures and instructions, it looked like that retractable lip was useless and just jutted out into thin air. I thought maybe I was missing a piece that it would fit into. The magnetic catch seemed a little weak to ensure on its own that the gate couldn't be opened by a toddler.Thanks to other reviewers here on Amazon whose comments I read and re-read until I figured out what they were referring to, I finally have the gate installed safely at the top of a staircase. It looks like it will do a good job, but getting to that point was a brain teaser."
29903,2,"I bought it more than a month ago. I use it once a day to make baby cereals, that's why I chose the cheapest one. After using it twice, it started to leak around the pump handle -- the milk got sucked up into the top part, and the air leaked at the same time. Since it was so cheap, I wasn't too surprised. After a week, the tab of the blue rim was torn, I can't take it out from the pump body unless I have to forcefully pull the valve which I'm not supposed to do -- it's difficult and it damages the valve. Also, it's extremely hard to tighten the pump rim onto the pump body, same to taking it apart. If it is not tightened properly, the suction won't work -- well, it doesn't work well anyway no matter how hard I try. I've been struggling with this horrible thing for a month and I can't stand it anymore. Everyday it takes me an hour to one and a half hours just to get 4 oz of milk. Although I want to use it just once a day for just a couple of months maybe, I'm gonna have to buy a new one. Please listen to my advice, don't buy it unless you're planning to use it for just a few times. Among all of the things I've bought, this is what I regret buying most."
16304,1,Love this product is so easy to keep clean and its a really good size.I also love how it folds up ad really easy to carry.
50026,1,As the Mom to twins this is a must have item!!!! It is very hard to take twins shopping when you actually want to be able to put things in your cart instead of use it as a baby carrier. The hip hamock allows me to go out with both babies and grocery shop. I can put one baby in the front of the carriage in the seat and put the other in the hip hamock and go. The carrier is not 100% comfortable but is the best I have seen out there. It takes the weight off of your arms and back which is really nice. IT is very easy to get the baby in and out of. This is a gret product!!
157492,1,We bought this product for my daughters nursery. It was fairly easy for my husband to put together. Once he did put it together everything fit very nicely and it looked higher end than it really was. Very sturdy and stable. There is also real wood in the drawer and handles. It holds all my daughters clothes great and has a lot of room (at least for baby clothes). I have had it for 2 months now and no problems as of yet. Great for price and I am very happy with this purchase.
55978,1,"I really like this warmer. Its small and it works fast. There is a little water holder that attaches to the side of the unit to keep the water ready for when you need it. Just add the water, put in the bottle and wait 2-3 minutes. The only problem I have with the warmer is that I use water for the bottle that is room tempature so if I leave the bottle in the entire warming time it gets too hot for my baby to drink. So I just take it out after 1 minute, check it on my wrist and it is usually ready. If you are taking a cold bottle from the refridgerator and warming it, you can leave it for the full warming time of 2 - 3 minutes. I highly recommend this warmer."
84282,1,"I have several toys from Fischer-Price so I am already a believer of their products. This swing is another addition to the fun and enjoyment that my kid would attain.This is safe in that it has the seatbelt and the chair is sturdy enough. I know because I have a 2 year old baby boy that is using this swing every day. This is also easy to install, I installed it myself! (Proud mom moment)And because this swing chair has a tray, I could just feed him here. I've tried some other chairs for my eldest son a while back when he was still a toddler and those doesn't compare to this."
137788,1,"My kids are 5 and 2, and they love this so much they use it as a toy at night too. The first night the turtle night light arrived, they both played with it for a whole hour and still didn't want to put it down. They continue to play with it every day. It is so fun for the kids and it's a cute turtle with clear star projection."
160846,1,"I bought this for my husband but after trying several different diaper bags I took it over. It was especially great while traveling. At some point functionality takes over style. This has easy to wear with the baby and carry everything else. It has easy access pockets so you can get to what you need quickly. Really, other than the look (for girly moms) it has everything a diaper bag should."
119402,1,"I find this pillow to be a great helper. It's comfortable and firm, easily supporting my 11 lb 1 month old. I do find it a bit annoying to have to strap it on each time but that is what makes it so supportive. I also have the Boppy and of the two this one is better for breast feeding support while the Boppy is better for ease of use (no need to strap on the Boppy). This is a great help and I would recommend it, especially to first time moms."
153327,0,"I can't speak to how well it works on diaper rashes as I noticed immediately that it stains cloth diapers and had to stop using it.It's also a yucky tan/brown color, which again, doesn't impact its performance... but it's just not the color you want (staining your diapers) or rubbin' on your lil' one's bum!"
28151,1,Love this. My husband was getting confused in my baby's closet whenever he had to get clothe for her and this helps him differentiate the different size clothe.
34307,1,"I love this item. My kids love this stroller. They'r 9months and 18months old. They hold hands, push each other, or mainly just relax and like the ride. They like the fact that they don't have to look over the head in front of them anymore. Its an ULTRA SMOOTH ride. Push with a pinky. My wife too.She actually requests to push the stroller now as before she would never want to push it. The control is unbelievable. Turns extremely well. Storage is fine. Basket is pratical for whatever fits under there. Snacks, diapers, bottle bag (altough for that I have to unsnap one side)and my diaper bags wraps around handle bars fine. The sand where its deep I have to push hard but works better than the usual strollers. Great over curbs and mostly all. Soft enough too for them. The kids like to sit straight up so they'll lean forward sometimes which is my only complaint. Since it is for jogging, the back when its as up as far as it can go, is not up enough for lets say the mall. I used the strap they gave and made up my own thing. Its still worth gettin. The other thing I suggest getting is the bob holder for 2 cups and storage for like keys, cell, wallet that straps across handles for extra convience. This fits through most doors fine. Remember most places are handicap accessible. People always compliment me like in the mall. It great. Oh and the canopy is good enough, if its not, you can buy the extra accessory for more coverage. My lifestyle isn't necessary for it though. Its a great product that my kids love. Last thing, it weighs as much as the graco double stroller. It folds up very easy and fits nice either in my maximas trunk, saturn IONS trunk, or caravan trunk."
102785,2,"My husband and I wanted something cheap and uncomplicated, so we registered for this product. Within the first month, one of the springs on the diaper drop broke and, subsequently, became not odorless."
118629,1,This kit has everything a new mom needs for health care and many of the grooming needs of her newborn. The storage case keeps everything together.
146071,1,"I really liked this product. The only thing that I didn't like is the leg holes are really small. So if you have a very large baby this might not be the product for you. Overall, my daughter likes to bounce and play with the toys. There have been many smiles with this toy from both baby and parents."
70722,1,~I bought this for my sister's new baby...and my sister says it's GREAT! It was simple to assemble and easy to use. I think I've found THE ultimate new baby shower gift!~
72862,1,Don't get me wrong I do like it. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I don't like where the straps are positioned on the seat. Just looks funny. Other then that it works great!!
13692,1,"this is a nice and sturdy little gate. very easy to assemble, but a little overpriced for what you get."
35581,1,Nothing more to say but it keeps kids 100% germ free while shopping!!! My 8 month old loves sitting in it! Washable and great!!!!!!
93312,1,"I was so happy to find this product and for the price it was worth it. We took it on vacation because my son refused to sleep in his pack in play because he said that was baby bed so I bought this and he loved it. He slept better in this then his own bed. It was easy to pull out of the bag and set up. I liked that it came with a fitted sheet and he put his own pillow and blanket on it and loved to go to sleep on it. He wants to be able to use it at his Grandma's house too when he stays over there. Overall, great product for the price and easy to travel with."
44423,1,We had a deck that was not to safety code for railing distance so placed this early this spring and it has been wonderful over the summer. Will see how it holds over the winter. Was fairly easy to put up by myself.
11887,2,"I saw it in a catalog, but didn't want to spend the money until a friend who's the mother of twins got one and came to work with raves about this great thing she'd just bought. I picked one up since I'm paranoid about feeding the bambino anything that might migrate to the wrong tube. Much to my dismay, my son hates it! No matter what we put in there, he scrunches up his little face and pitches the feeder on the floor. We think it may be the texture of the mesh. Anyway, I still think it's a great idea, but my son refuses to be convinced!"
167163,1,This is our second step in protecting the safety of our granddaughter. Both chairs are of high quality and work great. thanks
67703,0,"This fit nicely on my Bob Revolution stroller. But, the ""cup holder"" I was sent, which looks identical to the one in the photo, has packaging labeling it a ""Universal Drink Bottle Holder"" and has a warning label to not use with hot liquids! Maybe they shouldn't advertise it with a coffee cup in it. It seems like it will work OK but it is not as sturdy as I had expected. It seems a little tricky to get the coffee cup in and out for shorter coffee cups than the one shown in the photo."
177247,1,"No, it's not a glamorous item, cute or pretty- but a top notch quaility item that will last thru many washings and can go on to be used on a toddler bed. I love mine. Just an update- 2 years later and still going strong on my little ones toddler bed."
85209,2,This pillow has no where near enough stuffing. Your head is pretty much on the mattress immediately. Plus the fabric finish smell is really strong and doesn't seem to fade. Getting a smaller option that just supports your belly and goes through your legs is a better idea.
132237,1,These cups rarely drip. They are the best that I have found so far as I have tried quite a few. I was looking for cups that never drip but don't think they exist yet.
69118,1,"The Cruisers are a step ahead of other products. It's more confortable, and doesn't cause diaper rash even after long hours. This is definitely better than Huggies Supreme."
75563,0,"the chest was difficult to put together my husband had a task on his hand he was very frustrated, but the end result i still loved it if you look closely at the assembled dresser you will notice alot of uneveness and it is not completely wood brought it for my daycare nursery hope it holds up well the reviews were not wrong wont purchased again only because it is not 100% wood but despite everything i still love it, but i was not the one putting it together. thanks"
132212,1,Very dependable. Almost too dependable...makes it hard for us to put our toddler on toilet training.
136857,1,"This seat is very comfortable for my almost 2 year old and was perfect for when she decided she no longer wanted a high chair but a real chair like the adults. After about 6 months of use, the seat caved in. I contacted Gold Bug and they were wonderful about replacing the seat. (plus, a real person answered the phone!) They even sent me a ""gift"" of one of their other products to compensate me for having to ship the old one back to them. The material is a bit difficult to clean but it is super easy to fold up and carry out with us. My daughter finds this seat more comfortable than another rubber booster seat that we tried."
130056,1,"Haven't used these yet, but we love the crib, and love the fact that our newborn will have the same bed for most of her life;)"
35151,1,"For both kids, this is the only diaper cream I use. I feel good about the ingredients with no cancer causing chemicals. It works really well on normal diaper rashes. If I put it on my baby at night he is clear by the morning. My first son had much more sensitive skin and many yeast rashes- which this didn't treat- but no diaper cream really will. A word of caution though, it can and does stain some fabrics. I try to be very careful about putting it on and not getting it on things. It left many stains in a changing table cover we had."
176296,1,"I've been using the Single Deluxe pump for about a month. I just went back to work last week and I found it easy to use there. The only thing is that I did not realize that I would not always get as much milk as I wanted from a single breast. I need to use both sides to get 4-5 ounces per pumping. Before going back to work, I would only pump in the morning and got that much on just one side. This pump is also on the loud side, but I had read that before buying. I've been using the pump 5 times a day and do not have any complaints at this time about how well this works. I'm also very happy that I was able to get this $15 less than retail."
120002,2,"It is unacceptable that a product made specifically to keep your breastmilk frozen until you need it would leak. We used these bags to store frozen breastmilk, and 50% of the time the bags leak when they are defrosted. If you are pumping exclusively for your breast fed baby, you know how heartwrenching it is to see that breastmilk wasted. I strongly encourage anyone NOT to use this product. The best bags we've found so far are Lanisoh."
166586,2,"I used Pampers exclusively for the first year of my son's life and loved them (Swaddlers, then Cruisers). I stopped using them when they added the Dry-Max, because I heard so many bad things about it. I switched to Up&Up, which I like a lot. I was afraid my baby would have a bad reaction to the Dry-Max. I was under the impression that Baby-Dry didn't have the Dry-max in it. It doesn't say dry-max on the box, anyhow. I got a great deal on a huge box, so I decided to try them. I started using them on Monday, and by Wednesday my son's behind was broke out and inflamed. So now I have 130+ diapers I won't use. Of course, not everyone will have the same problem. But I've tried several brands: Huggies, Luvs, Fisher-Price, generics, etc. and my son never developed a rash. I'm not sure what Pampers is adding to these diapers, but they should have left well enough alone. I will never buy Pampers again."
47014,1,this stuff smells so great you want to eat it. love it for my babes. very mild and gentle. as good as california baby but not the big price tag.
2213,0,"These diapers are very soft and feel comfortable to hand. But they don't secure well. They tend to slide down and create a big mess if you have an active baby. Huggies are the opposite, a little stiff but secure better. So you have to weigh between the two. Personally, I feel the scent is a little too much for babies."
149783,2,"I bought this for my son so he can have things at his fingertips during car rides such as toys, sip cup, crackers, etc. Its very flimsy and loves to bend so things slide down and into his seat where he can't reach them so it defeats the purpose all together. Also, he hates it! He doesn't like it at all and starts screaming now if I try to put it over his legs. So needless to say we don't even use it anymore. If its just to keep his toys and sip cup next to him...if he will let me put the table over his legs...then its fine but not stable enough for snacks or any kind of book activity on."
106294,1,"I love the Diaper Champ! The best thing is, there's no expensive refills to buy, it uses any kind of bag (even the cheap wal-mart kind) and keeps the smell out just as well as a Diaper Dekor or Diaper Genie. I bought one after I had originally bought a Diaper Dekor, because I got sick of paying so much money for the stupid refill bags. It's as inexpensive as you can get, and it works just as well. Hands down one of my favorite baby products; I couldn't live without it!!"
153121,1,"These wipes are excellent when my twin daughters get diaper rashes. They are a little on the pricey side, but they are worth it for bad rashes, especially when you are changing diapers constantly. I prefer to put my girls in the tub for a bad rash, but when we're on the go, these wipes are the next best thing. They are alcohol-free and hypoallergenic, and they do have a slight fragrance, but it is not overwhelming. I highly recommend these wipes, whether you have a new baby and changing diapers often, or a toddler with a bad rash."
56143,2,"To install this gate you have to drill into the wood stair banister. We didn't want to do this. There is an option to purchase an installation kit for $30. We didn't want to spend that much on a gate, as we needed to buy 2. We opted for the Regalo top of stairs gate. They come with a gripper and sturdy Velcro straps so you don't need to drill into wood. I did give the Kidco gate 2 stars because it is easy to open/close and has a stopping mechanism so that the gate doesn't swing open over the top of the stairs."
183836,1,"I got this kit as a gift at my baby shower, and thought it was great, but didn't think I'd use them until she was well established with solids. I was wrong. My daughter is just shy of 5 months and I've been using them for the last 3 months. We spend a lot of time visiting my parents and the larger size bowls/lids are perfect for taking along extra formula without taking the whole container of it for a day or overnight trip. I just washed and kept a couple of scoopers that come with the formula and they fit perfectly into the larger containers. Also, we've just begun rice ceral, so I use the smaller containers for taking that along, also. I've even used it to take things like salad dressing to work for lunch! The sizes are really perfect for small portions. There are so many great pieces for such a great price, and even though I haven't used the utensils, I still love this set of ""baby-sized tupperware."" I would give it 5 stars even if the utensils were missing."
174512,2,"My mom and I read all the reviews on here, and after checking out the mobile in person decided we absolutely wanted this one. Once I got it home, I attempted to put it together only to find I couldn't get the 3rd battery in. Both us and the guys at the store tried their entire stock of Sassy mobiles, and no one could get the batteries to fit. We believe it's because the ""bump"" on the battery won't go over the metal bump on the battery casing. We couldn't get it in enough to even THINK about closing the compartment. Is there a trick to this, or was it just a bad shipment?"
175198,1,"We bought these to help take food to daycare and they hold just the right amount of food for our 10 month old son, can be put in the microwave and come clean on the top rack of the dishwasher...very convenient."
177734,0,"The 4-n-1 Travelin Tot playpen in Garden Safari is what we chose to use in place of a bassinet because the top of the playpen works just as a bassinet does, but we can use a playpen for much longer so we found this option to be much more practical. Problem...the padding in the bottom of the bassinet portion of the playpen is rock hard. We found this mattress and it appeared to be the perfect solution to the problem, but when we put it inside to make sure it was a perfect fit, it wasn't. If the mattress moves all the way to one side of the playpen, it leaves a gap plenty large enough for a baby to roll into and suffocate. The only solution we could come up with was to roll up blankets and place along each side of mattress making it a snug fit in the bassinet.Don't like this solution much at all, but sometimes you have to improvise and it beats the rock hard padding that came with the playpen."
96812,1,"I just bought this for my 6 month old who has been having some trouble going to sleep without noise and music wasn't cutting it. She's a little old for the heartbeat or whale noises, but I can see how those could be great for a newborn. The ocean sounds, however, soothe her right to sleep. I was FINALLY able to just put her in her crib fairly awake at bedtime and she's just so relaxed for about a minute before dozing off. I only gave it 4 stars because of the timer. I wish it could stay on longer. I would definitely recommend this to others!"
99432,1,I love these diapers. I used them in the beginning when they did not have baby flex. They were a bit binding and leaked easily. I then switched to luvs for the price but they did not have stretch tabs either my son was between size 3 and 4 so the extra room would cause leakage. Size 4 in pampers baby dry were just right and the flex tabs are comfortable for crawling and movement. I liked pampers cruisers but they were a little pricey. I love that the regular pampers have stretch for the same price. Now if only Luvs would do the same.
13890,0,"I love these, however the measurements are inaccurate. Make sure you measure the water for the formula separate. Other than that I love the convenience!"
41489,1,"It's worth every penny to have diapers delivered directly to the door since this is an item used daily at our house. With super saver shipping (a purchase over $25.00) there is no cost for shipping. It ends up being 27 cents per diaper for a box of 160 size 3 pampers cruisers. The last two times I have ordered this item, it has been delivered in two days! I am extremely happy with the service amazon has provided and I recommend this item to anyone in the market for diapers."
100556,1,"With subscribe & save and free shipping, these are some of the least expensive diapers out there. Every so often, one of the fasteners rips off the diaper; otherwise, good containment and no other problems."
108596,1,My son can now walk up and down stairs. Be advised - you do not have to purchase extra kits if you need extra parts - each kit has an order form on the back of the directions. You can order an extra mount or whatever.
131249,2,"Our daughter received this walker as a gift from her grandparents, without consulting us her parents, first. I would not have chosen this walker. Now 14 months old, she has never voluntarily pushed it around. The songs are annoying, loud (the 2-level volume switch doesn't make much difference) and often begin spontaneously if the walker is left on. The motor on the ABC wheel is sounds like it's grinding and the wheel comes out of place easily, whirring loudly, not spinning, until fixed."
140733,1,It will loosen up periodically- especially if you drive off-road alot like I do... Otherwise I like it and so do the puppies!
52483,2,"I guess I got a defective model, because it turns on by itself even when it is switched off. We have the bigger version of this swing, the Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle swing and we absolutely love it! We got this Take Along swing as a gift at our baby shower and we were excited in putting it to use with our baby, but I was disappointed when it would just turn on by itself and the motor was LOUD. I had to take the batteries out of it so it wouldn't wake us all up in the middle of the night. I guess it has to go back to the store, hopefully they'll allow me to return it."
81546,2,Why do they call this a monitor? The feedback we get is comparable to what you might hear at a rock concert. The first time we tried to use it it woke up our baby. To make matters worse everytime you walk by the thing there is enough static to make you jump. I received this as a shower gift and threw out the box before I tried it- big mistake!!
50145,0,"I'm on my third child and I can honestly say I've tried just about every kind of baby carrier/sling on the market. I have had the original Baby Bjorn from the start of my first child and still use it a lot. It doesn't offer the side feature. I've tried the slings that simply go over your shoulder and for my height, 5'4"", those never seem to work. I've tried other kinds that are back carriers, side carriers, etc. They were too complicated. I have 4 types of carriers and this makes #5. Some work for my husband better than me so I've kept them. This one is different, but only that. It's not really better than the rest. I was looking for one that served all purposes...back carrier for my husband, side and front carrier for me. I just got it today and it's complicated to put on...something that will get better over time, I'm sure. It rubs on my neck...also something that I can adjust if I wear something underneath. I really wasn't expecting the bulkyness. It has a lot of clips and straps that are and aren't used depending on the position, which make the installation harder than necessary. The Baby Bjorn at least has some tabs marked left and right. It would be nice to have these labled somehow. Once I figured out how it went, it was too big for my son (6 weeks) to be carried safely on my hip. Oh, and it's not really a 'hip' carrier. He's more to the side, which still makes doing dishes or anything else hard. He does like it and he even fell asleep in it, but when I went to unload him, it was a disaster. You have 4 clips to undo before you can get the baby out. With the Baby Bjorn, it was so easy to unload and lay them down at the same time. Once I had him unloaded, I had to unclip two more clips behind me, which woke him up. I'm sure I will get better at this, but for an all-in-one, don't expect the best. It still has the feature and problems of all the rest. I do recommend trying it to see if it works. I'm sure I will make use of it somehow. My son is a spitter and he wasnt even in it 5 mins before he spit all over it. I doubt I would have returned it anyhow."
81472,0,"I bought these bibs thinking they were ""soft"" plastic but they aren't really. Theay are just standard bendy plastic and my baby hated them. She could yank them off at 7 months old. You also get whatever color they feel like sending you. I bought two and received one pink and one blue."
11068,1,I like the way this seat is wide so my son doesn't feel to constricted and has a little room to move.I also like the way it sticks to the seat.The only reason for the 4 star rating is that it is very hard to clean. Even though I scrub it the bottom textured part still looks grubby.
88584,1,"Have been using these size 3 diapers for a while now and love them - tried huggies and believe that I'm a true Pampers fan. Once in a while, baby wakes up wet - I think that is parent error and a night time diaper may be warranted but day to day, these diapers are great!"
178950,1,"This came in very handy when my son was small - and I've heard from friends that it's even more useful for baby #2 or 3 - so you can hold older siblings' hands, etc. It does get heavy but was great for quick errands such as running into the bank. Hands free and easy to see the baby's face and interact more than without it. I received this as a gift and was very appreciative!"
141410,1,"I bought this gift as an early christmas present for my 7 month old nephew. He is just learning to sit, and I would not recommend this toy for any child younger than him as it would be very hard to play with if he couldn't sit up by himself. The second he saw it, his eyes lit up. He grabs at everything and listens intently to every sound that comes out of it and you truly can see the gears turning in his head. He is trying to figure out, ""OK if I do this, then it's going to cause that."" I think this is an absolutely great toy for the price. Its huge and seems pretty durable thus far. We have set up the walker for him and put it against the wall so that it doesn't move and he can play.As for the battery issue, it does say right on the box that the batteries included are for demo purposes only and that they will need replacing. I don't envision a problem when we add the ""real"" batteries as the demo ones haven't even died yet!HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOY!"
89425,1,"My son put these diapers to the test. Many nights he would try and exceed their capacity. As long as I changed him after 12 hours, I never had a problem."
166101,0,I thought I was buying the Swaddlers when I ordered these diapers. They sometimes leak and are inferior to the Swaddlers. I loved the economy size though and would order that many again.
59598,2,"I would rate this product with ZERO stars if I could. This product has got to be THE worst item I have bought since my baby was born. I followed the directions of installation to the tee, and it didn't last on my hearth a month. My 10-month-old has already pulled it off. Basically, anything that goes on with adhesive tape will be pulled off by the average baby. Lesson learned. If it worked well, I wouldn't mind the fact that it is a real eyesore on my living room. Unfortunately, it is an eyesore that has no practical function, and I have wasted my money."
37606,1,"These sensitive wipes are the best I've used. I've tried other brands, but they are often too harsh or thick and irritate my little one's skin. These are unscented, so no annoying smell. They are thick enough to clean up the really smelly stuff, yet soft and thin enough to be gentle. Delivery was slower than expected, but this was a very good buy and not having to go to the store every week for wipes was worth the extra couple days wait for delivery. Great product. Thank you Amazon!"
24209,1,"We registered for this swing. It took about a month for our little girl to start using it, but now she sleeps in it no less than once a day. The six speeds make it very versatile. We put her in it when she gets tired and she is asleep within minutes. Very light to move around the first floor of the house. I wouldnt want to drag it up and down the stairs. The straps are very secure and the head supports are good too. The only drawback is that the mobile will slowly rotate to the back of the swing(meaning it wont stay put) at higher speeds. Truth is that it seems rather difficult for a newborn to look up at it at such an angle anyway. All in all we are very satisfied"
52060,1,"i received this bjorn as a gift and though i don't live in a particularly hot climate, i've found it to be a wonderful item. my daughter was born in winter and i've had no problems carrying her for up to an hour at a time. initially i was a bit wary as this model lacks the lumbar support panel that the Original carrier has, but i've had no back/shoulder pain and my baby is 95th % for weight! i enjoy the lighter mesh fabric and it's really comfy for baby."
20376,2,"I don't know if it's bc i'm left-handed but most scissors work just fine, not these. I can't cut anything with them. They are dull metal parts that should be sharp don't even touch."
70792,1,This Rocker is perhaps the best thing that I have gotten for my baby! She loves it! The toys are big and bright and easy to grab. The seat itself apppears to be very comfortable (she falls asleep when she is finished playing). And perhaps the best part of all is that it is easy to pick up and take to grandma's house or wherever.
104016,1,I bought these stickers for my son's room & he loves them! They are very easy to put up & come off very easy if you need to relocate them. I definitely recommend them.
89527,2,Now I am sitting on a big box of diapers that don't even fit my daughter anymore. Very disappointing since I thought that this would be a good deal.
145435,1,my daughter who is just under 3 months old is entranced by the lights and sounds! She loves it! I put her in it today and allthough she can't reach the floor cuz she's still to short so I bounced her in it and she loved it! There is so much to look at and its really helping me to get her into wanting to touch things! She actually grabbed the little butterfly which is awesome because till now the only thing she's been interested in touching are her toes! So I love that it encorages her to interact with things around her!
69475,1,I always used Pampers. It's great that they're delivered to my door. It makes my life easier.
97160,1,"As soon as my friend's new baby arrived, I KNEW I was ordering this. I have given this repeatedly as a baby gift...... and everyone (and their babies) have thought it's the greatest!"
61980,1,"I bought these for my 3 year old son. He is potty trained, just has accidents at night...so we had him wear Pull-ups at night while we changed a few of his bedtime habits & we would wake him up in the middle of the night to see if he had to go potty. It took about a month until he became familiar with the feeling at night of needing to get up and having to go pee pee! We are currently just over 1 month of no pull-ups at night & no accidents at night!! YEAH!! Knock on wood...I think we are 100% potty trained!!"
83595,2,"We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first. I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it. The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in. As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer. There should be some way to fix it when it pops out. Definitely would not reccommend it. To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept."
181888,0,I sent this as a shower gift. My friend was thrilled and disappointed at the same time because the container was broken when it arrived. The shipping was not carefully prepared because the whole plastic container was put into a big box without any padding or bubble plastic to keep it from moving or being shifted. Her remark was &quot;I can't believe such a big company is so cheap and/or inconsiderate in shipping item like this&quot; :(
119788,1,"I am so grateful for the Bebe Pod seat. The tray and toy really make the seat useful. When my daughter first got the seat, she was at the stage when she couldn't control a toy in her hand. The toy on the Bebe Pod was excellent because it was at just the right height for her to teethe on and stayed put. Now she pulls it off the tray, but that's ok, because now she can control it.I sit her in the seat in the middle of the kitchen table and she watches us while we eat. We've also just started solids, so I use the seat with the tray and place mats to feed her. When I'm washing bottles at the end of the evening, I sit her on the counter next to me, and she chews her toy and jabbers to me while I wash. I never use the seat without the tray or toy. The pom is not entertaining, so she won't last long without it. The Bebe Pod Plus is a lifesaver. I don't see how a Bumbo without a tray or toy could even compare.Prince Lionheart b&eacute;b&eacute;POD Plus Infant Seat"
148354,1,"I had not heard about this product/brand until my 5th baby was born. We are doing ""elimination communication"" with him & this potty works well for his first potty. Currently (he is almost 4 mo.old) we set the potty on the changing table & hold him. For safety reasons, we never let go of him while sitting there. When he can sit up on his own, we will sit the potty on the floor. Eventually he will out grow it. We also purchased the BabyBjorn Potty Trainer, eventually he'll use that next. In the meantime the next older child is able to use it.I like that this potty is all in 1 piece. So easy to clean (no crevises to worry about). We dump the contents into the toilet. Add a little water, to the potty, from the sink (the potty easily fits into our bathroom sink to catch the rinse water) & dump rinse water into toilet.The size is nice for storing...it won't take up a lot of room. The size is nice because (eventually when he is older) he'll be able to get on & off it easily himself.I would have prefered this item in white instead of blue...but at the time of ordering the color blue was the best option (After an additional item was purchased with my order, I was also able to qualify for free shipping through Amazon). The colors available would not be the fault of the manufacturer but who I purchased it from.I was unable to find this at any of the stores in my local area. We would have had to drive 50 minutes or more away from our home to purchase it at a certain baby store. Then we would have also paid sales tax & our costs to drive there. I was pleased with this purchase through Amazon."
26097,2,"We purchased this seat for my son because we liked the other Peg Perego products but my infant son cried every time we put him in the seat. It was impossible to keep the belts open to put him in - we had to drag the belts and buckles out from under him. He was hot and uncomfortable and hated car rides. I switched him to my older Evenflo seat and he loves it, naps in it and likes car rides. I share this with everyone I know and hope others can skip such a costly mistake."
93884,1,This lotion is light weight and easy to blend in. My baby doesn't mind me slathering it all over her. It has a nice scent (citronella) and it does repeal mosquitos just as well as my bug spray. Would definitely buy again!
162149,2,"Trust me! This tub is not worth your time and money. I will have to agree with all the reviewers, the leaking issue is a huge problem. Moreover, we have to install cushions to avoid all the discomfort to our son from the raised part in the tub. We bought this tub but would pay safety 1st to take it away."
24558,1,"We bought this for our daughters playroom, bottom of stairs, and for another room in the house. This gate is a great buy; very sturdy."
137323,1,"This pillow is fantastic. I am so glad I bought it. I first wanted it to help me sleep on my side, since usually I am a back sleeper. It does help with that, but even more so, it is so comfortable! I sleep so well. During my first trimester when I was without this pillow, I did not sleep nearly as well. It hugs your body and offers so much support. I read some reviews that the pillow case was scratchy, but I have no problem with it (and I have sensitive skin). I did take an old, regular pillow case and cut the end off. I put this over the body pillow where my head is, so that I just have to wash that, not the whole giant pillow case. And yes, the pillow is big. We have a queen size bed and it takes up a little more than half the bed, but my husband still has room to sleep and hasn't complained. I plan on using this pillow long after the baby is born as well!"
23862,1,"I bought this item after reading about hip displasia. I was using a slimmer product and my baby's legs were too confined. Last night was the first night we used it. We put her in a thin short sleeved onesie and socks. We let her fall asleep after feeding and then laid the sleep sack out so we could just slide her in it. The zipper is at the top and you have to put the arms through the holes, zip the sack, and the swaddle. Luckily at night she does not wake easily, otherwise this would have never worked. I wish there were less steps. She did sleep well though the night though. She did have her arms out when we woke this morning and her arms were a little cold. If that continues I might just put a long sleeve onesie on her instead. I am pretty satisfied with this product."
127229,2,"I bought this for my 13 month old son who is quite big for his age thinking it would be a breeze to get in and out of the car. It is nice and light and folds up super easy but my boy is too big for it. He squishes in and if he squiggles forward he can actually walk and pull the stroller behind him! The sun canopy just got in the way of the easy folding so I took it off the first day I used it. The cup holder is great and the bag could hold your keys. I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend because it is small but I have never tried any other umbrella strollers, maybe they are all small. It is cute and I like the blue."
6463,0,My local supermarket sells smaller packs for less per diaper. Aren't you supposed to save money by buying in bulk ... and from Amazon? Amazon's pricing is disappointing.
22672,1,"Three pack and plays from different companies. This one is by FAR the better one. Bonus: It cost the least. Pros: easy to setup, easy to pack up, very sturdy, fairly light and seemingly the most comfortable. Cons: I haven't found one in 21 months despite my daughters hard work to find a flaw."
138045,1,I have bought 3 of them now and my son and nephews love it can't sleep with out it. Adults who see it love and want one of there own a sure hit!
127819,0,"This is the 6th monitor I have purchased. The 2nd that is 2.4 Ghz. It does pick up any sound, but you have to put up with the static and a constant clicking sound. The other 2.4 Ghz monitor has the same clicking sound. The nice thing about this monitor is that you can adjust the volume to exactly what you want. The volume control is very precise, with other monitors it is either too high or too low."
53157,1,i love my sippy cup. i am blind in 1 eye. i made a mess in my room. i use my sippy cup because i need it..i love it.
86201,1,"I carefully considered which video monitor I wanted to purchase and I decided that the Summer Infant Day & Night was the best choice in it's price range. The camera can twist and turn to many angles so that no matter where you put it in the baby's room, you can get a clear shot. I love that it can be plugged into an AC adapter or you can unplug it and take it with you. I used it when I went to play in the yard with the older kids while the baby was inside napping. I loved that I could just take a peek at him at any moment. It is wonderful for peace of mind. I also like that you can turn the video on or off which saves the battery life. It is also nice to be able to see exactly why the lights are going off on the monitor. With my audio only monitors, I always wondered if the baby was really waking up or just moving around and adjusting. I would always have to go in the room and potentially wake the baby up. This allows me to check on the baby without having to go in the room. It is so convenient. The viewing monitor is nice because it is lightweight and has a clip so you can attach it to your pants or belt if you are busy doing things around the house. The reception is great. We brought the monitor along on vacation and it worked wonderful there too.We also have used the monitor in the room with our 2 year old. She discovered on vacation how to get out of her pack n play. We put the video monitor in there so we could catch her in the act.I would highly recommend this product to any parent!"
24713,0,"The gate works well. I'm using it in a doorless entrance to the laundry room to prevent my cat from entering. I'm sure most cats can jump it, but my cat doesn't.I like that it's pressure mounted so it doesn't leave a mark on the door frame.The foot pedal works well and convenient when carrying items through.cons:The gate is just wide enough for a person to pass through. If you need to carry heavy items through the gate regularly, keep in mind that you might have to lift items above gate to pass through.My gate was delivered without the tool for tightening the brackets. Used wrench instead."
24808,1,This is a terrific gate that is unobtrusive and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone with children or pets.
105149,2,"I absolutely hate this thing. First all the little hole on top is too small for all but the tiniest newborn diapers. So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands. Then you cram it in the tiny little hole and poop inevitably gets all over the hole. And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip. So, yes, you need to take out the diaper and wriggle the handle. All this defeats the purpose of having a ""hands-free"" diaper pail! Get a regular old trash can with a pedal on the front, stick in a air-freshener, and save yourself some time and money."
73524,1,"I got the Itzbeen when my new baby was 6 weeks old, and I cannot think how I managed for those 6 weeks without it. Waking up in the middle of the night and trying to work out what time his last feed or diaper change was, was just horrible.I love the way this gadget knows that you are a sleep-deprived new parent! It is super easy to start using (no complicated instructions) and at the press of one button the timer is reset! The night light and clock is also great for middle of the night use when I am stumbling to his room!! Most definately recommend this to any new parent."
109133,1,"I love the Bumbo, but the tray makes it even better. It can be used instead of a high chair. Also, the tray brings toys up to the level of the baby for playtime."
116542,1,"This is a cute bag, but I must have measured wrong, because when it came I thought it looked absolutely enormous- I could definitely fit my 1 yo and a week's worth of stuff in it! The mannequin holding it in the photo must be a giant. Also, the photos online are deceiving in terms of the bag's structure- it is not at all stiff and does not stand up on it's own. Bummer because that's the whole reason I bought it, since my other always fell over. Unfortunately I think I'll end up putting this one in the closet until I have a big trip to go on when I can fill it up. Just too big for daily use."

154965,1,"I was in desperate need of a double stroller. When I had a newborn and a toddler, I got a Kolcraft Jeep double. It was heavy and bulky and nearly impossible to navigate. I recently purchased a double umbrella side-by-side, thinking it would solve my problems. While I loved the size and maneuverability, it was simply too wide to handle some door sizes and many store aisles in the city we live (forcing us to wait outside while family got to look around - no fun!). So, I began hunting for something better. I debated between the Safety 1st/Eddie Bauer Transit Tandem, the Baby Trend Sit N Stand, and the Joovy Caboose. After inspecting them all, measuring, and going for test drives, here are my results:Safety 1st/Eddie Bauer Transit Tandem:Weight - 33.8 lbs. (according to the Walmart website, but it sure didn't feel that high)WHEELS footprint (not to be confused with manufacturer dimensions) - 33x20TOTAL folded/collapsed size (including all attachments such as footrests, canopy, etc. since who wants to remove them every time?) - 47 long x 13 wide x 16 highOverall impression - I really liked this stroller: compact size, cushy child straps. The only problem I had was leg/foot room. My 3-1/2 yo daughter and almost 2 yo son (both VERY low on the height percentile, like 5%) already had very little in BOTH positions. Considering they will only get bigger, I would definitely recommend this stroller for smaller children, like 4-24 months. Otherwise, excellent navigation and good collapsed size.Baby Trend Sit N Stand:Weight - 25.3 lbs.WHEELS footprint - 40x21TOTAL folded/collapsed size - 50 long x 21 wide x 14 highOverall impression - Not bad, and if I hadn't tried the next one, this would have been my choice (by default). Fairly good maneuvering, although the parent cup tray was very cheap.Joovy Caboose:Weight - 24 lbs.WHEELS footprint - 31.5x21.5TOTAL folded/collapsed size - 46 long x 21.5 wide x 15 highOverall impression - Excellent! The very compact wheel footprint makes this a dream to handle. It fits in tight squeezes with ease, which was my main concern. The lack of parent cupholder doesn't faze me, since they're easy to add. Some people have negative comments on the sliding seat. While I can see how some wouldn't like this, in my opinion, it's not like it slides constantly and easily. It requires a little effort to move, so that doesn't bother me either. In fact, my 3 yo daughter LOVES LOVES LOVES (her words) this stroller, so I let her pick which color (she chose orange). This stroller is by far the most compact, affordable double and well worth the slightly higher expense over the BT Sit N Stand. That is, if you want a better constructed, smaller footprint, easier to navigate stroller."
88705,1,This is the best Baby Dry Diaper for your special little one. Your baby really stays dry and comfortable specially during the night and the fitting is great.
173322,1,"Overall, I really enjoy this monitor. The sound quality is excellent and has none of that annoying static that I found with the regular monitors. My only complaint is that it seems to drop and reconnect signal quite frequently when we're walking around. It always reconnects, but the ""beeps"" get a little annoying. I love, love, love the rechargeable batteries and the docking station is wonderful!!! The monitor was more expensive than the others (we've burned up 2 in a year) but I think I'm saving money by not having to replace batteries everytime I turn around. I would buy this monitor again. I also like the compact size of the parent unit, it's easy to wear clipped on and has no antena to catch on everything!"
152427,1,"Huggies Supreme are the best. Our son is 6 months old now and we have used them since the beginning. When he was newborn we bought a pack each of luvs, pampers & huggies to see what we liked best. After just 2 diapers we ditched luvs completely- TERRIBLE fit and very plastic-y feeling. Pampers were better, but i hated the fake baby powder smell they put in their diapers- it reminded me of the baby powder smell they put in your car at a car wash. They also leaked. Huggies supreme was the very best hands down. The feel soft & cottony, no chemical smell, excellent quality as far as design and attention to detail- i love the velcro like tabs and soft stretchy banding around the legs. Since my son is in them 24 hours a day, he should be comfortable and dry. They work so well that he has never had a diaper rash! ; ) Also, as he's gotten older i hate to wake him in the middle of the night for a diaper change . . .with huggies supreme he can go 10-12 hours and still have dry skin (if needs be). Pampers left his tummy wet and skin wrinkly after one long afternoon nap! All in all, I recommend Huggies Supreme to any mom i meet. Hooray for Huggies!"
162593,1,"I do not understand the negative reviews. I have used this tub since my daughter was able to take a tub bath at week 2. Babies should always be supervised and for not one minute should a parent's eyes be taken off their baby while in ANY tub. I have not had any problems with my baby's foot or toes getting stuck. After reading some of the reviews I tried to stick a finger in the areas where other baby's feet and getting stuck. One thing to note is the areas that fold lock into place when opened. They can only be closed by moving two areas on the underside of the tub so there is no chance of a those two areas on each side of the tub collapsing up. They &quot;click&quot; into place when opened. I also could not get my finger through any areas where water can flow through. I always keep one hand on my baby and use the other free hand to bathe her. Now with any tub an infant (and any young child), could have a serious accident if not supervised. One strong point about this tub is you can drain it while baby is still in there to get the soapy water out and clean water in. I refill her tub by having the tub set far back in the tub and using a pitcher to fill it back up. Now this tub does not need much water and the complaints about it not holding enough water are silly. A baby does not need to be neck high in water. This is plain dangerous. At the young age when baby cannot sit up it is not play time in any tub. Be a careful parent and you will not have problems with this or any tub. I happen to be very pleased with this tub. Also on a side-note with a baby having his or hers legs resting on the little ledge a parent can easily clean the private areas without having to lift baby up to do so. I recommend this tub to all new parents. Works great on the counter until baby gets too big then I suggest putting this tub in the bathtub. Thanks Safety 1st for such a good tub!"
159694,2,I loved this bouncer when I sawl it.I liked all the colors and the fish overhead.My son loved it.It was all great until I had to replace the battery for the massager.Once we did that the bouncer rattled.I can't turn it on anymore and he loved it.I am so upset with this product.Do not waist your money.
137375,1,"i love this pillow! it was just what i needed. i dont like to be touched in my sleep and my daughter like to jump in the middle of me and my wife on occassion, i sleep like a baby, and it keep me from getting touched! and my wife calls it my girl friend!kmax"
166866,1,"We have had our son in Halo sleepsacks ever since we stopped swaddling him. They are great! We've had cotton, fleece, and this velboa one. The velboa is definitely the softest and possibly the thickest. It's difficult to tell whether the fleece or the velboa is thicker/warmer. I wish the velboa sleepsacks were more widely available in the larger sizes. We're going to keep my son in them as long as we can. He moves around too much in his sleep to use an actual blanket. Seriously, he's rolling all over the place all night.The one thing I think these sleepsacks are missing is a snap tab that would cover the zipper. We've actually talked about sewing one on because our son has become very interested in unzipping his sleepsack to the point where it has kept him awake trying to unzip. Our nephew went through a similar stage when he was obsessed with the sleepsack zipper so I'm thinking it might be a common thing. I understand that you wouldn't need the snap for really young babies, but it might be good for toddler sizes.Overall, we love these and will continue to put our son in them until he'll no longer fit!"
129679,0,"I disliked using a shield in general, and fortunately was able to get my son to latch at 4 weeks without it. He finally started gaining the right amount of weight once I got rid of it so if you can avoid using these completely, try to...they can hinder the nursing process causing baby to not get enough milk.If it is absolutely necessary for you to use one, this works fine. In fact, our lactation consultant prefers this one because it exposes more skin. For me, though, it was more difficult to use because it didn't stick or stay in place as well as the Medela version. I'd imagine it is a complete matter of personal preference, though, so it's worth trying if you are struggling with the other."
64197,1,"I wasnt to disapointed with this box it did have a little bit of dirt/dust on the bottom left side of the box but seeing how it is cardboard covered in cloth it will tend to get dirty if you dont take care and I was stupid enught to get the ivory one ;p. It is pretty sturdy for what it is and looks really nice, its also bigger then what I thught it was going to be. If you have or do buy the pearhead scrapbook or photo album there is space/slot to put it in the box aswell but ofcorse if you have big items like shoes and baby cloths you might need the space. To conclude not super happy but not overly disapointed with the box we will just have to see if it holds up."
179127,1,"I used these bottles with both my son (now 5 yrs old) and my daughter (who is 6 months old). Both my son and my daughter had problems with gas, spit-up and fussiness as infants. These are the only bottles that I found that helped both of my kids! Trust me, I tried every bottle on the market for both, and both times ended up with these. I would highly recommend these bottles to anyone that is looking for: gas, spit-up and fussiness relief for their baby :)"
52015,1,"I purchased this for my husband so that he could carry our little one on his dog walks and around the house when he's home. He loves it. It's easy to put on and get the baby in and out of. We've only had it for a few weeks now and we don't have any negatives. It's breathable too, which is great for the humid days we were experiencing in Dallas. All in all, would recommend this product to anyone expecting a baby or has a baby who loves to be held all the time (which we do)."
47198,0,"Written by the Husband but my wife agrees with me!My overall opinion of the Joovy Double Stroller is relatively simple. I give it four stars for the look, the colors, the cool features but unfortunately 2 stars performance. I did not have high hopes after setting the stroller up when I saw the main problem: 4 wheels instead of three and the types of wheels used.If Joovy would make one simple change to their strollers, I would rate the stroller most likely a 5 star for performance and looks! It is a cool stroller to look at but NOT...I repeat NOT to push.PROS- Cost is reasonable- Design (minus wheels)- Colors)- Features and Gadgets- Stand or Sit Feature- Perfect for walking around a mall (not through a store: just the mall)CONS- VERY hard to push with two kids on a sidewalk with driveways. Every driveway you come to, the stroller will not steer straight but will move to the left and want to go down the driveway to street.- You need two hands to operate. Can't drink coffee or anything while pushing it outside. It is possible...just not easy- Very difficult to turn with two kids no matter where you are, and I'm a tough guy writing this article, not my wife! We both agree with my conclusions! :)- Because it is a 4-wheel stroller and long, it feels like it is going to break when I turn a corner or turn at all.Conclusion or SuggestionIf Joovy changes to a three wheel design, the balance will be amazing and this stroller will ROCK. However, if they do change to a three wheel design, they should use rubber wheels that you inflate. Otherwise, you'll be replacing the cheap foamish plastic material that is currently on the wheels once a year on normal use.It would take the work of a creative engineer to find a way to make a three wheel Joovy Stroller, but it is the ONLY way to compete with the BIG Dogs: Phil & Ted. I have had a Phil and Ted for 2 years and can't brag enough about it! It is expensive but worth EVERY Penny. I love the Joovy concept though...and wish I could speak highly of this stroller!"
81549,2,Terrible static. The first one I bought was fine for 4 monts then it turned all static. I returned it and got a second one. The second one was immediately static from the begining. I'm going to return this one also and buy a different one.
113182,1,"I'm glad I read the reviews for the standard breastshields. I now have 3 sets of the standard breastshields (and just purchased a 4th) and 1 of the soft fit. The soft fit have warped over time and don't fit well. Before that, they would stick to and tug at my skin-- at times very painful! It may seem counterintuitive but the hard plastic ones are much more comfortable because they don't pull at the skin and they work better because the shape doesn't get distorted."
83284,0,"Cute design, but the handle is very difficult to move, very stiff! Other than that works great!"
150118,1,"With bright colors and bold patterns this is one of the most cheery gender neutral sets I've seen anywhere.Our little one loves to snuggle up against the plush bumpers, and the coordinating pillow is just right for her sleepy noggin.The bedskirt makes the plain little crib look so much more solid and cozy, and the bright colors and geometric patterns bring so much energy and color to the room without being overbearing.Being on a budget, I put off buying this set until a few months ago. But, I couldn't be happier with this design, and am glad I held out as I did.The fabric seems soft yet durable and the colors have stayed true. My only criticism is that this fabric blend seems especially prone to wrinkle. So, be sure to grab it from the dryer while it's still warm.Otherwise, it's a hit."
93352,2,"These blankets were on my registry... i put them there after i read the reviews here. But on the very first wash, they began to give way around the edges and started to fray... very unsightly.I give 5 stars for the fabric...very soft...but the fraying spoils it."
174365,1,"Having gone through breast cancer, this adjuster helps to take the pressure off of the shoulder whendriving. It is very useful to me."
37656,2,My only concern with the product was that the experation date had already past by the time I had recieved the product.. I am expecting and was hoping to stock up for baby but when I had seen that they were past the experation date it made me not want to order wipes from here again..
70111,2,"I used this monitor for 6 months, liked the reception when far away from the nursery (but not when too close!), and then it stopped recharging. Thinking it was the battery, I searched 4 stores and finally had a battery store MAKE me a replacement battery.... Only to find out that it still would not keep its charge. Fisher Price no longer makes this unit, and will send me $40 in coupons for me to buy another one... in 6 weeks!!"
141374,1,"This is a great toy, we bought one because my son's cousin was using it and really enjoyed it. HOWEVER, it came with BOTH missing legs. HOW CAN A BIG COMPANY LIKE VTECH FORGET SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND MAKE THAT BIG OF AN ERROR. I know it's not a huge deal, it's just so annoying, my son keeps trying to walk around with it and it keeps falling...Will never buy Vtech again."
31179,0,"I have the 2006 european version which is the same besides the seat fabric. Its a cool stroller but I haven't used it yet because its been broken for almost a year now and dorel won't help resolve the problem. The hydraulics are set inside the main tube and presses against a metal piece which reinforces the stroller when expanded, and bears the force when you collapse the stroller. Well that metal piece broke no longer has the hydraulic action. While I can still manually expand it and it still locks into place, I dare not put my son on it because without that hydraulic piston reinforcing the weight, the stroller with collapse. If anyone can help I woujld appreciate it.Another problem is the tire started leaking but I managed to find Innertubes from a sporting good store to replace them. In case you end up with a puncture or leak in your tires ( As many or most people will ) You want to replace the innertube with a 12"" tube."
93975,2,"I bought this item for my 3-month old daughter. I took her out in it once and it was awful. If the hood is snapped on (a zipper would work much better here, or better yet, make it all one piece), it kept flapping over my daughter's head. And when we unzipped the body section while in the car, the two sides kept closing over my daughter's face. I couldn't find a good way to keep her ventilated and keep her face exposed so she could see and breathe. I returned this item immediately and bought a Bundle Me intstead."
121233,0,"We decided on this seat because it looked the most comfortable for our daughter and we liked the simple design of it. I find that my daughter does not like it, and the only way we can get her to not cry when she's in it, is to put her in it asleep. She likes the chairs that bouce, but this one just vibrates and she does not like the vibration at all. At 2 months old she's already to long for it, her legs hang way off (and no she is not long for her age). We do have the papsan swing and she loves that!"
37779,0,"I purchased them so my 12 months old will start holding bottle by himself, they really didn't do the trick. And my DS started holding bottle by himself without handles. If I knew, I wouldn't bought them, because we never used them."
174724,1,"This is a wonderful product, and far exceeded my expectations. I wanted a mobile that would grow with my daughter, instead of being tossed aside once she grew out of her crib. Only concern I have with it, is that the entire unit is long. If you plan to install over your crib, and are frequently in & out (as I am), you will get caught in the butterfly antennae (as I do). My daugther loves this product! She was about 10 weeks old when we installed it. She would sit for hours, mouth open, in complete awe of the fluttering butterflies. Now that she is 4 months, she is less fascinated, but still interested during diaper changes, etc. Great product!"
6228,2,"For the price, I would have expected better performance. Lucky for us it was a gift. The audio performs passably, although I found the maximum volume, on the video monitor at least, was too quiet. The video signal never worked reliably when the units were upstairs & downstairs, respectively. The interference from the cordless telephone, however, was unbearable. With just two channels to choose from, it was impossible to clear up even after trying all the channels on the cordless phone. I am much more satisfied with the Sony Baby Call 900 MHz 27-channel monitor (audio only though), in all respects."
157758,1,"My husband and I bought this monitor because our baby had to be on an apnea monitor for a month after she was born. We were sceptical about it's sensitivity, but it has proved itself. Our baby is now 3 months old and the monitor's alarm did go off last week in the middle of the night. Our baby is fine, she had her arms and feet in the air when we got to the nursery.The only little problem we have with the monitor is that other plugged in items, even a lamp, can cause interference noise on the monitor."
115412,2,"Even though this seat comes with a guard for boys, it doesn't go high enough, so if you're standing in front of your toddler while he goes #1, you better watch out cuz you're gonna get wet."
87769,1,"We used this toy when my daughter was a couple of weeks old. She would just lay there and look at the toys. The older she got the more time she would spend &quot;swatting&quot; at the toys ( a good 20 or 30 minutes). However, by the time she was 7 or 8 months old she was able to pull on the toys hard enough to bring the whole set down and we had to put it away. I wished it lasted the whole first year. Another great thing about this toy was that it folded down so we could store it under her crib."
146070,1,"This is a well made product and worth the price. It is a little basic compared with equivalent 'bouncers', but it certainly contains enough entertainment for our baby to enjoy without being overly distracting. It was easy to assemble."
86328,1,Bought this for our first child 2 yrs ago and just got a 2nd for the next one. They've done something to the camera that has really improved the picture - it's very clear! Overall we've loved this monitor. The only thing I'd say to not rely on is a bright color picture - overall the colors are fairly muted unless you're in an extremely bright room. But that hasn't bothered me at all - it performs well & was well worth the $$ for the camera monitor.
39961,1,"Original review: February 21, 2005I bought this machine before the birth of my first son 3 years ago. I used to lay in his room before he was born and relax listening to the different sounds. We started using the ocean mode when we brought him home from the hospital. We still use it every night and take it with us whenever we spend the night away from home. At three years old, he now makes sure that he turns it on before going to bed. We are expecting our second son in a few months and will purchase a new one just for him.I have looked at other machines, but like the fact that this one can be used with an AC adaptor. We let it run all night long and the others just eat up batteries for the same initial price. I also like the fact that the sound comes through on our monitor. It not only helps me sleep at night but I trust in knowing that my monitor is working as well.One downfall, I wish the volume was a little bit louder. All in all, a great product!!!Updated: Sep 10, 2005 - Great Customer Service Too!We did purchase a second unit for our newborn son. The packaging has changed and now allows for a store demo mode. The new unit was stuck in DEMO MODE and did not work properly. I contacted DEX Products and a new one was sent to us immediately at no extra charge. I have changed my review from 4 stars to 5 stars due to the great customer support (and the volume seems to be louder on the new unit too)."
39464,1,"My ten month old wears this to bed. It is great quality, warm, soft, durable, and easy to launder. It keeps her quite warm, and since she rolls around in her crib, it's better than a blanket because it goes with her, no matter what position she ends up in."
19531,0,"My wife and I ordered this table and chairs after searching far and wide for something durable, cute, and the right height for our 2-year-old daughter. So far, we are happy with the selection. The set was fairly straightforward to assemble, all the parts were enclosed, and the tools required weren't exotic (just a screwdriver and the included wrench).My only quibble is the size of the plastic bins. They are big enough to accomdate coloring books, crayons, flash cards, and SMALL toys like a ViewMaster. But we couldn't put her puzzles in the bins because their weight made the bins tip over. So, if you are intending to store large, heavy items under this table, you'll be disappointed. But if you're storing just arts/crafts-type stuff, you'll be okay."
80724,1,"When I began to potty train my active two year old I read the parent reviews to help me make my decision. I had also found that Pampers Baby Dry diapers were superior to other diapers for my daughter. So, I tried the Pampers Easy ups. They too are excellent. (No leaks, easy off and up fit snuggly.)"
106377,1,"ABSOLUTELY NO ODORS!! I have a beagle who completely ignores the diaper champ, will eat out of every other garbage can in the house, but ignores the champ. a bit of a struggle as diapers get bigger, but totally worth the money!!! also, a bit of a pain to clean...either outside with the hose or in the tub. No refills and odor free..can't beat that!!"
86486,1,"I'm very pleased with my monitor. The picture is clear and the sound works great. I keep it plugged in at night, though, because the battery does not seem to stay charged long enough. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
47774,0,"I bought this wedge because my baby was choking/gagging everytime she was laid flat even when she was upright for 40 minutes after feedings. It does help somewhat for reflux - she didn't spit up as much since we've been using. HOWEVER - a new problem since using this is that she ROLLS down the wedge (even when she was only a week old!!) and ends up at the bottom of the wedge, on the flat part of the mattress. TWICE I found her FACEDOWN on her belly at the bottom of the wedge or halfway down the wedge. Which is not a great way to prevent sids...Mine came with two parts that fit in the cover and has a zipper...It does fit the entire length of a crib or pack and play, and even if your mattress/crib is a little larger, it goes UNDER the mattress so it shouldn't matter if it is a little small.I would LOVE to figure out how to get her to STOP rolling down the wedge - I roll up a towel/blanket and place it under her booty/legs in a U shape, but I worry about her putting her face in the blanket/towel too. So either way... kinda dangerous. But I'm afraid to keep her bed flat because of the choking/gagging...If I find something that helps, I'll add to my review...I like this, it is useful to reduce reflux, but the rolling down it (even though it doesn't make the mattress incline that much!!) is really a problem too!"
131316,0,"While this hamper is very cute, matches the crib set perfectly and is suprisingly sturdy... I followed the washing instructions to a T and the fabric shrank. It says to tumble dry low... I would suggest hang drying it. While it still fits on the frame, it's hard to get on and is very tight. I considered returning it, but it's still functional."
80126,1,Sheyenne loves it!!! I was looking for something just like this and searched until I found it! Thank You!!
157144,1,"When shopping for a breastpump 7months ago, I passed on this pump and opted for the Ameda Purely Yours, which worked fine up until last night when the motor broke. Since I pump exclusively and plan to breastfeed exclusiveely until my son is 1yr., needless to say, I needed a new pump immediately. I was looking to replace my Ameda but local retailers don't carry that brand. I ran out to BRU and picked up the Medela PIS. I LOVED this pumped from the MOMENT I began using it!!!!! Like the Ameda, I am able to pumped both breasts, but with the Medela I get my 8-10oz out in 1/2 the time. Now it only takes me 5-10mins MAX and I'm done. This is perfect since I pump 3 times at work. I love the sleek backpack. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5stars is because the entire assembly is much heavier that my old Ameda, but that's okay with me. Everything else about the pump is perfect. I don't mind the 2 bottle top caps...nothing leaks through them..so who cares if they're not regular caps. I'll definitely recommend this pump to anyone who has to pump more than 2x per day. I only wish I had gotten it sooner instead of the Ameda. Now that we're planning on #2, I feel confident that this pump will last through that 1yr of breastfeeding that baby too."
141533,1,My baby recently began walking and loves this item. It entertains her while she walks and when she is tired she can sit and play. Worth every penny.
155149,2,I woke up to a hysterical baby because he had been screaming (for who knows how long) I am a heavy sleeper and rely on my monitor to wake me up when the baby cries... This monitor turned off in the middle of the night and completely stopped working after a month of use. Its the right idea (portable and small) if only it worked!!!
169500,1,"The other reviews I read about this bag made me hesitate to buy it because a lot of them said the bag was not big enough. But I went ahead and got one anyway and honestly, if the bag were any bigger - it would not comfortably fit on a grown human being. The style of the bag (as a messenger bag cut) would not work. It would be too bulky.It may not have all the space that a super-huge diaper bag may have but it's got enough space for what you'll need. And most men I know only carry their wallet, cell phone, and keys with them. All that fits in here with the baby stuff. For a woman, a lot of us have lots more in our purses that must be combined with the baby stuff in the diaper bag (hence the need for a larger bag) - unless you plan on carrying two bags and baby.This bag is perfect for dads."
27066,1,"I have been wearing my Mini Cradle for about a week and I have noticed a pronounced difference. It eases the pressure on my lower back, and greatly lessens round ligament pains. It is seriously worth the $15!"
32258,2,I bought this bottle for my aunt who recently had a baby. I take care of her baby alot and wanted to find the right bottle for him. He tends to have gas so didnt' want a bottle that would possibly cause more. This bottle makes a sound while he is sucking that sounds like air being suck in. It sounds like he is swallowing air as he sucks. The positive thing is that it is a inexpensive bottle. It also did not leak at all. It was easy to clean. The only problem is the air I hear. I placed the bottle down after a feeding and I hear the air being sucked in. So I'm going to continue my search in finding the right bottle.
43110,1,"I absolutley love this stroller!!! We live in Japan where things are small...stores, streets, & trains. This is the perfect alternative to a cumbersome full-size stroller. Super easy to put together and the basket holds a full diaper bag. Turns on a dime and folds up easily--what more could you ask for? Only downside is that with the carseat in place it is a little difficult to reach the basket, but, if you place the diaper bag with the opening facing you it can still be accessed by reaching in. I am not looking forward to giving this up when our little one outgrows her carseat."
133187,0,"Yea its a good system, but the thing is that the refills are expensive, its 19.99 for the refills, where as the DIAPER GENIE is only like 3.99 big difference, and I heard it works great as well. Thats my only complaint for the decor.Other than that ,its a nice looking pail , and the smells are eliminated, but if youre looking to save money this isnt for you!"
41055,1,Cruisers are so comfortable for my daughter. They feel comfortable and they mold nicely to her body. They also don't leak even through the night which could be up to 10 - 11 hours. Other diapers feel rough and are stiff when putting them on her.
90974,1,Rarely leaks! Recommend to friends and family. I only buy Pampers if I can help it. Great product for the price.
116067,1,So happy to find this organic cotton hooded towel. Happy with the fabric that it has. I ordered this for my new grand-baby. And my she loves it...
164627,2,"I have used 3 different brand diapers for my twins since they were born, huggies, pampers and luvs. When they were little I stuck with pampers sensitive because I felt those were softer and kinder to their skin. When they got bigger I went with luvs because of the price, then I discovered amazon mom and its many benefits including its low prices on diapers, so I switched to huggies, and realized how much better huggies are compare to luvs! We've been using huggies for the last 9 months. Now the last time I needed to buy some diapers, pampers was running a coupon on amazon so the price per diaper was a little lower than huggies, and I figured, why not give it a try, hence, I bought these pampers baby dry. What a bad move! These diapers leaked after an 8 oz milk and some juice, I mean, with huggies such liquid intake would hardly ""make a dent""! So now I am using almost twice the amount of diapers compare to when we were on huggies. These are worse than luvs, at least luvs charged you less for it! I actually feel these are very much comparable to luvs diaper in terms of quailty and ""structure"", just more money, it's almost like both were made by the same people but were marketed differently. So if you are thinking of getting these, save yourself some money and buy luvs instead. I don't understand how they could advitized it as ""last up to 12 hours""! That's if you don't feed your kids any fluid for 12 hours I assume! How could this product get so many good reviews on here? Maybe a lot of people use pampers exclusively and didn't have a chance for comparison? I would have returned these if I had not thrown away the box. What a rip off! Do not buy these, get huggies snug and dry instead!"
177894,1,"I like this item. The only thing is that you have to make sure you put the valve in properly, everything is snapped into place securely, for it not to leak. Once alittle part of the valve is not snapped in properly, it will leak through the spout and the vent hole. Also 7oz was too small for my toddler so we eventually had to graduate to a bigger cup. But it's hardy, withstands knocks and throwing, and lasts a very long time!"
93851,1,"The Superyard itself is a wonderful product, but the extension gives your baby so much extra room! Actually we used the yard for a kennel for my friend's 4-month-old puppy!"
140673,1,I purchased this lotion for my baby because I didn't want anything with harsh chemicals in it. Well I definately received what I was looking for. I love this lotion. It smells like an orangsicle and is not greasy or too heavy. I would definately recommend this product and am so happy there are actually people out there that care enough about our children to make a safe product for them.
75496,1,"I would of given it 5 stars because it is so nice but it is very time consuming to put together and there were two holes that were not pre-drilled like it was supposed to be. However once it was finished it exceeding my expectations, gorgeous piece!!! WE love it and it is a great size- not cheap looking. This looks like you bought it at a fine furniture shop!!!"
115647,0,"I love the layout of this bag. I love all the compartments, I always know where everything is and I have just enough room for what I need to pack. My issues are with the zippers. First of all, the zipper on the very bottom zipper for the little pouch in the middle are so touchy that it can take me up to 10 minutes to get them closed. This is a BIG issue when you just needed to grab one thing, then close the bag and go. If I'm holding my 7 month old and trying to close the bag it an even bigger issue. If I give up and leave it open everything falls out. My second issue with the zippers is that the zipper pulls are always falling off. I have actually lost 2 and another 2 are always falling off. Without these the pouch on the bottom is impossible to open. I've tried hammering the zipper closed to keep the pulls on and they just won't stay. This also causes the zippers (because they're open too far) to get caught on my daughters clothes all the time. Otherwise, I love this bag."
40891,0,"We are in the midst of potty training now, and lately I have noticed that when my toddler ""holds"" his pee for a while, and runs around in these diapers, the little beads inside that form the gel when wet, tend to crunch together while still dry, and irritate him. I am going with the pull-on diapers instead, in combination with cloth diapers. No point in trying to encourage potty training if a dry diaper is irritating!"
76034,1,"The trays are really convenient. I am breastfeeding and I pump and store the milk in the trays. I like that you can pop out whatever amount you want, since they are in about 1oz cubes. Very good product."
69542,0,"I had wanted to put this on a wall but did not look at the dimensions prior to ordering. The letter is very small, but quite detailed and will now reside on her nightstand."
37023,2,"I wanted a seat to replace the Britax roundabout for a tall (but light) 3yr old. I bought this one, and I am returning it.The tether is extrememly difficult to use. It should be like the Britax kind when you can tighten it after the seat is in place, but you have to adjust it to the right length BEFORE you put the car seat in! Also when using the 5pt harness, the shoulder strap is not held as secure as I am used to with the roundabout. The belt locking clip does not keep the seat securely fastened when the shoulder/lap seat belt type is type where the belt has a latch plate that slides freely along the strap."
36333,2,"I recieved the Graco Tango in the Tongo diaper bags that I had registered for as a baby shower gift. It looked good on paper. But on the larger bag the inner plastic lining ripped at the zipper within two months (really not that big a deal it as the bag still functioned, but still...) and then the strap came unstitched where it attaches to the bag at 4 months. I used the bag heavily, the baby and I have been on the go every day since he was born, but I feel it really should have held up better than this. The little bag got used maybe twice, so getting this product for that reason wasn't such a good idea. The Graco bag also is not nearly as well designed from an organization stand point as the one we are using now. I wish I had done more comparison shopping before registering for this product, and didnt let myself be swayed by the cute pattern."
169319,1,"I ordered the Pampers Swaddlers Diapers for my daughter and she loved them! She said they were absorbant, kept my Grandaughter clean and dry, plus they were adorable. She also liked the economy pack which has 234 diapers! Saved her trips to the store and gave her more more time with baby. She has dropped the ""other brand"" and now only want's these."
65270,1,"I truly use this console bar every time I use my BOB. I put my keys, phone, and water bottle in it while I jog or just stroll. I do think it is overpriced though."
175526,0,The gate is heavy and strong but it is hard to open and it comes off the wall easy. I guess its ok the price was nice.
130551,1,"This swing was a life saver. I received the swing as a shower gift and we used it until our son outgrew it. I highly recommend this to any parent or grandparent. At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but was well worth the money. I hated to see it go."
68832,1,"Best diapers out there, IMO, and the online price at Amazon, with Super Saver Shipping is comparable to the wholesale clubs."
34250,2,"We bought this product based on the good reviews by other customers, but now realize that those reviews were based on previous models of the Britax Frontier. The new Frontier 85 SICT is wider at the top, and the bag won't zip around it unless multiple people stand on the carseat to cave in the SICT pads, and have another 2 people on hand to struggle with getting the zipper to barely close. I had to use it for a trip because I had no time to return it beforehand. It took 3-4 people to get the carseat in the bag on both legs of travel, and I definitey can't use it again (the seams around the zipper are already ripping from the strain). Probably good for older models or other brands, but was a total waste of money for us."
90118,0,its been a while since i ordered. as i remember everything seemed to be ok
54537,0,My 6 month old son loves to look at this mobile. The characters and colors really hold his attention. I think it serves it's purpose well. I have complaints however...sometimes it won't shut off or it won't change the tune. The buttons just won't work! It would also be nice if you could just have the mobile move without the music on.
8398,1,This is the best bottle holder I have had thus far. It's simple in design and does what it needs to do. I love how the water can drain into the sink because all of the other ones I've had got moldy so quickly. It's very sturdy as well.
110569,0,"Durability: 5 starsFolded Size: 5 starsUnfolded Size: 2 starsPadding: 4 starsValue for the price: 4 starsStorage pocket: 3 starsWipes case: 2 starsIf you just want something very basic, this one is okay.I got this when my son was a newborn; he is now almost 2 1/2 and I have been using it as my all-the-time changing pad at home. I felt a little uneasy about using it in public restrooms, because it doesn't give a lot of coverage. If you decide to buy this, the coverage problem could be remedied by carrying some of those disposable changing pad and putting that over top, or putting paper towels over top. I liked changing my son on this if he was in the stroller (if you have a stroller that reclines flat).The reason I am giving this 3 stars: The storage pocket doesn't hold anything with much bulk, so I couldn't put diaper rash ointment in there with the wipes. Or at least you cannot close the darn thing if you put anything with bulk in there. The wipes case that comes with it requires both hands to open it.It has been very durable, though. I just noticed a small crack in the interior of the pad, and I think that's actually from my dog. The black exterior of the pad has worn well--nice tough material.If you lay it on burber carpet or certain types of upholstery, the Velcro closure will stick to the carpet!The pad that came with my Skip Hop diaper bag works just as well, without these problems, but it doesn't have a storage pocket.All in all, is compact, cushioned, waterproof, and less expensive than almost anything else on the market."
159487,1,"Apenas vi el producto quise comprarlo ya que me gusto el color y la forma de la silla para bebe... una vez en mis manos el producto fue facil de armar ya que las instrucciones lo hacen mas sencillo... el producto es bonito, amigable a la vista, comodo para la bebe, tiene un sonido que es agradable para la bebe y las figuras que cuelgan tambien lo son... tiene un opcion de vibrar para relajar al bebe y si deseas meser al bebe tambien lo puedes hacer ya que la forma de la silla asi lo permite.. de verdad me siento complacido con esta comprar ya que la bebe pasa un buen rato del dia recostada en su silla y no llora..."
106900,2,"This is a good concept, easy to use, no special bags etc. BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie. ALso, watch out for the smell. I feel like the plastic has permanenely absorbed the poop odor and no amount of cleaning or bleaching can get it out. I'm expecting another baby and don't plan on using it."
115926,1,"The bumkins organic line of products are simply fabulous. We have bought the towels and washcloths for our twins. They are so soft, have super absorption and dont feel so wet after use. Definitely one of the best buys that we have made in recent times."
176036,1,"This is a really cute bag, despite the plastic-y covering I don't feel like it screams diaper bag! diaper bag! It is quite large, the pic on the site is a bit misleading, but I can still tuck it neatly under my arm. My other ""big bag"" is way too bulky for that and usually has to go inside the shopping cart, this one doesn't. And the changing pad is nice quality and extra-long, super for a toddler. Definitely recommended! (Though if you're looking for one of these hyper-organized deals with lots of pockets, this is not the bag for you. It really just has one main compartment, with some small pockets outside and inside.)"
40852,0,"I tried the cruisers on sale when the Pampers Baby Dry were the same $ amount. I was unhappy with the results. It leaked more often than not. I couldn't put him to bed in them. He had several ""blow-outs"" with them. I won't use them ever again. I'll stick with the pampers baby dry or seventh generation."
60444,1,"My baby is one month old and we love the eurobath! It's spacious and comfortable, he likes being in the water, other bathtubs have a seat out of the water. It also has a plug on the bottom which makes it easy to empty. I love that it holds an older baby too."
84481,1,"After waiting 6 months for Target to come through on a swing order and then their cancelling, I found this one on Amazon. I put it on the swing set, so it is perfectly balanced. It is easy to use and comfortable for the babies."
66241,1,"My son is 9 weeks old and has been a &quot;difficult baby&quot; since he was 5 weeks old. Initially they changed his formula to Alimentum which worked pretty good (Dr. tests confirmed milk protein allergy). He then was diagnosed with Reflux and put on Zantac. Still, his gas was unbearable and he'd scream in pain sometimes hours at a time. Finally I switched from Johnson Healthflow bottles which I used with my daughter to Dr. Browns. I can't believe the diffrence! The first bottle I gave him he spit up a lot and then cried after and I though &quot;oh no this isn't working!&quot; After he spit up I gave him a warm bath and used a thermometer rectally to stimulate the rest of the trapped gas which was probably there all day. After that, the next bottles were all PERFECT! He drank them with ease and not one air bubble was in the milk and the nipple never collapsed. I was AMAZED. He still has gas, but passes it easier and doesn't scream in pain. This bottle DOES NOT LEAK. It's amazing. Go buy it now! For approx. 5 dollars a bottle (less if purchased in a 3 pack) that is a small price to pay for a happy baby who isn't screaming all day or night. Just 5 dollars!"
33727,0,"It was a good price for a sturdy gate, but the latch is a little hard to use."
17005,0,"my husband purchased this gate as a block for our new puppy. Its a decent gate but installing it was a challenge(lots of screws and washers and plastic doo hickeys and poor instructions...I mean come on its should be easy! ITS A DOOR GATE!)But the real pain is the latch itself! its not easy to open or close, with one hand and its just seems rickety and unstable. I know a toy breed puppy may put more wear and tear on the gate then a toddler ( i dont know, i dont have kids) but the darn screws keep coming lose, and it rattles all the time. It looks nice, and its cool to see clearly thru to the other side, but its more difficult to open then the product claims. One hand no. two hands and a lift, yes. I end up climbing over it. I give 3 stars for the hassle in mounting and the difficulty opening and closing the latch."
77394,1,"my baby enjoys her afternoon nap time in it. unfortunately, she's soon gonna grow out of it...but the time she spent in it was worth the money i paid for it..."
27233,1,"I am a first time mom with a 6 week old colicy baby who is usually up and fussy from around 10pm to 2am. My sister gave us an old Graco swing saying it would be an absolute lifesaver. My daughter ended up hating it. I hated it too because it didn't recline enough to support her neck, plus it wasn't very sturdy. So I took her to Babies R Us, where you can try the different swings out. Luckily she was very fussy at the time, even in my arms. She kinda liked the Nature's Touch swing but it was 40$ more and took 4 d batteries for 100 hours of continuous use. Then I saw almost all of them took 4 d batteries for 100 hours. Then I put her in the Baby Einstein swing and I am not kidding, she got quiet and happy. She loved the sound effects and the flashing lights on the tray. It also had a harness seat belt and reclined enough so she could fall asleep without her head bobbling around. I also noticed that It took only 3 d batteries for 200 hours of continuous use! There was another family shopping for baby swings at the time and when they saw how happy she got in the swing they decided to buy it too.That night she honestly slept from around 10pm to 2am. I actually got nervous because she was sleeping so long and woke her up! Oh, I also love how sturdy it is and that it easily folds down to store away or move around. It is the best swing Babies R Us has. Or at least my baby thinks so."
80678,0,The pampers easy ups for girls is a good product to use for toddlers however the only downfall is that the sides to not come apart without you cutting or ripping them.
6456,1,If they are leaking you need a larger size or better yet use pampers easy ups and start to potty train.
4619,1,"I was surprised that these earth friendly diapers actually feel soft and work. I don't think they are as good at preventing leaks, but good enough that I'll buy more."
74560,1,"I love this wash, I've used it on my daughter a few times (thankfully with no reaction, however I perfer their standard lavendar body wash or burt's bees milk bath for her) however I use this everyday for myself, it is wonderful for shaving!!! Love the smell, love the consistancy, love love love it!"
108291,1,No more spitting the pacifier out of your newborns mouth. The wubbanub pacifier comes attached to a host of adorable stuffed animals and has just enough weight to hold the pacifier in your babies mouth--as if you were holding it in yourself. It is my favorite baby shower present. When it works (not all babies like it) there is nothing better. Nothing.... unless you want to stay up all night and soothe your baby yourself.
69394,1,this is a great diaper - we have tried others and pampers seems to be the best fit for our son - we have used them on him since he was born and are now at the final size in the series. hopefully he will be out of them soon!!
92264,1,"My newborn was nursing great until he had to be fed from a bottle for one day, he had troubles latching for the first time because of the bottle. I quickly went out looking for some sort of bottle that was similar to nursing and found the breastflow bottles. He never had troubles again! I was able to go back to work and not have to worry about nursing problems because of bottles."
47315,0,"It looks nice, but isn't actually useful to accurately measure how tall your kid is. The ""ruler"" stitched on didn't match up with a tape measure. Also I'm not sure how to mark measurements on the fabric. Velcro didn't stick."
154469,2,"I bought these for the lack of chemicals and extras, but was disappointed in that, like someone else mentioned, the ones in the plastic containers are very dry. We have to wet them to get them to work better. Also, they smell sooo bad. They don't use a fragrance, which isn't a bad thing, but the products they do use in the wipes smell disgusting. I am pregnant so my sense of smell is heightened, but my husband doesn't particularly like the smell either. We won't be buying these again. The Earth's Best wipes smelled better, but we had a lot of trouble getting the wipes to come out. We kept having to rethread the wipes through the lid of the plastic container."
17027,2,"My husband and I revceived this monitor as a shower gift and we couldn't wait to try it out. We were disappointed about a few things:1. The video part had some interferences.2. The sound was poor- especially as we brought the video part closer to the camera unit.3. BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT: The parent (video) unit always has to be plugged in with the AC adaptor- you can't use batteries- not convenient for a Mom on the go.For about 105.00 with tax, these problems were unacceptable. We returned it and bought a portable security camera from The Sharper Image- the best purchase yet!My advice- check out The Sharper Image store on ebay and you can find a similar, but better product for about $120- Believe me, it's worth it!"
77147,0,"I bought the Nature's Touch Papasan Cradle Swing by Fisher-Price in October 2005 when expecting my 3rd child that December.When he was born, he (and thus the family as a whole) *loved* the swing. I loved the neutral colors. The music wasn't overtly annoying (for a change), and that its volume could be adjusted. The cradle portion looked and felt soft, thick, and comfortable, and was easy to remove for washing (became even softer with fabric softener ;-) ). Loved that it had so many different speed settings and loved that it had 2 different motion settings.When he was super little, I kept it fully reclined, and it was like he was being cuddled in mom or dad's arms as he was rocked side-to-side. I also added additional support via the Kiddopatomus carseat padding that has thick sides as well has head/neck support. As he got older, switched it to its ""upright"" position (still slightly reclined), and away he would go. He liked the mirror ""ball"" well enough, but never cared one way or the other for the mobile and its ""friends"".The swing power was very good --though it would slow down considerably (and understandably) if a blanket dragged or hung down below the cradle seat -- in either direction; I rarely used the highest speed as I found that to be *too* fast unless batteries were dying.Battery usage was typical, but not too bad considering its frequent use. Rechargeable batteries are a *must* for any battery-only-operated *anything*, IMO.I forget how long my son was in this swing -- up until at least 6 months, I'm thinking, if not longer. Can't remember. However, this swing was loaned out several times over the last 3 years; my friends and I got my money's worth out of it.Unfortunately (and what drops the rating down by 1.5 stars for me), now that I've had my 4th child, my friend who used it for her son just over the last year returned it to me, and it no longer works properly. It stopped swinging. The music and mobile work; the swing does not. It costs approximately (at least) $50 to fix (might as well buy a new one for that, which is what I'm going to do; plan on getting the Starlight with plug-in adapter this time). It just stopped working out of no where; one day all was well, the next, nothing.Then it started working again a few days later when I was complaining to another friend about how it no longer worked... only to not work again the next day.I figured out that if I put my son in it and pushed it and *then* turned it on, sometimes it would work and keep swinging. However, if I didn't hear the sound (kind of a knocking sound) of the motor, I knew it would eventually come to a stop and thus wake up my baby and annoy me. Sometimes if I turned it off and then back on, the motor would kick in. Today, though (and last night), it has not, and therefore, I'm getting a new one (different model) because my new baby has decided he likes the swing after all... when it works.This baby loves the mirror already (he's 5 weeks), and notices the mobile and its ""friends"". Don't know how much he cares for the mobile though... it doesn't make him cry anyway. :-) He does seem to prefer the cradle rocking over the swing rocking, but then that's because of its positioning next to my desk; he can watch me that way.Overall, a very good swing and I recommend it with rechargeable batteries (else get the adapter version); however be aware that it might not last you as long as you might think. If it wasn't for me loaning it out, it wouldn't have lasted through more than 1 (of my) baby, since almost 3 years later, it's kaput. I prefer for my baby things to last at least through 2 kids.Now I'll be purchasing a new swing for only 1 (as this is my last) baby... but that's what eBay is for."
162083,2,"I received this tub at my shower and heard good and bad comments about it. I decided to give it a try anyway. The first 3 times we used it on the counter, it was fine. After that, it leaked everywhere. We couldn't figure out why. It was put together correctly. The mesh sling is nice, however, it is prone to mildew even when rinsed thoroughly after each use. I don't recommend the tub."
84853,1,"I bought this crate for my new dog, and I just love it. It is a very good looking, well-made and easy to assemble product. I think it is worth the price because with a standard wire crate, you'll need to spend another $40 on a cover to create the den atmosphere. I wasn't sure of the size, but the Small just fits my 19 lb Corgi.UPDATE: I wrote this review in 2007 and now in 2012, the crate still looks brand new. My dog sleeps in it every night and hangs out in it during the day. I don't close the gate anymore;she stays in it becuase she loves it. It's perfect den. The price has increased about 25% since I bought it, but I would still buy it because she loves it, it looks great in the house, and I can't imagine that I'll need to replace it anytime soon."
20072,1,"When a couple has a baby, it opens up a whole new range of possibilities and choices, the vast majority of them on uncharted territory. When it comes to feeding the little guy and a bottle is needed, my niece had gas trouble with the original nipple for the bottle. But since she got these, the baby is less gaseous, happier, and that means his parents sleep a little better at night. This now is her preferred brand, thanks to the Vine program."
88176,1,"Five hurrahs for this toy!This is the toy of the moment in my daughter's world - she'd spend her day there if I didn't bother her! At 3 months, she's beginning to reach out to explore the world around her. To her delight, she can kick and bop the toys attached to the arc over her head. She loves the simple song played by the seahorse, she can grab the octopus' legs and pull them to her mouth, she loves to gaze at her reflection in the mirror on the turtle's belly, and the rainbow and whale both rattle when hit! There are two really nifty things about it from a parental point of view: it is light and folds up easily for storage and travel (it fit perfectly in my suitcase, so we took it with us on vacation). Also, all of the toys are on plastic links, so the toys can be rotated to new positions or taken off completely and attached to some other device (perhaps her stroller when she's older)."
30761,1,"We really love this monitor. Especially since it has two parent units, we too leave one upstairs in our room for at night and one downstairs for her naps during the day. We have not had any problems with static and we do have satellite TV, wireless internet, several cordless phones, etc. The sound is very clear, however, as other reviewer have pointed out, the lowest setting is still pretty loud, but it is always clear. We rarely use the parent units off of their charging base as they are easy heard without having to be right next to you. The few times we have used them off of the base the battery lasted about 3-4 hours. Overall we are very happy with this product."
161223,2,"I got mildew in the crevace of this tub where it expands. I always washed it afterwards, but ended up throwing it out and buying the one piece cheaper one."
62559,2,This product was a gift and it is more trouble then its worth. I only used it for about a month and it was such a pain. I would rather just empty the trash can once a day then mess with this thing. The odor was still present while using it and when I would open it to put a diaper in it the horrible stench would become even worse and would linger for hours. It is now sitting in our garage until we can give it away.
78323,2,"I needed a compact booster seat for traveling. I purchased this one and was very disappointed with it. First of all, I feel the straps are very unsafe. The 2 straps which should come from the back of the seat, actually come from the bottom so it secures the child very low which allows them to lean over the sides. The tray is difficult to put on, in both positions. And my daughter is an average sized 7 month old and will not be able to fit in the seat with the tray on for much longer. The only redeeming quality is that the straps retract into the seat so that they are not hanging out while being transported. (Not quite a trade-off for my child's safety.) Needless to say, I will be returning this product."
111231,1,"Very pretty nursing cover, nice quality cloth, I do think it's not a necessary item but I haven't really started using it yet since still pregnant with first child."
60985,1,"You have to get the hang of this little item. I agree that the first few diapers don't stay in their little &quot;pods&quot;, so you have a clump of several diapers until they're heavy enough to hit the bottom, then the subsequential diapers make their little pods just perfectly. It does fill up quickly, but it contains the odor really well. The old model (small mouth) was very stubborn and difficult to work with but this one is much easier. It's easier to get the diapers in and cut the &quot;links&quot; when it's full.Until they come up with something better, this is what I'll be using.The refills are spendy but I think they last a decent amount of time."
89502,1,great for the money. Especially if you sign up for subscribe and save and amazon mom discounts. I like it more than many other brands i tried.
134011,0,"I got this warmer as a gift. Overall I really like it. The annoying thing about though it is that the lid pops up all of the time. I have resorted to using a small piece of tape on the cover so it will stop popping up. Other than the annoying lid problem, the warmer works well. I use cloth wipes in the warmer."
32182,2,"I bought this for my main bathroom, and was disapponted as it is chipping all over, and will not last more than 1 year. Will replace with a large plastic hamper which gives more depth but takes up the same amount of space. Looks nice if the paint did not chip and pieces of wicker were not falling off as well."
12153,1,"I bought this pillow when I was about 4 months pregnant because my back was starting to hurt. This has been a life saver! We have a queen bed, and this doesn't get in the hubby's way at night. It is not very big, but I don't like the big pillows. This one is just right. I have been using it for almost 4 months now and wouldn't give it up for anything."
49410,1,"My kid LOVES putting his hands on my cool stuff. This is not okay. The dog listens, but the boy doesn't. We don't use the yard to corral our kid in the traditional sense, but 3 sections as a baby gate for our wide hallway and 3 sections wrapped around my TV. No more tiny fingerprints."
74060,1,"The Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem stroller was exactly what I wanted. Functional, colorful, lightweight. Couple of things I thought wouldn't be that bad is not having a parent tray, well, its actually a little annoying not to have something so simple already on. The other is its definitely not for long rides,the front doesn't recline all the way and of course the backseat doesn't have a back.If you know its just walks you go on then great but not for day trips to amusement parks or such.Otherwise GREAT item!"
61054,2,I wish I would have read some reviews before registering for the Diaper Genie.It fills up too quickly. Dumping the diapers is a pain. The refills are expensive. It does not contain odors very well. I'm thinking about using a garbage can with a lid instead of the Diaper Genie.
28461,1,"I really love this glider. The material is very soft. The seat cusion is actually very comfortable, I'm not at all sure why some people complain about it. I am 7 months pregnant and weigh 190 pounds/5""7 and am completely comfortable in this chair. The assembly was SO easy. I am not the type of woman that normally puts things together but my nesting has started up so I took on the project and had no problems whatsoever. The instructions were very easy, all the holes lined up, and I loved that I didn't need any tools. The shipping on this product seemed to take forever I will say. I ordered it while in stock and it didn't even ship out for 3 days. The package did arrive exactly on the very last day of the estimated delivery date however that is late to me from how quickly amazon normally gets their items delivered. At any rate I am super happy with this purchase. Can't get a better set for the price and with free shipping. I would recommend this to anyone."
23393,2,"This was the worst diaper pail, so far. It does not lock-in oder. Save your money and buy something else."
68025,0,"We purchased this bag to keep our stroller from getting dirty and to keep our stroller for accidentally popping open and having someone break it if that happened. We have used it on several trips but the aggravation of getting our stroller in it proved to be too much. This bag did protect our stroller from what we wanted it for and so it gets good marks there. But it will not hold up if you travel by plane a lot! And if you have a stroller that is even an inch too big you will be fighting with the bag, as it is mostly made for a compact umbrella stroller.We have a Peg Perego Pliko and while it fits, it is a nightmare to get in and out of the bag, just an FYI."
46921,1,"I thought I would want this pack to be able to easily take the baby along without holding up the rest of the family. That is exactly how it has worked out so far! While we haven't been on any serious hiking trips yet, this pack is just as comfortable, around the yard for an hour or so, as I had hoped it would be. The baby seems quite content and life goes on without having a baby in your arms or a stroller in the way. I couldn't be happier with this product. As expected, Kelty knows how to make a backpack!"
47574,1,"Was it worth spending the extra money when baby would only use for 6 months or so? Heck yea! I would gladly spend any amount of money to make my life easier with a newborn and to get more sleep. I bought this because I wanted the baby in the room until he was ready to be in his real crib. It's nice to have baby close by so you can feed or tend to the baby's needs immediately.I didn't attach the sleeper to my bed because you can just easily keep it close to the bed with out it moving. It has wheels on it so it is very portable. I had it in the bedroom at night and rolled it into the living room during the day for the first 2 months of baby's life. I also didn't need the attachments to make it taller.It's a little tricky attaching a mobile because it doesn't have rails like a normal crib. But there is a little opening that enabled us to use two different types of mobiles at two different times. I have a Fischer price projection mobile that wouldn't stay up without some extra support. So, I put a sonicare toothbrush travel case between the base of the mobile and the co-sleeper rail. It's working out great! The hard firm plastic supports the mobile and there is no hazard to the baby.Keep in mind: The original co-sleeper can be used longer since it's bigger and converts into a play pen.I DON'T like:*The mattress is attached to the crib with Velcro. It's a pain in the butt to replace the sheet when the Velcro keepsattaching to the back of mattress as you try to put it back on.*The mattress is becoming uneven from use. Noticed this after about 2 months of use.*I noticed the material under the mattress is sagging (when mattress is taken off) from the baby's weight.I LIKE:*Portability, a little heavy but at least it rolls around.*Extra storage space underneath the crib*Easy access to baby at night*CompactScore: A"
20940,0,"I really liked these burp cloths. They were fun, colorful, good quality and cute. They wash up well, keep their appearance, and are especially nice with the matching receiving blanket. I gave them a 3 star rating only because they are fairly expensive for 2 burp cloths, and have since found similar burp cloths for less money. They make a great gift for the mommy who has everything."
133083,1,"I bought the Dekor because a friend of mine said that the other leading diaper pail did not work well. The Dekor definitely keeps the smell at bay but ONLY if the pail's lid is COMPLETELY closed. So, when the diapers start piling up and keeping the lid cracked open, you better change out the bag. I only had some minor problems with it. First, the swinging &quot;door&quot; that you drop the diaper into gets messy sometimes (because of diapers getting stuck to it), and second, the foot pedal on mine broke off. I can still push on the metal bar to open the Dekor, but if I don't have shoes on, it can be a pain. Overall though, this diaper pail does the job"
119010,2,"On child #4, this is the fourth travel system I've owned and the worst by far. The ONLY things I like about it are the handle on the car seat with the ""wiggle"" in it which is why we went Evenflo in the first place and the print. Otherwise my list of complaints is endless, but here are a few of my least favorite things....1. The fabric is not soft by any means2. The straps are absolutely impossible to adjust (seriously, we cannot adjust them), making it dangerous because they're never quite tight enough3. The sun shade is a joke as you can only pull it forward about 4 inches, we end up putting a blanket over it4. The stroller is impossible to unfold one handed without hurting yourself5. The stroller does not completely recline flat, so no diaper changing in it6. The stroller straps are weird and barely fit my 4 month old7. The tray has somehow managed to already break without any helpWe had a very similar set for child #3, born in 2007 which we were reasonably happy with for the price. I expected that the product would have improved but apparently that's not the case. Had I bought this in a store instead of online I would have returned it. Unfortunately, we could not find an Evenflo travel system in our area and now we're stuck with it. Totally bummed, buy something else!"
116323,0,"My wife and I bought this in anticipation of our first child. We really liked how the baby is angle toward you rather than sideways, and didnt find many other changing tables set up this way. We ordered this from Target, and had to return the first one due to the trim pieces being broken off during shipping. The second one was the same way, but I opted to just fix it myself rather than return it once again. Aside from the packaging problem, I think it will work out okay for a while, but its nothing great."
48276,1,is a great product for keeping an eye on the little one - esp across the rooms.Was a little apprehensive that it would not work - I have a 900Mhz cordless phone - and still this one works.thanks
94546,2,"I see where others have stated that if you read the directions these bottles will not leak. That is NOT so. I am an educated person and I have checked and re-checked the bottles, they are assembled correctly. These bottles are awful about leaking, and sometimes you can just turn the bottle a certain way to keep them from leaking, but it is very frustrating to leak your hard-earned breast milk from a poorly constructed bottle. The other reviews are correct unfortunately-the nipples are the best and that is why I continue to use them. My daughter will not take any other nipple even after trying other brands. She likes the advent ones. My recommendation to all moms would be to not even start with the advent ones. I have been told the vent aire from playtex are great and never leak. ???"
110769,1,"This review is strictly about the assembly and sturdiness of the item. I haven't delivered our baby yet so I can't comment on the use...This product was very easy to assemble. It took all of about 20 minutes from beginning to end. It is also very sturdy, we are pleased so far. We have a pretty tall bed so the leg extensions were are must for us. I am very happy with the product overall. Excited to start using it =)"
61786,1,I just bought this carseat because my baby is outgrowing her britax companion. I have put her in it a few times and she loves it..it is so comfortable. I am a big fan of britax car seats..they are expensive but this is one area where I don't mind spending the extra cash to protect my baby.
92225,1,This is the best bottle ever. My 2 month old refused to take anything other than the breast and after trying more than 4 brands of bottles this one worked and worked well. It has a letdown effect just like the breast so baby wont get confused and she went back to me for a feeding without hesitation. Highly recommended.
44624,0,"I chose this stroller because I found it to be easy to open and close after several traumatic hours of trying to open and close the other strollers at Babies'R'Us. I like the reversible handle alot. We've used it in carriage mode exclusively since our baby was born 3 months ago and our son loves sleeping in it. I've used this stroller in department stores and at the airport with some minimal stress. It can be difficult when aisles are too close or jammed with merchandise.This stroller is not good for:1. walking sidewalks in neighborhoods with mature trees that force the sidewalk up.2. anyone not smart enough to figure out how to adjust the wheels when you reverse the handle (this includes me)3. anyone with back problems -- it's not real heavy, but it's not light eitherThis stroller is good for:1. traveling (day trips or longer) because it offers a nice comfortable and flat place for your baby to nap when you're out and about.2. hauling lots of extra gear - the basket is huge."
6212,2,It arrived in a box however the plastic it was packed in once you opened the box was so dirty and black I just knew I would have to send it back however once I took it out the plastic it wasn't damaged or dirty at all just very wrinkle
88923,1,"Honestly the easiest way to find a great diaper for your son/daughter is through trial and error. There are certain sizes of the Pampers brand that I was not a fan of, however through trial and error sizes 4+ have worked out well for us. The couple of times that he has leaked through the diaper has been in the middle of the night, otherwise they have been a great diaper for an active 2 1/2 year old who pees a lot. Plus, it's super convenient to have the subscribe and save option through Amazon!!"
84789,0,"I bought these because my 2 year old son has figured out how to open the front door. They work great.Cons:- If you have to lock and unlock the door often, it is hard to get to the lock- I have a hard time opening the doorPros:- Child cannot unlock the door- Child cannot open the door himself- Easy to installOverall this is a good product, but might pick a different knob if I had to do it over again."
136207,1,This is a wonderful product if you have a baby who likes to keep busy and you can't keep up! Our 4 month old girl LOVES it. She didn't like the swing or any other product that didn't keep her upright. The only reason I took a star away is because it is difficult and time consuming to assemble but other than that I highly recommend it!
64700,1,"We bought this set when our son was just starting to reach for toys, hold them in his hands, etc., and we couldn't have picked a better set. All of the toys have something easy to hold on to, especially for tiny hands.By far, the best in the bunch is that fish though! This has been his go-to toy for months now. I keep it stashed in the diaper bag whenever we go out, and he never seems to grow tired of it. He's ten months old now, and we're still getting use out of all five toys.As another reviewer said, everything can be washed in the dishwasher. I've also thrown the fish in with a load of laundry before."
170156,1,"I love this crib!! This is the second one that we have purchased, we bought one a year and half ago for my oldest, and it has held up wonderfully. It is very easy to assemble, it is very light in weight (for a crib), but if you are not careful, it will tend to scratch easily. This was a great deal for a great crib!!"
49486,0,"We bought this to use as a fence around an area of the living room that was a little dangerous for our son who nine months old at the time and starting to really get into everything. It filled the purpose we hoped it would fill for a couple of months, but as our son got older, stronger and more determined, he found ways to circumvent it.He would push and pull to move it around, and when used as a fence he'd push the end of it around and slip past it. It was still more useful than not, but after about six months the level of usefulness started to drop.Then by the time he hit one and a half years old, he found out he was able to climb over it. That ended the period of its usefulness. He can now get out by climbing whenever he pleases, which simply adds the danger of a fall to whatever danger we were trying to keep him away from in the first place. And there is danger of a fall. Sometimes when he got to the top, he'd get an ""oh no, what do I do now?"" look on his face.So we got nine months out of this playard/fence. Not too bad, maybe, and it did keep him significantly safer for maybe about six of those months, before circumventing it became a lot easier. If you are on a tight budget, you might want to think about this level of investment for so short a time."
141922,2,"tried this for our stokke crib, our daughter chewed it off in one night and it wouldn't stick back on. Got the cloth product and it works great"
84289,1,The swing is exactly what we were looking for in safety and the price was well within the range of what we where looking for.
32687,1,"This certainly is a sturdy carrier, but I do have reservations about it. We took it with us when we went to another country to adopt our daughter. We actually had to help each other into the thing all the time because it kept getting tangled up behind us. Admittedly, we were probably excited (it's not every day you go to another country and get a baby!), but we're not dolts either. It really took some maneuvering to handle getting the thing on our bodies, which you want to do correctly, of course, because it's a BABY you're carrying and don't want to drop! :D We bought this because it was supposed to be so comfortable. The shoulder straps were fine, but there was pulling on our upper back and neck muscles. Also, please look carefully at the *size* you're ordering. We ordered what ""came up"" on the Web site, not realizing that we were getting a small. Our daughter weighed 18 pounds when we got her. Three months after we're home, she's almost too big for the carrier. So we paid $95 for something we used for two weeks. Our fault, but choose wisely. All in all, I felt the baby was secure, which was great, but the thing wasn't completely comfortable."
138553,1,The first Twilight Lady Bug we owned got thrown across the room when my daughter was little and broke. So we had to have another one and got it through amazon. This is one of the best products out and great to help babies up to toddlers go to sleep at night. It is so fun to see the stars and moon on the ceiling and even when my 4 year old goes for sleep overs at grandmas the Twilight lady bug has to come with us. Highly recommend this product to anyone with children.
71142,0,"I really like this bouncer because of how long it can be used. The reason I gave it three stars is that once your baby reaches toddler stage and can climb into the chair on her own, you have to really supervise and make sure they stay sitting. I turned my back one day for about a minute and my daughter had stood up in the chair. As I turned back, she grabbed the back of the chair and leaned so that the chair rocked back and she would have flipped over with it. Luckily I caught her in time. Now I don't let her use it unless supervised and make sure that she sits only."
36094,2,"If you have recently purchased your Svan chair you don't need to buy one of these (your chair should come with one). It is identical to the one that will come in the box. We bought an extra just in case and have never used it (we have two Svan high chairs).If you have an older chair that didn't come with a plastic tray cover this is a must have, it fits perfectly and is easy to wash."
158107,1,"This is the greatest monitor. I would and have recommended it to anyone. It is great to know that if baby were to stop breathing/moving for more than 20 seconds the monitor lets you know. There is times there are false alarms (baby off the mat) but as my husband and I look at it, BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY!"
112799,2,"I too was deceived by the picture of plate, cup and bowl, only to find that there was no plate in the set. I think this amounts to false advertising and shall certainly not buy from Macy's again."
12427,1,"Unlike the other reviews, I find these bags easy to use and convenient. The twist ties allow you to pump right into the bag which saves me from having to wash bottles everytime I pump. The other bags require you to pump into a bottle and then pour it into a bag which defeats the whole purpose. The medela bags also allow you to get all of the air out which can destroy the great quality of your milk if left inside. I store the bags upright (just in case, although I've never had a leaky bag) in a milk storage tray I bought from Babies R Us (the First Years brand). Once they are frozen, I put them in ziplock bags with the date written on them for easy retrieval when I need to defrost milk. When I am ready to defrost, I just stand them upright in a large bowl and let cold water run for about 5 minutes, and them pour into bottles.My baby never got the hang of breastfeeding, but I really wanted her to have breastmilk. She is 2 1/2 months old now, and I have been pumping milk since she was 3 days old. I eventually chose to bottlefeed exclusively, so I pump about 5 times a day. I use an entire pack of 50 bags in less than a week!!! I pump way more than she eats, so I have a lot of stored milk. Plently for when I go back to work and can't pump as often. Take it from someone who really knows. These bags are not difficult to use as everyone else will have you believe. If they were, I wouldn't use them considering how often I need to use them."
131973,1,"I really like this swing. I have three kids so when I need to help my older kids get ready, or if i have to finish getting ready myself it is great to be able to put the baby in the seat and have him fall asleep to the swinging motion!"
74569,1,"This crib set is beautiful! The picture does not do it justice. The materials used are truly baby soft - from the gingham on the blanket to the chenille on the bumperpads. The bumperpads have ties on both the top and the bottom which is almost a must to keep babies from getting trapped between the pads and the rail of the crib. The double crib dust ruffle is as beautiful and this is the perfect inspiration for any Mother to ""Bee""."
124102,1,"I Bought the entire Springs Car bedding set for my son and I love it. The lamp is great, it provides me with enough light to diaper changes and feedings without distrubing my husband and it keeps my son in sleepy mode, plus its really cute and you get most of it on sale with coupons at a toys r us store. I got the whole room decor setup for about $130!!"
182419,2,"I can not believe I spent $7.95 plus shipping for what essentially is Vaseline petroleum jelly! Even though there is hardly any odor, what you can detect is it even smells like Vaseline! What a waste of money! I could have bought a jar of Vaseline three times as big for at least half the price! Save your money!"
54961,1,matches perfectly with kitchen decor. Easy to assemble. Perfect gift for 10-mo-old grand-son. Thank-you
127312,1,I absolutely love this crib! I bought it for my daughter in the spring of 2010. It is very sturdy and great quality. I love the color and I really can't think of anything bad to say about it. You can't beat the price that comes with this quality. I purchased the changer and the dresser as well and love them both. I will probably buy the same set for my next child or at least buy a product from this brand. Love it! :-)
2552,1,This is a nice box to purchase wouldn't have needed to buy diapers for 2 months but my son out grew this size before we ran out we had to order the next size up:)
162921,1,"I purchased this product to match the DaVinci Emily Crib we bought 5 months ago. I was a little concerned about the quality of the material used for this product based on other reviews, but the product is as good as any other particle board product can be. The packaging was good, the wood finish is good (and matches with the crib) and more importantly it was quite easy to put together. I would strongly recommend this product along with the crib (see my separate review for the crib)."
49741,1,it's just tall enough for my kid to reach the sink...which is the point of it. it does not slip on the wet floor though which is something that couldn't be said for our last step....so that's nice.
159300,1,"This bouncer is a must for babies newborn on up. Our little girl is nearly eight months old and still loves this very durable chair. The vibrating feature is nice when the baby is new but becomes less necessary in time. She still loves the dangling frog and pulls the string often. Our little girl has taken inumerable naps in this chair. When visiting relatives in the midwest, I bought another one and had it shipped so we'd have it there. Can wash cover if stained. A great value."
135453,0,"This Baby Monitor performs adequately, but not great. We can definitely hear when the baby cries, and the red lights indicating noise is an added bonus, but there is a constant static that you hear as well. The static is not too loud, but noticeable. I'm sure results may vary, but for the price and functionality, this still works okay for us."
59489,1,The Diaper Depot is great! It keeps everything very handy on the changing table. I haven't had a problem with my little one trying to knock it off or anything. I would highly recommend this!
52515,1,"My husband I weren't so sure about this swing at first. Our baby didn't like it until recently. He is 3 months old and loves to look at the fish designs, the lights, and the fishy toys. The music doesn't captivate him though. Also, you have to be careful when placing the baby into the swing because of the bar. Otherwise, this swing is nice to have. It is lightweight and is great for traveling. This soothes our baby when he is fussy."
74521,1,"I got this for a co-worker for her baby shower. I don't know if she ever used them, or even if they work, but we all got a good laugh out of them."
42787,0,"I used the Moby wrap a lot. My daughter hated it first but after trying it out at home a few times and getting used to how to wrap it, she liked it and it was quite handy. A lot of times I would wrap it at home and just leave it on. It also took some time to get used to putting the baby in and out. I only used the cross wrap where she faced me or faced away from me. But after a few washes (according to instructions) it shrank to the point I could not wrap that thing around me and tie it. I am 5'6 and 140lb. Also, my daughter was growing incredibly fast and my back always hurt.I don't think the back problem was due to the wrap though. At 22lb I had to stop using it. It was just getting to heavy. I don't know if a different carrier would have been better. expecting number two I think I will try a different one."
68053,2,"This product is made of very cheap nylon, ripped on first use, didn't even make it to our destination before ripping... might as well just check the stroller and risk it as is...not worth the effort."
44583,0,"The Uptown Dots Boppy cover is actually much lighter in color than pictured here; it's not unattractive, but the colors are much more on the pale pastel side. More to the point, the fabric is a cotton muslin that's thin and a little coarse (you wouldn't want sheets made from this material) and since the washing instructions say to dry it only on the ""low, delicate cycle,"" it seems pretty clear that it's ready to shrink upon washing."
469,2,"These diapers do not work at all! We had been using Pampers Swaddlers and they are great. Unfortunately, I saw that I could buy these for a few dollars cheaper and decided to try them out. They do not work. We have been using them for about a week and EVERY time my son has a poopy diaper, it's a complete blow out. Even when he is upright, it somehow leaks out the top of the back of the diaper. We had been using the Swaddlers and only had one blow out in 4 months. Maybe these diapers work with older children with firmer stools, but they do not work at all for us at this age. Besides the constant blow outs, these diapers have a plastic, cheap feeling. Pampers should be ashamed to put their name on them. So, instead of saving a few dollars, I'm now buying new diapers even when I have around 200 of these diapers left."
68425,1,"My son had nearly maxed out his infant seat in mid-winter at 5 months of age. Obviously he was still too young to walk and I didn't want to buy a bunting or something that would be short lived and too bulky and hot in the car. But I was having a terrible time trying to carry him from the his convertible car seat to whereever and still be bundled up in whatever concoction of blankets I could arrange. Plus, no matter what I did to keep his head or arms covered, unless he was wearing footed PJs, his pants would hike up when I carried him leaving several inches exposed to our cold, dry winter air. I found this product through Target.com and searched Amazon for more color/size choices.I had a little bit of a hard time figuring it out at first. I think it would have gone smoother if we'd started younger and gotten him used to it before he learned to stick his arms out the strap gaps at the shoulder or push back the ""hood"". However, even as we've been getting warmer weather I have really appreciated it. It's great for stroller walks and bundling him in and out of the car. Once he's in his car seat, I can throw back the ""wings"" so he doesn't get too hot. And I am so much more comfortable knowing his little legs are definitely protected without worrying about massive b"
49840,1,"I brought this for my 2 year old granddaughter to keep her out of the fridge.It works great,the only problem now is she is mad that she can't take everything out like she was before lol.Wonderful product.Highly recommended."
67283,0,I purchased this as a quick fix to block off our kitchen from the living room. I have a more permenant one I use for other areas but I wanted something quick and easy to put up and down in this one area. It's just OK. I wouldn't recommend this as your main safety gate. It's lightweight and easy to set up but not very durable. There is no way to adjust for uneven surfaces like with some other gates. There are much better options out there but at this price you can't expect too much.
129762,1,"My son is 19 month old and 35"" in height. He is a big boy. Last month he climb out of his crib and almost fall on the floor. Instead of buying a cover of crib, we ordered this bed on Amazon. It arrived quickly and without scratches, and easy to put together.My son is very exciting to go to bed time now. Before he cried every night when we put him into his crib. The first few days he can't stop climb in and off of his little bed. He also can't stop showing his new bed to other family members when them visited. He is proud of having a real bed. Even though he is big (at his age), this bed is still pretty roomy. I think it's a great bed for transition from a crib to a real bed."
3432,1,"Shipping was quick, got for extra parts for my pump that is awesome and I want to be able to use it for a long time."
